<ANSWER PAGE="699" SPEAKER="Hill, Sen Robert" NAMEID="BH4" ELECTORATE="SA" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Environment" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I presume that if the Labor Party stands by its previous position it would argue that legislation is unnecessary, because it was the Labor Party which assured the Australian people that pastoral leases did in fact extinguish native title. It was so certain of that, in fact, that it was unnecessary to include it within its own legislation. Is the Labor Party coming in here today, now that it has been defeated and is out of office, without having to face up to these responsibilities, and suggesting that we should now do so?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it is not a question of an identity crisis. The identity crisis is on the other side because they have one position in government and another position in opposition. The implication in the question is that perhaps they misled the Australian people on the consequences of the effect of pastoral leases on native title.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that within the Australian community there is uncertainty on this issue <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> at the moment and that that is making life very difficult for many Australians&mdash;no doubt about that at all. Some of that uncertainty may be removed when the Wik case has been concluded, but probably&mdash;as Senator Faulkner, if he knows anything about this matter, will recognise&mdash;not all the uncertainty will be removed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The correct response to this unsatisfactory state of affairs that we have inherited from Labor is something that we are deliberating. If you just wait patiently for a little while longer you will find the answer. But you assured us at the time of debate of that bill that it was not necessary to specifically include it within legislation because of your determination that it did in fact extinguish native title.</PARA></ANSWER>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5K4">Senator FAULKNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. My question was whether you intended to legislate to provide for the extinguishment of native title on pastoral leases. Of course, we had a non&hyphen;answer; it was just equivocation and obfuscation. I ask: will you cave in to the likes of Mr Tuckey and Senator O'Chee or not?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not a question of caving in to anyone. What we said at the time of the election is that there is an uncertain situation left as a result of Labor's failure which we must address and that is exactly what we are doing. There are a number of different alternatives that are open to us. One of the alternatives is to wait until the High Court resolves the matter. As I said to Senator Faulkner&mdash;although I do not think he does understand the consequences of his question&mdash;it may well be that the Wik case will not totally determine that question. I could go into the differences between native title in Queensland and native title in Western Australia, if Senator Faulkner likes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another alternative would be to seek to accelerate other High Court cases that could resolve what questions might be left unanswered. There are a series of potential approaches for us to take to do what we said we would do at the election, and that is act to resolve the uncertainty that currently exists, and we are addressing those options.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UW4">Senator CRANE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator Alston. I ask: what would be the likely impact of the Democrats' proposed environment funding bill&mdash;or should I say taxing bill&mdash;on Telstra, its competitors and Australian consumers? Does this proposal amount to nothing more than a new tax?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="699" SPEAKER="Alston, Sen Richard" NAMEID="LD4" ELECTORATE="VIC" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Communications and the Arts" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Obviously Senator Kernot is very sensitive about this subject, and well she might be. I saw the cartoon on the editorial page of Saturday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  and I am sure the rest of Australia saw it too. The cartoon says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What are you doing?. . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is addressed to Senator Kernot and the answer is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Keeping the bastards dishonest.</PARA>
<PARA>That is precisely what is involved in this proposition. The Democrats say&mdash;and this is the old trick of the money tree at the bottom of the garden&mdash;that you could have a seven per cent tax on Telstra's pre&hyphen;tax profits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first question you would ask yourself is: what are pre-tax profits? When you look at their annual report you see that there is no such thing. There is operating profit before abnormal items of $2.9 billion or operating profit after abnormal items of $2.4 billion. In other words, there is about $500 million to $600 million difference between the two propositions, yet your scheme does not distinguish between the two. Fairly casual economics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us just say you take the higher figure, which gives you $200 million or $210 million a year. That has to come from Telstra's bottom line. So where should it come from, Senator Kernot? Should it come from Telstra cutting back on its infrastructure roll-out program? Should it come from even worse quality service to consumers? Should it come so that it is handicapped in competing with its competitors when it needs new capital investment?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Alternatively, should it simply come from the $200 million worth of welfare initiatives, housing commitments and other areas of budget that are currently funded by that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="700"> contribution? This is precisely the approach Paul Keating took. Whenever he was short of a quid, he went to Telstra with a gun to its head and said, `Give us an extra couple of hundred million dollars.' And you've learnt nothing from it. It clearly is an outrageous way to treat the national carrier as it goes into a new and highly competitive environment. You might like to pretend that somehow it is just going to go on and on with increased profits every year&mdash;18 per cent. That's what you said.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, Mr President. The fact is that last year the increase in operating costs was actually higher than its increase in revenue. So it is in a very parlous position. You should know that they are committed to 30 per cent unit cost reductions over the next two years. I do not know what their chances are of getting that, but on recent experience they are not too good&mdash;certainly not without a lot more community support and cooperation from the union movement. Yet you blithely think you can somehow make one telephone company in a highly competitive environment carry the environment can. In other words, you want them to be the big polluter pays outfit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The way to tackle this issue is the way we have proposed; that is, reduce government debt and at the same time build up a fund that will meet the best environment package in 50 years. You do not simply go around punishing Telstra&mdash;that is what you are doing&mdash;or punishing ordinary&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The statutory presumption against retrospectivity rests upon the well nigh universal conviction that, if members of a community are expected and encouraged, as they are, to govern their conduct by reference to the laws in force in the community, it would be unfair to penalise someone for conduct that was not contrary to the law at the time when he committed himself to it.</PARA></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I'm still puzzling over Senator Collins's question, I have to say. I do welcome the opportunity to tell you about the Surfrider conference held at Bondi Beach a couple of Saturdays ago. This is an important national group of conservationists interested in our coasts and oceans and interested in repairing the damage that has been done by neglect over a long period of time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was a national conference. People came from all over Australia. Of course, having recognised the failure of Labor, they particularly wanted to know what the coalition's plan was in relation to coasts and clean seas.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Five years. This is a large sum of money that could go a long way towards remedying the deficiencies in our coasts and ocean policy at the moment&mdash;your failure, Senator Faulkner, to face up to these responsibilities at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was heartening to note the response of the office-bearers of that particular foundation. No doubt senators, on the other side particularly, saw it as reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun Herald</EMPHASIS> on 12 May when Surfrider executive director, Brad Farmer, said&mdash;I ask the Australian Democrats particularly to note this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the 2000 Olympics on their way, we need to show the world that our coast, our greatest national asset, is being protected. They are not coming to look at our telephones.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>His position is so similar to so many conservationists in Australia now. What they are saying is, `Take the opportunity to be part of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this $1 billion Natural Heritage Trust&mdash;money that can be reinvested in the natural capital of Australia.' In other words, take part of one asset&mdash;that is, part of the capital asset of Telstra&mdash;and reinvest it in another capital asset&mdash;that is, the natural asset of Australia. That is something we would have thought the Democrats and the Greens in this place would regard as a tremendous initiative. We would not have expected it from the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question also gives me the opportunity to remind you that the clean seas and coast policy will address some of the longstanding and very difficult issues relating to our sewerage systems and the pollution of our coast as a result of it&mdash;oil, grease and waste pollution. This will be an opportunity to redesign outfalls to operate more efficiently, to progressively raise the treatment standards, even to tertiary levels where ecological studies show this is necessary, and to develop significant water use, efficiency and effluent reuse. In other words, this is an opportunity to tackle some of the difficult issues that governments have not been able to tackle in the past either because they have not bothered, as in the case of Labor, or alternatively because they have not had a capital base to do it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is why it is so important that the Senate should not miss the opportunity to establish this capital base and do what most conservationists, practically all conservationists, want and what most Australians want&mdash;that is, they want this government to keep its promise and to implement the Natural Heritage Trust and reinvest some of the capital from the partial sale of Telstra in the natural environment of this country.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

Why do we want to do that, Senator Kernot? You may not understand it, but there are still three-quarters of a million Australians in this country who are unemployed as a result of Labor's failure.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Tierney for his question. Mr President, I am concerned, as are providers of services to unemployed Australians, especially young Australians, that at the moment they are being treated like the ball bearing in a pinball machine&mdash;shunted from one place to another. Consider, Mr President, that people in this position need to go to the Commonwealth Employment Service; they need to contact the Department of Social Security; there they may be assessed and sent to contracted case managers who, in turn, might send them to training programs or to skillshare, which will put them on training programs; then they will go back to skillshare or the other contracted case managers; and during all that time they will need to keep in contact with the Department of Social Security and with CES.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="705"> It is not satisfactory that any unemployed Australian can say that we are not giving them value for the money we are spending on them but the outcomes from these programs are not good enough. I have indicated there fore that the cost of some of the programs needs to be looked at in terms of the outcomes. Why? Because that is what people who are unemployed are concerned about. Basically, they want to get an unsubsidised job or a training place in order to enhance their job skills and increase their chances at the next step towards getting a job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we look at the cost of getting someone into a job through providing them with skills that they did not otherwise have&mdash;that is, the net impact cost of these programs&mdash;we find that some of them are very expensive, some more expensive than others, and they have varying outcomes. But it is important that Australians understand what we are spending and that there is an opportunity to reconsider whether we are giving unemployed Australians value for the money we are spending on them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, for someone placed on a jobskills program, you could estimate that the cost of making a net impact in that area was something like $76,575. I do not imagine that the people who participated in that program and who did not get a job think that is value for money and providing a positive outcome. As another example, jobclubs, on net impact, work out at over $6,000, while jobtrain is over $7,000. The more effective programs in this respect are jobstart and skillshare, which are each over $3,000 and moving towards $4,000 for a net impact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The important thing is to look positively at what can be done to redesign what we are doing in this area with a number of objectives in mind. The first objective must be to deliver outcomes to unemployed Australians, not just to satisfy the tactical and political needs of any government at any particular time. The second aspect of any redesign must be that any system designed is comprehensible to young and unemployed Australians, that they are not faced with something like a Hampton Court maze. Thirdly, any redesign of a system must understand the situation of unemployed Australians and try as best as possible to discontinue shunting them from one place to another and treating them as ball bearings in a pinball machine.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the senator for the opportunity to raise the question of the vice&hyphen;chancellors and the response they made to what they understandably see as very bad news. Senator, the very bad news for the vice&hyphen;chancellors, as it is for so many Australians, is that your government left a $8 billion deficit that needs to be repaired.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not at all surprising that no sectors which may have to bear some of the burden that you have left Australia to shoulder receive that news positively. Why would they, when some sectors put so much faith in a Labor government which, in the end, failed to deliver to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I met the vice&hyphen;chancellors last Monday night at a dinner to which I had been invited to speak to them. The message I gave to the vice&hyphen;chancellors is basically this: the serious budgetary problem facing the government was left by the Labor Party&mdash;which basically failed to open the books and let all Australians know the difficult situation we were in prior to the election&mdash;and this government is absolutely determined to resolve the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="706"> I further told the vice&hyphen;chancellors that within my portfolio I had the luckiest people in the community and the unluckiest. The unluckiest are those that your government failed to skill properly. Your government failed to get the economy going enough so that they could get jobs. At the other end, as I told them, I have the luckiest people in the community, the people who are able to par ticipate in higher education&mdash;the people who have the skills and the opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I told them that any approach to resolve the problem left to us&mdash;this enormous black hole left by the previous government&mdash;could reasonably be expected to include the luckiest portion within my portfolio. I told them that we wanted the tertiary education calmly and sensibly to tell us the most rational way to make any savings required from this sector. It think it is fair to say that the vice&hyphen;chancellors did not warm to that task.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of my speech was basically to take that message to them. I have no intention of misleading the higher education sector, as the previous minister did when he said to them, `Nudge&hyphen;nudge, wink&hyphen;wink, we'll give you the money for your pay rise', and then he got rolled in cabinet. There is no benefit in misleading any sector as to the size of the budgetary task faced by this government.

One of the questioners said words to the effect, `Well, I would have preferred to have heard a positive story about what your vision is for higher education.'  We would prefer to be in a position to be able to make that the focus. But the point is that those opposite left us with this serious problem, and that is the problem we must first address.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to Senator Hill, Leader of the Government in the Senate.

Can you inform the Senate as to whether the government's industrial reforms will include an accord with the trade union movement?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, it certainly would not include an accord of the type that Labor had because the Accord, the partnership between the Labor Party and the trade union movement, has cost Australians dearly. Basically, the major problems facing this country of mass unemployment, three&hyphen;quarters of a million people unemployed, plus the debt levels, can be laid at the feet of this partnership arrangement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those opposite have every reason to sit on the other side of this chamber red&hyphen;faced and embarrassed as a result of 13 years of government that have left so many people in a state of misery. It is not only those who are unemployed; it is also those who are underemployed and those who have seen their standard of living fall. That has been the legacy of Labor, Mr President: after 13 years of Labor, the result is so much misery and disappointment. Continually you lifted their hopes and aspirations, only to let them down again, and you did so because of this arrangement with the leadership of the trade union movement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In many ways you let the leadership down as well, and that is what Jenny George is saying. If I can go to the quote, she was asked whether Labor would enter into such an accord again. She said, `I don't think there will be an accord like the one that we had because, at the end of the day, when workers made sacrifices in the national interest, they got no thanks for it'. That is right; you succeeded to the extent of keeping wages down, but you did not give workers jobs. Either you kept them out of work or you kept them poor.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Burns, that was your contribution to the workers of Australia. That was your failure, and that is the reason they threw you out. All of a sudden we have Labor in opposition reflecting on whether or not such accords are a good thing. Former Senator Gareth Evans, your deputy leader, still thinks they are because he is positively talking about another accord. Mr Beazley, your leader, is hesitating; he is moving away. `The quite symbiotic relationship in the Accord policy making process, if you like, disappears', Mr Beazley said. Former Senator McMullan, a pretty smart, astute politician, recognises that not only did you let the workers down but also it was not a politically good policy, so he is moving away from it as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the most appropriate comments came from the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union when its view was reported on 10 May 1996. Of the Accord, it said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We call on the ACTU and the union movement generally to soberly reflect upon the damage caused to the trade union movement over the last 13 years and ensure that there is no repeat of a process which in its effect puts the political survival of the ALP before the industrial interests of workers.</PARA>
<PARA>They recognised that you put the political survival of the Labor Party ahead of the interests of the workers that you claim to represent. You let them down, and that has resulted in mass unemployment and falling living standards in this country, and for that legacy you have been thrown out of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian workers will now have an alternative put to them that will give them hope for the future&mdash;policies that will take the hard decisions and look at expenditure for the first time, not the easy deals with the trade union movement that require workers to make the sacrifices; policies that recognise that workers are entitled to more as productivity rises; policies that are designed to lift productivity and provide benefit for all Australians.

I understand your concern because this action has been obstructed in every possible way by the Strelley Nomads group. ATSIC did provide a response to the Strelley Nomads ombudsman query on 23 April this year and the response refutes allegations of spending on abandoned cattle stations. The only ATSIC funding provided to the Strelley Nomads organisation was for the purpose of community infrastructure, the community development employment project and health funding for those communities living on the five pastoral properties concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Funding for Strelley Nomads has been suspended since July 1993. This decision was <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> made in response to concerns about the level of Aboriginal participation in those community projects administered by Strelley Nomads. Financial concerns in relation to the organisation were not apparent until the undertaking of the 1993 task force review. Accountability requirements had been met by the organisation in the past. The review recommended, amongst other things, that ATSIC engage an independent accountant to undertake a financial audit of Strelley Nomads and that action be taken to recover surplus funds and assets still held by the organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following the completion of the task force review, ATSIC sought advice from the Australian Securities Commission in October 1993 on whether it had powers to investigate ATSIC grant funds transferred to a private company, Nomads Management Pty Ltd.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Duesburys Chartered Accountants was appointed on 24 February 1995 to carry out the independent financial audit.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 9 May, Senator Colston asked me a question in question time concerning a South Australian senator&hyphen;elect. I took the question on notice. Immediately after question time, I advised the Senate that, in respect of Senator Colston's question, I understood that my colleague Senator Vanstone, in her capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Justice, would be replying shortly to a question asked of her by Senator Bolkus a week earlier. That question related to the same matter raised by Senator Colston. I, therefore, advised the Senate that the answer to his question to me would be covered in the answer Senator Vanstone would be providing to Senator Bolkus.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Immediately after I had concluded that statement, Senator Vanstone provided an answer to another question she had taken on notice from Senator Bolkus the previous <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> week. That question had not related in any way to a South Australian senator&hyphen;elect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Later that day, on 9 May, Senator Bolkus put out a media release accusing Senator Vanstone of misleading the Senate and me of unintentionally doing so as a result of Senator Vanstone's actions. An article by Bruce Juddery in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> of 15 May also alleged that Senator Vanstone had caused me to mislead the Senate. The article did not even contain the word `unintentionally'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Vanstone can, of course, speak for herself, as she has done. But I want to reject in the strongest terms that I misled the Senate, either intentionally or unintentionally. It therefore follows that I also reject totally the allegation that Senator Vanstone did anything to cause me to mislead the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my answer to Senator Colston after question time on 9 May, I very carefully and advisedly used the word `shortly' to describe my understanding of when Senator Vanstone would be replying to the question from Senator Bolkus of 1 May. The only persons wanting to make mischief or mislead the Senate would interpret the word `shortly' to mean immediately. I did not know precisely when Senator Vanstone would be responding to the 1 May question from Senator Bolkus. Indeed, I used the word `shortly' after consulting with Senator Vanstone. Neither she nor I saw any implication whatsoever that the word `shortly' meant immediately.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was purely coincidental that immediately after I had given my reply to Senator Colston, Senator Vanstone gave a reply to another of the questions she had taken on notice from Senator Bolkus&mdash;that is, his question of 2 May, a date which she specifically designated. I was not aware that Senator Vanstone was going to give that reply when she did. Even if I had been aware, it would have made no difference whatsoever to the answer I gave Senator Colston because Senator Bolkus's question of 2 May dealt with totally different issues and was asked on a different date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This outburst of righteous, theatrical and mischievous indignation from the opposition was caused by the fact that Senator Bolkus was, once again, caught napping because he had failed to do his homework, which was <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="715"> also the hallmark of his pathetic performance as a minister.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was the second part of Senator Colston's question, Senator Vanstone. What I find quite curious about your answer is that you do answer some specific facts but, despite her not being officially approved for appointment, you do not go to the critical point of whether she spent some time working in the office, which would bring her under section 44 of the constitution, and you do not go to the question of whether she received any rights or benefits and whether she travelled interstate or intrastate in South Australia, which also goes to section 44 of the constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a very close interest in this because when I was elected to the Senate in November 1980 I had to resign the position I held as a backbencher's staffer. I had to resign from the day the writs were issued in 1980. I took up my place in the Senate on 1 July. The issue remains outstanding.

<PARA>Well, I had asked a question on a similar matter last week. I asked it on 1 May, maybe not 2 May. That was the only question I asked about Ferris and Minchin that previous week.

<PARA>I do not know how you understood that, but it is quite clear that you were telling Senator <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="718"> Colston that he was going to get an answer to his question from Senator Vanstone, and, in the context of that answer, that I would be getting one as well.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Short), to a question without notice asked by Senator Cook today, relating to the development import finance facility scheme.</PARA>
<PARA>In question time today, I asked Senator Short a question on the DIFF scheme and the government's intention to abolish it. Once again, I was favoured with another inept performance. We on this side of the chamber have become used to seeing Senator Short rise and look at us like a stunned mullet before he gathers himself to answer a question. When we ask a straight question, we have become used to getting a crooked answer from Senator Short or no answer at all. We got that again today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He said, in answer to a very direct question, that he would not speculate on the budget. He was not asked about the budget. He was asked about an issue that the government itself has put in the public domain that is a matter of considerable commentary in all of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the media that cover business issues and which is a matter of grave importance to Australia's standing in this part of the world. It is a matter that has invited adverse comment or speculation about Australia's role, particularly in Asia, by a number of distinguished Asian ambassadors to this country. This is not a light matter. This is not a matter that can be put aside until several months time, when it might or might not then be answered in a budget context.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I framed this question, unrelated to the budget, to encourage Senator Short to give us a straight answer which would start to quell some of the concerns and speculation going on in the Australian business community about what certainty they had from this government to undertake long&hyphen;term planning and what the situation would be&mdash;such a situation was drawn out in a later question in question time today&mdash;for the 55 Australian companies which have planned and lodged bids and incurred costs should the government go ahead with its announced decision to abolish the DIFF scheme. These are quite fundamental and important questions to commercial Australia and they deserve to be answered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The DIFF scheme gives Australian companies a competitive edge in bidding for infrastructure contracts in developing nations, specifically in Asia. It is a modest scheme by international standards. It is not a generous one, but in the globalised economy in which Australian companies operate, other nations provide schemes of this nature.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Short also declined to indicate that the government had in any way, shape or form conducted any examination of what schemes are provided by other countries to advantage their commercial operators in bidding for these programs at the very time that the Australian government is cutting out the scheme and removing the advantage to Australian companies and thus imposing a considerable handicap on Australian business in being able to win these contracts. What we got by way of answer can only be justified if Senator Short did not know; can only be justified if he was prepared to keep the Australian companies guessing until late <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="719"> August, when their bids are going to be decided in the near future; or can only be justified if it was untruthful. The government has said to the population at large outside this chamber that the DIFF scheme is to be cut. Senator Short would not say inside the chamber what the government has been saying outside it&mdash;that the scheme would go. This is an active public debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind Senator Short, through you Madame Deputy President, that no lesser light than Dick Woolcott, a former head of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade&mdash;and the current Prime Minister's personal emissary in settling matters of a bilateral nature between Australia and Malaysia&mdash;has pleaded publicly with the government to reinstate this scheme or replace it with something that does the same thing. The ambassadors of Indonesia, China, the Philippines and Vietnam have all called on this government not to penalise their countries and to reinstate this scheme. The Queensland industry minister has done the same, and he is a National Party person. The MTIA, BCA and ACCI have all said they want the scheme to continue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By removing this scheme, the Australian government hands a competitive advantage to corporations from Germany, France, Japan and Italy and penalises Australian companies. Therefore, it means that Australians who could get jobs will not get jobs. The removal of the scheme will put in jeopardy the 55 Australian companies who are active bidders now, who have incurred costs currently and who have to repay those costs. Not only is it making a laughing&hyphen;stock of this country in the region, incurring criticism rightfully of this government by those countries; it is undermining our competitive ability. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>Last week Senator Vanstone met with the Australian vice&hyphen;chancellors.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is extraordinarily insulting to Australia's intellectual leaders&mdash;the people that this parliament effectively charges with running our tertiary institutions to produce, we believe, a result that places Australia at the forefront of higher education in the world. The minister, in a jocular and even teasing tone, said, `I could say a figure of five per cent or I could say a figure of 12 per cent.' Then, in reference to proposed budget cuts, she laughingly said, `You should not have heard that.'

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of higher education's contribution to our national exports, vice-chancellors right across the country are saying that this would have a devastating effect on the quality of service provided and on Australia's international reputation, particularly within the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have the minister's departmental head, Sandy Holloway, doing his very best to soothe tempers within the industry at the moment.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What sort of conceptual framework does this minister operate under? It was clear from the answer she tried to give today that she does not have one. The real issue for us as a parliament is whether the $6 billion we expend on this sector is being administered by a government and a minister that really have not faced up to these very fundamental questions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have read the proposals in press right across the country. You cannot say that it is just the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What threat is being posed by these cuts? Quite clearly, as I read it, there is very grave concern right across the sector on this matter and the minister has failed to address these questions. She cannot come here and jocularly or teasingly suggest to us that there is some sort of proposal around that people have misunderstood. It is up to the minister now to give an indication to this parliament of exactly where she stands on these matters.</PARA></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak briefly in relation to Senator Vanstone's answer to a question from the Labor Party, and also a question from Senator Stott Despoja, in relation to higher education. It has been quite clear from information we have received over the last couple of years that there are already crisis situations occurring in Australian tertiary education. One that was widely reported was the perceived shortfall in relation to our research facilities. At the very minimum, $250 million was considered to be required to provide the research infrastructure that is now necessary to have a good standard of research infrastructure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What happens if, first, that is not provided and, second, further funds are taken from the current crisis level of research infrastructure? First of all, it means you become even more <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> dependent on private funding. That means those courses and research that do not attract private funding may go by the board. Certain courses and resources will be cut out. Unless you cut out the funding for research and development, taxpayers will still be paying for research and development. Basically universities will have to run round and round in circles faster to attract research, but the taxpayer will still end up paying for that research even though we have said that it is no longer the responsibility of the taxpayers to fund it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you asked the average person whether or not they thought it was reasonable to pay directly to universities for research&mdash;that is pure research that actually leads to being a clever country&mdash;or whether or not we should pay quite substantial subsidies for companies to then take ownership of that research, they would probably say it is more reasonable for us to directly fund the research. That is the reality. It is a false saving because if we continue to run down our research infrastructure the cost, when we finally realise the damage we have done, will be much greater. If we are looking at long-term scenarios, at the benefits and costs of such expenditure, then we are not saving anything by cutting out the support for good tertiary research facilities in our country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we end up saying that the private sector will have to take that burden more and more, it is still the taxpayer who pays for it, unless you then say, `No, we're going to cut out the research and development funds to the private sector to commission research from the universities.' I think those issues have to be taken into consideration. Have we really saved anything, especially in the medium to long term? What will be the cost when we come to the crunch and realise we have so deteriorated our research and development that the cost in the future will be enormous? What is the actual social and even economic cost of having the private sector dictating what gets research in our institutions even more than it does now? I think these issues have to be taken into consideration before we assume that we save money by pulling resources out of our tertiary sector in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill), to a question without notice asked by Senator Collins today, relating to retrospective legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>I asked Senator Hill a question today relating to the government's position on retrospective legislation. I quoted a statement that the now Prime Minister (Mr Howard) had made in the House of Representatives on this issue. I said accurately that the Prime Minister had said that the coalition parties did not support such legislation. In fact, and I think it was in the same debate, he went on to say that conservative parties were `disdainful' of such legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I quoted a judgment of Mr Justice Wells which, I think, is probably the most quoted judgment in respect of retrospective legislation. I asked Senator Hill to indicate whether the government supported the position that Mr Justice Wells had put in that case. The position Mr Justice Wells put could hardly be more succinctly put than it was.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Hill replied in a very forthright way that he did support the sentiments of Mr Justice Wells when he said, and I quote again:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The statutory presumption against retrospectivity rests upon the well nigh universal conviction that, if members of a community are expected and encouraged, as they are, to govern their conduct by reference to the laws in force in the community, it would be unfair to penalise someone for conduct that was not contrary to the law at the time when he committed himself to it.</PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased and thankful to Senator Hill for his forthright support of Mr Justice Wells's objections to the retrospective effect of legislation which unfairly penalises people or companies for actions they took which were absolutely lawful at the time they took them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are currently three companies in Australia: BHP, Shell and, I mention in particular, Mackay Sugar&mdash;and I am sorry that Senator Boswell left the chamber five minutes ago because I am sure that, if he were here, Senator Boswell would want to rise in this <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> debate and support what I am about to say in respect of Mackay Sugar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">BHP, Shell and Mackay Sugar have all contracted the construction of very large and important vessels to the Australian fleet. I am delighted to say in respect of the Mackay Sugar company that there is a unique vessel&mdash;nothing quite like it in the world&mdash;which will significantly increase Australia's exports of refined sugar; in other words, value added product from Australia. Indeed, it will improve the situation to the extent that additional income to Australians working in that industry will, in fact, be millions of dollars&mdash;millions of dollars&mdash;in additional income to Australia from each and every shipment carried by that ship, which can carry a refined food product and discharge it in either bulk form or bag form. The bagging is actually carried out in the ship itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The carriers from BHP, Shell and Mackay Sugar were all contracted with those grants under the ships grant scheme in place. The government is now proposing to repeal that scheme, not at its legislated end date of 1997 but immediately. This means that those companies&mdash;again, I particularly mention Mackay Sugar&mdash;were contracted to build those very expensive vessels, and they all did so on the basis that those grants would be available to them. For the government to now announce that that scheme, which was not due to expire until 1997, will be immediately repealed, having a retrospective effect on those companies of millions of dollars&mdash;that is, negatively impact on them to the tune of millions of dollars&mdash;is iniquitous. The government, in relation to the very forthright statement that Senator Hill made today about his objections to retrospective legislation, should now carefully reconsider.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The necessity of unanimous support for the joint statement and resolutions made by the Council of Australian Police Ministers on Friday, 10 May 1996 and support for the proposed increase in the Medicare levy to fund the buy&hyphen;back of prohibited firearms.</PARA>
<PARA>I move this motion in the spirit that has characterised the opposition's position on the issue of guns and, particularly in recent days, on the issue of the proposed increase in the Medicare levy to fund the buy&hyphen;back of prohibited firearms. This motion represents a continuation of the position that we took before the election. It also represents a recognition of the need for bipartisan support on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some nine years ago the then Premier of New South Wales, Barry Unsworth, whilst leaving a meeting of ministers discussing gun issues, stated that it would take a manslaughter in Tasmania before we got nationally uniform and effective gun laws. Unfortunately for Australia, for Tasmania, for Port Arthur and particularly for the 35 people and their families who were involved in the tragedy a few weeks ago in Port Arthur, he was right. It has taken such a massacre to force all of us to face our responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those responsibilities should have been faced earlier than this. There were the killings in Hoddle Street, in Queen Street and in Strathfield. This issue should have been addressed by then. Unfortunately, we have essentially had to force reluctant state governments to meet their national and domestic responsibilities. The responsibilities should have been faced by governments in this country over the last few years when the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="730"> former Minister for Justice, Duncan Kerr, was developing an agenda for national uniform legislation to cover guns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This debate has come on in the wake of 35 people being killed at Port Arthur, with the impact that has had on their families. We are also having this debate in recognition of the fact that each year some five and a half thousand Australians die from gun related suicides and one and a half thousand from gun related homicides. Almost 7,000 Australians die in this way each year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have this debate at a time when, gladly, on a national level, all sides of politics have moved on to banning the importation and the use of not just automatic weaponry but also semi&hyphen;automatic weaponry. Both parties decided on the same day, just a few days after the Port Arthur massacre, to ban semi&hyphen;automatic weaponry. It is an important decision because it provides a comprehensive base for giving some effective protection to Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The more recent agenda builds on the one that we were pushing before the election. The bipartisan support for it recognises that what the government is doing is much of what we tried to do. By working together in this parliament, we can shore each other up against a very strong, strident and sometimes quite erratic and dangerous lobby group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Kerr's national laws were to go to a meeting of state ministers in February this year, but that meeting was deferred because of the election. Those laws related to import bans and to a register of firearms. This goes to the core difference on this issue between Labor and the coalition. The coalition wanted a register of those who were too unstable to possess firearms. Gladly, the broader approach has now been taken by the government and the Keating government's proposal for a register of firearms has been embraced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The laws go to all aspects of marketing, ammunition, mail order, qualification and training. It is a very comprehensive agenda. It is a necessary agenda. Together with the buyback scheme and the ban on automatic and semi&hyphen;automatic weaponry, this agenda ensures that, when it comes to protecting Australian citizens from guns, we do not go <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> down the same road as the United States. It is an agenda which is built on the fundamental principle that, in this society, ownership and use of a gun is not a right, it is a privilege. That has underpinned the coalition government's proposals in this area. It was also a core part of the previous government's agenda, as reflected in Kerr's document to state ministers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also argue, in the spirit of bipartisanship that we have been showing on this issue, and that we continue to show, that there needs to be further commitment by government on not just the gun laws and the bans and so on but also on the maintenance of programs that have been put in place to ensure that we can raise the levels of safety awareness and the levels of consciousness against violence of all sorts, domestic and otherwise, in our community. We cannot afford to cut back on the level of funding in this area which has been organised through the access to justice statement and funding quite separate to that. There are quite a number of programs which in a sense we ask the government not to cut back in its ideological bent for savings over the next few months. We need to protect the Safety Australia programs. We need also to maintain our law enforcement agencies, the AFP and the National Crime Authority, and ensure that they get the protection and support necessary. We say to the government that this is something it should continue to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the few moments I have left, it is important for me to focus on the implementation of the scheme. Getting the scheme right is one thing; making it work is another. What is needed to make it work is a degree of monitoring from our level of government. The states have been asked to go off and implement legislation to reflect the agreement they reached with the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), but we have to make sure that is what they do, we have to make sure that the legislation they put in place does not deviate from the proposals agreed to at that meeting some nine or 10 days ago. We need to focus on the laws to make sure they are consistent, and we need to focus on the implementation of those laws to make sure that that is also consistent.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="731">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think an appropriate mechanism we should work through is the Standing Committee of Attorneys&hyphen;General. That committee should be charged with monitoring the implementation. Also, I think it should table in this parliament a report on how and at what pace the states implement the agenda agreed to at a federal level. That committee needs to monitor the exemptions granted under the proposals agreed to by the Prime Minister and state ministers. For instance, we need to get quarterly reports on the number of exemptions in states and in regions to ensure that the spirit, if not the letter, of the agreement reached some 10 days ago is maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a sense these are historical times for us because the level of agreement that was achieved is something that has not been possible for quite some time. Those involved in it from the Prime Minister to other ministers ought to be recognised for their work. I think Duncan Kerr and members on this side of the parliament ought to be recognised for the spirit of bipartisanship which has been important in ensuring one national voice on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said a few minutes ago, we are in this with the government to ensure that bipartisanship gives strength to the national position. Bipartisanship needs to extend across the parliament, and it needs to be voiced by members of this parliament. This bipartisanship basically reflects the voice of the overwhelming majority of Australians who are saying very loudly at the moment, `We have rights too; we have had enough. We need to ensure that we are not pushed around by the gun lobby. We need to ensure that our rights to live in safety and away from the violence of guns can be protected by the parliament.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is with regret that we have to move this motion given the genesis of it a few weeks ago but, from the opposition, I can say that our bipartisanship will continue to be maintained on this issue, despite tricky waters ahead.</PARA>

<TIME.STAMP>(4.27 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, I do not know that I will need all the time that has been made available to me, but I appreciate the opportunity the Senate has to indicate its unanimous support for the joint statement and resolutions made by the Council of Australian Police Ministers on Friday 10 May 1996 and support for the proposed increase in the Medicare levy to fund the buyback of prohibited firearms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also appreciate the spirit in which Senator Bolkus made his remarks on behalf of the opposition. Clearly they reflect the sentiments of the government. I am very pleased in this instance that not only do they reflect a position across the parties within the Australian Parliament but that they reflect a position adopted by both the Commonwealth and the states&mdash;in fact, I think across all parties within the states. So this really is an unprecedented demonstration of public commitment through the elected representatives of the Australian community to address a major social problem that we are facing in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Acting Deputy President, I will reflect for a moment on what was agreed&mdash;the subject of the matter before us in Senator Bolkus's motion&mdash;and use the words from the press statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) of 10 May 1996 after the meeting of the ministerial council that I referred to. We have agreed to prohibit the importation, ownership, sale, resale, transfer, possession, manufacture or use of all military&hyphen;style centre&hyphen;fire rifles including those which substantially duplicate military styles; all other self&hyphen;loading centre&hyphen;fire rifles; all self&hyphen;loading and pump action shotguns; all self&hyphen;loading rim&hyphen;fire rifles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The importation ban is to be effective immediately, and I understand the regulatory requirements for that have in fact been implemented. The exceptions will be a limited range of official or occupational purposes certified by permit, and in practice this would mean primary producers could only have access to low&hyphen;powered, self&hyphen;loading .22s and self&hyphen;loading and pump action shotguns if they <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="732"> can satisfy the police that they have a genuine need for them which cannot be met by any other methods or by any non&hyphen;prohibited weapons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister said also that action would be taken to strictly regulate mail orders, that these prohibitions would be enforced by all jurisdictions as soon as the necessary legislation and regulations are passed and that all jurisdictions have agreed that this will be done as soon as possible. I think the states have already started to implement that. He mentioned that all jurisdictions have also agreed to fair and proper compensation being paid. He said that he would write to premiers and chief ministers regarding that matter, and I understand he has done so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, he said that all firearms will be registered as part of an integrated licensing system and linked nationally and that there will be a comprehensive common approach to licensing which will ensure that only those persons who are fit and proper with a genuine reason and in need of a firearm will have access to one. Stringent storage requirements and compulsory safety training for first time licence applications will be also introduced in all jurisdictions. Finally, he said there would be tight controls on the sale, advertising for sale and transfer of all firearms and ammunition both within and between jurisdictions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A few days later the Prime Minister announced the detail of the funding of the gun buyback system, which is also referred to in the motion Senator Bolkus has put before the chamber today&mdash;that is, the funding of the buyback will be through a one-off increase in the Medicare levy from 1.5 per cent to 1.7 per cent for the income year of 1996-97. That funding has also been supported by all parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is, as I said, unprecedented in the degree of support it has received not only across the political spectrum but also between the Commonwealth and the states. That unanimity arises not only out of the tragic events of Port Arthur but also out of a realisation by the majority of the Australian people that our culture is perhaps being impressed by offshore cultures and it is time to take hold to ensure that we are not heading in a direction that is alien to the values of most Australians.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that the gun culture is a powerful influence. There is no doubt that it has had an impression on some Australians. I hear some, as I have heard some within the last few days, talking about `our right to bear arms' and saying, `How dare they'&mdash;that is, governments&mdash;`interfere with our right to bear arms.' That is not, in my view, a sentiment that is Australian by nature. It is an alien sentiment; it is a foreign culture that is being imported, particularly through the powerful influence of television and other means of mass media.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that we are now taking hold, and we have taken such a dramatic decision Australia-wide, to ensure that we take a stand and limit the further development of this culture will be something for which we will be regarded well by future generations of Australians. What we, jointly across the chamber, have imposed throughout Australia is dramatic and historic. None of us wants to try to make political points as to who led it, who supported it or what was the position of political parties in the past. It is more important now that we stand united, and this motion gives us an opportunity to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In saying this, I recognise that there is another category of Australians who are law abiding but will be disappointed. There are some who may hold these weapons for use in hobbies. There are some who are in various gun clubs. There are certainly many within the rural communities who feel that in the past they have needed weapons of this kind. Some will come within the exemption that I mentioned but others will not. Nevertheless, they are somewhat disappointed because they know they would never breach the law in using their weapons and they feel perhaps an element of Big Brother involved in this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important, and here lies the value of resolutions such as this, to demonstrate to these law-abiding people that we understand that they may feel somewhat frustrated and somewhat disappointed but that nevertheless this decision is in the national good. We, therefore, ask them to constructively be part of it. When they are constructively part of it, we are helped in isolating that very small part of the community which is fighting the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="733"> decision on less fair and genuine grounds. I would give that very small sector of the community very little publicity. They are a very small minority and in recent times they have been given prominence beyond their numbers, which only encourages them. The mass of Australians are totally supportive of what we are seeking to do. Here is a chance for us in the chamber to demonstrate our united support for it as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I applaud the fact that for the first time this is an instance where we are prepared to compensate those who are going to deliver their weapons as part of this national program. It is not an easy decision for any government to impose a new levy, and we are pleased it is being supported by all sides. It demonstrates how genuine we are in seeking to reach a fair and satisfactory outcome in this matter. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to express the wholehearted and strong support of the Australian Democrats for this matter of urgency, moved by the opposition, calling for the unanimous support for the joint statement and resolutions of the special meeting of the Australasian Police Ministers Council and support for the proposed increase in the Medicare levy. On Friday, 10 May 1996, the special meeting of police ministers agreed to prohibit the importation, ownership, sale, resale, transfer, possession, manufacture or use of all military style centre&hyphen;fire rifles, including those which substantially duplicate military styles; all other self&hyphen;loading centre&hyphen;fire rifles; all self&hyphen;loading and pump action shotguns; and all self&hyphen;loading rim&hyphen;fire rifles. They also agreed that the importation ban would be effective immediately.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said before, the Democrats welcome and offer their strong support for these measures contained in the joint statement. We must also state that it is a matter of great regret that it took the horrendous tragedy at Port Arthur to give all our political leaders the backbone to finally take this action and to achieve the historic agreement that actually took place in that meeting of police ministers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats have a long history of pressing for just these measures&mdash;and more&mdash; <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to achieve a national system of gun control. One of our first questions in this debate which has finally led to this action was this: how often do we have to ask for these measures to be taken; this time, will the action be taken? It is indeed pleasing, despite the fact that it was caused by this tragedy, that this action has finally been taken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One ground upon which the action has been taken is that we must try to push back the culture of violence. That violence has reared its ugly head, once again, at many of the meetings that were held in protest against the agreement and against the measures that arose out of it with statements which have been given altogether too much prominence, I feel, in the media and which are unworthy of citizens living in a democracy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the measures that have been agreed upon are useful and are to be welcomed as a first step, the Democrats also believe that they should have gone further. Perhaps they will go further in the future. We believe that gifted, inherited and privately purchased guns should also go through the licence, permit and registration process; that the buyback of guns should cover all guns and not just semi-automatics; that only practising members of genuine gun clubs should be licensed to carry firearms, not people who are simply members of sporting shooters associations, in other words, members of a lobby group; and that the advertising of guns should be banned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also wish to place on record our contempt for those sections of the gun lobby who have incited Australian gun owners to flout the laws of this country and refuse to hand in their arms and, worse, to `spill blood' in defence of their political views. What these people fail to understand is that they further isolate their own cause by carrying on with such reckless campaigning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am confident that the community will continue to reject these extreme views. I am also confident that those parliamentarians in Queensland, in particular, who are being subjected to such pressure will withstand that pressure. I trust that the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) and Senator Boswell will hold firm.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="734">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that the gun lobby is, in fact, overstating its strength and its leverage. At the last election the shooters parties obtained something like one per cent of the vote. They are disregarding the fact that, because all major political parties and all independents agree on these measures, they really do not have a great deal of leverage. I would expect that their words remain just that and that their opposition will not sway members of parliament of any party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should state also that the Democrats are determined that this time we should not fail. But if&mdash;for whatever reason&mdash;it should come to pass that these measures will not be implemented, I would wish to introduce a bill which I have drafted which would initiate a referendum to provide powers to the Commonwealth parliament to legislate on firearms. I trust that it will not be necessary to use that fall back, that reserve, that we have in place, but I will not hesitate to introduce it should it become necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, let me say again that the Democrats welcome this move, this historic agreement by all states and all political parties. I congratulate the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) for having achieved this.</PARA></SPEECH>

I also commend the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) for his compassionate and strong response to the tragedy at Port Arthur.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposal for effective nationwide control of firearms, which emanated from the special meeting of the Australasian Police Ministers Council of 10 May 1996, demonstrates an excellent and strong outcome which I believe is overwhelmingly in the public interest. I commend all those involved in putting together this policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clear from the letters I have received that there is widespread support in the community for urgent and effective action to limit the number of firearms in private hands in Australia. The Greens fully support the government's efforts to ban the importation, sale <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and private ownership of semi-automatic and automatic weapons. It is appropriate for the federal government to use its powers to ban the importation of such guns, even if state governments do not act to ban their sale and ownership. To have state cooperation and uniform measures is a definite bonus. The various actions in the different states, recognising the difficulty with which the states have to approach this matter, are very important. We need to give them the credit so they can involve themselves in the negotiations to bring their state legislation into a state comparable to what is being proposed at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to express the need to control certain types of ammunition, in particular, the hollow point or dumdum ammunition. Basically, this is the ammunition that is designed to do maximum harm. It not only allows a gun to kill but also allows a gun to exert maximum damage when it penetrates a human being. I do not think that those who argue for the use of guns in relation to animals could argue that the hollow point and other kinds of ammunition that are designed for this purpose are justifiable. We have many tragic accidents in our country that support the need to control not only the types of guns available but also the availability of ammunition and the ease of obtaining it. The percentage of killings by guns that occur in the home&mdash;that is, domestically&mdash;is almost near the 80 per cent mark. There is a great need for that control. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

Its unanimous actions arose from the dreadful shootings that occurred at Port Arthur.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="735"> It is very rare for a motion such as this to come before the Senate with not just the unanimous backing of all the political parties in this place and in the House of Representatives, but also unanimous support on a biparti san basis at a state level. I congratulate the stand taken by the new Premier of Tasmania, Mr Rundle, and the state Liberal Party, the stand taken by my state colleagues and the stand taken by the Green members of the House of Assembly in Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Immediately after the shooting the three major parties took a variety of actions on a bipartisan basis on this issue of firearm control in my state. Similarly, at a national level we have had the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, act decisively and immediately, supported by his coalition colleagues Mr Tim Fischer and Mr Anderson; the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley; and the Australian Democrats and the Greens in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I further comment on the actions of the Australian police ministers on Friday, 10 May, I wish to say a few words about the service at Port Arthur on Sunday, at which I was present. I would like to congratulate the people involved in the organisation of that service. Those who were there and those who saw it on the national broadcast on the ABC would agree that it was a very appropriate and moving tribute to those involved in the tragedy that occurred at Port Arthur. Thirty-five people were killed and 18 were injured. It has had an enormous impact on the community of Port Arthur, the Tasmanian community and our national community right throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I spent a lot of my childhood at Port Arthur. The parents of a very close friend of mine owned a small farm just outside Port Arthur. It is really very difficult to understand the events that occurred in that community. It is a small, quiet, close&hyphen;knit community. We witnessed the horror of the devastation that occurred a few weeks ago and the shattering of human lives in that community and it is very difficult to conceive that such an event could occur at Port Arthur&mdash;or, indeed, in Tasmania. As I mentioned earlier, I spent some time there as a boy. I can remember fishing in the bay opposite the Fox and Hound and riding a bicycle to Port Arthur. You really wonder how events such as the one we are discussing today can occur in such a community in Tasmania.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After the service on Sunday, I spent some time just walking around the ruins of Port Arthur and reflecting on the shootings that had occurred. It is very hard to comprehend how such an event, in which 35 people were killed, can occur in this country. I would like to pay a tribute to all those involved in the service on Sunday, including the Premier of Tasmania, Mr Rundle, the local mayor of the Tasman Peninsula, Mr Noye, and a number of others who made very appropriate and very moving tributes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to publicly congratulate all of those involved on the day of the shooting and its aftermath&mdash;all of the emergency service workers: the police, the ambulance, the emergency service personnel. I pay tribute to the way in which the local personnel involved handled the various issues. I also pay a special tribute to the actions of the staff at the hospital in Hobart. They were, unfortunately, subjected to some very unfair criticism after the shootings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> As I have said earlier, you have to wonder, knowing the Port Arthur community and Tasmania as I do, how such a dreadful event can occur. Arising out of this dreadful human tragedy at Port Arthur, the Prime Minister, the other leaders of the coalition and the Leader of the Opposition, who offered bipartisan support, acted very quickly and decisively in convening the Australasian Police Ministers Council on Friday, 10 May.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The gun debate is not a new debate. It is one that has gone on in our community as long as I have been in public life. We are fortunate to have had the effective bipartisan leadership, at both a state level and a national level, to act quickly and decisively after the events at Port Arthur. I certainly hope that the very strong commitments that have been made and the action that has been foreshadowed by the state parliaments around Australia will be acted on in order to avoid another tragedy like that which occurred at Port Arthur. I think that is absolutely critical when we look at the history of the gun control debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had a number of terrible tragedies in this country in recent years: seven people shot in Melbourne in 1987, the Hoddle Street killings as that shooting became known; eight <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="736"> people killed in Melbourne in Queen Street; five people shot in Surry Hills, Sydney; six people shot in the Strathfield Shopping Plaza in Sydney; six people shot on the central coast of New South Wales; three people shot in the inner west of Sydney; three members of one family knifed to death in Brisbane; seven people shot dead in a murder&hyphen;suicide in a Brisbane suburb in January of this year. These dreadful events are events that have occurred in just the last 10 years. As I have said, we are very fortunate to have had decisive and swift action by our national legislators, led by the Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said at the commencement of my contribution to this debate, it is a rare occasion when we do come together nationally, in a bipartisan way, in support of a range of proposals to limit the ownership and use of firearms in this country. We believe the proposed increase in the Medicare levy is an effective and fair way of dealing with the costs of the buyback of the prohibited firearms. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Bolkus has presented the Senate with a motion that is quite obvious and has the support of all sections of the parliament. I rise on behalf of the National Party to signal my support for the motion. It is a tragedy beyond belief that 35 people lost their lives in terrible circumstances at Port Arthur, though it has led to a unified approach to gun control measures in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Subsequent to that terrible event&mdash;I do not know any words to describe it other than `terrible' or `horrific'&mdash;on Friday, 10 May, the police ministers from all states and territories met with the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) to discuss and coordinate an approach that would have the universal support of the states. The resolution included the prohibition of importation and ownership, sale, resale transfer of possession, manufacture and use of all military style, centre&hyphen;fire rifles. There is almost universal acceptance that there is no need or reason to have any assault-style rifles or automatic rifles in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australia. That would be the belief and the understanding that I have had.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All other self&hyphen;loading rifles were put on the prohibited list. All self&hyphen;loading pump action shotguns, all self&hyphen;loading rim&hyphen;fire rifles and all firearms will come under a registration system that will be interconnected with a police computer and linked with a national exchange of police information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This matter has been the subject of great debate in Australia. There has been a lot of consternation amongst law&hyphen;abiding citizens who feel fairly hurt that they are being singled out and branded as criminals. Those people that have had guns for years are the ones that are making the biggest sacrifice of all. To some people it is part of their way of life to own a gun, and yet they are going to be the ones that have to surrender their guns, albeit with a compensation for them. It is hard for people to make the sacrifices who believe that they have never done anything wrong, have always been law&hyphen;abiding and have always treated and used their guns in the utmost safety.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, all parties are supporting the proposed legislation because it is believed to be in the best interests of society. The Premier of Queensland, Rob Borbidge, and the police minister, Mr Cooper, have supported a universal approach to gun registration and gun licensing. There is no doubt that the fairest way to effect the buyback is to increase the Medicare levy from 1.5 per cent of a weekly wage to 1.7 per cent, costing the average working family $1.40 per week and increasing in proportion to incomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Across the political spectrum from Right to Left, it is probably the Right, the people that I represent, who have made the sacrifices. I do not argue about that. I feel sorry for those people as they have to surrender the guns but I do not think we ought to let this matter go halfway. If those on the Right of the political spectrum, the National and the Liberal parties&mdash;and you, Mr Acting Deputy President, represent rural South Australia&mdash;have made these sacrifices, then I believe that the Left of the political spectrum also has to make sacrifices.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="737">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can no longer have videos that depict violence. We can no longer have violent movies because, if we are all going to make sacrifices, it has got to be right across the political spectrum. The full responsibility cannot be put on gun owners. They are prepared to wear it and will reluctantly surrender their guns when they have to, albeit with a lot of doubt, because they are law&hyphen;abiding citizens but let us not just leave it there; let us complete the job. Let us put as much focus on videos, violent movies and violence as we have on gun registration and the removal of guns. If we adopt a thorough approach, we have a chance of solving the problem. But if we just leave it to one section of the community to carry the burden, then we are not going to solve the problem. The Right of the political spectrum has made the sacrifices but the Left also has to meet its commitments.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the motion, and I commend the government on its very quick action to introduce strict, uniform gun laws and the buyback scheme. I am certainly proud to be part of the Labor Party, which has a commendable record of seeking uniform gun laws. What used to be a glimmer of bipartisanship has now, as a result of the tragedy in Port Arthur, turned into a blinding flash. It is very pleasing to see that the Prime Minister of this country has responded very smartly to public opinion on this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today I wish to focus my contribution away from gun law reform specifically and look at the issue of public health. As a public health measure, strict gun control laws are essential. Any government or politician vacillating on this issue effectively abrogates their responsibility to their community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Some people have advocated the establishment of a dangerous persons' register as an acceptable form of gun control instead of a national register of firearms. The fact is, however, that this course of action will not stop homicides. The record of gun violence in Australia clearly shows that very few incidences of violence are committed by people with a history of dangerous behaviour, and 86 per cent of victims in mass killings were report edly killed by a person with no reported history of violent crime or mental illness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sad facts are that seemingly law abiding citizens or members of their families are the ones who take their own lives or the lives of those around them. In Australia over a four&hyphen;year period, between 1989 and 1993, 532 Australian women were killed. Fifty per cent of these women were killed in domestic violence situations and one-third of these women was killed by firearms. This figure does not include the number of children killed, but in many instances the lives of children were lost as well. Research shows also that many people commit violence with guns they do not own but which are easily accessible to them. You have to accept this as a contributing factor to the high number of unfortunately successful suicides in rural areas, particularly amongst young men.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just last week, the National Rural Health Alliance, a body with the support of 18 national bodies representing rural health professionals, country women and other rural health consumers, entered the debate in support of stricter national gun laws. This alliance has the health of rural Australians as their first priority. They quote data that shows that amongst  males between 15 and 24 years of age in country towns the rate of suicide increased 12-fold since 1964. That compares with a threefold increase overall for all males. Evidence shows that half of these suicides were associated directly with firearms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The common theme in statistics on gun related suicide, domestic violence and other homicides is the accessibility of the firearm. It is the accessibility of the gun that creates the danger, hence the importance of the introduction of these new gun laws to try and stop this violence occurring. The overwhelming majority of gun homicides are by family members, friends and acquaintances. Research also shows that the presence of guns in the house increases the risk of both suicide and homicide by a family member or an intimate acquaintance in that home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The National Committee on Violence, established after the Hoddle and Queen Street massacres, concluded that the majority of gun homicides are unplanned and impulsive and, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="738"> indeed, may not have occurred if that lethal weapon was not available. The availability of that firearm, so the committee said, made death a far greater likelihood.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Governments legislate for a variety of measures for the sake of a safe and healthy community. There are few people who would argue with this function of government. If gun related homicide were an infectious disease, there would be a national register of carriers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 10 May, while police ministers were gathering here in Parliament House to discuss gun law reform, I was privileged to speak at a rally in support of national gun laws organised by Wesnet, Women who work in Emergency Services Network. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry that Senator Lundy's time expired, because I was very interested in the things she had to say. I do welcome the opportunity, which is rare enough in this place, to have such bipartisan&mdash;or tripartisan or multipartisan&mdash;support for an urgency motion. As a Tasmanian, it has been a great source of comfort to see the way political parties have put aside their differences right around the country, as well as in my home state of Tasmania, to tackle this terrible problem that Australia is facing with the growth in violence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have always thought of our home state as being a peaceful and safe community, rather free from the troubles of the rest of the world, and very precious to us as a result. We thought of it as the last place one would expect to find a massacre so horrific and so tragic. Initially, there was just disbelief that it could have happened to us. That horror came to us through the barrel of a gun. The shots that were fired at Port Arthur that afternoon have changed Tasmania and, I think, its people forever. We have been very deeply scarred. There is hardly a person on the island who hasn't been touched in some way, however remote, by the tragedy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday, several thousand people went to the Port Arthur historic site for the memorial service. It was a difficult thing to do, to revisit the site that is so awesome and so <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> dreadful. In the week after the massacre, services were held in each of our major cities and towns. A minute's silence was observed at 10.30 a.m. on 1 May. Shop assistants and office workers stood silently on the footpaths outside their workplaces. Cars pulled over to the side of the road. Hundreds of people attended church services to remember and pray for those killed and injured.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This has given us hope, however. It is hope that we can do something to prevent this ever happening again&mdash;in Tasmania or anywhere else in Australia. The wonderful thing is that people have grabbed that hope with their hands and run with it. That is why the action that was initiated by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and supported so widely around the country at the political level and at the level of the people&mdash;that is, in getting the various police ministers together and in having decisions made&mdash;is so important to us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new gun controls agreed to by the police ministers are just the important first step towards a safer Australian community. They will help us to take those high powered weapons of destruction out of the community. They will help us to prevent more Australians being killed and injured by guns. Senator Lundy went through some very worrying statistics about who is being killed with guns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that there are many gun owners who feel they have been unfairly penalised for the actions of one person. They are concerned that their rights and freedoms are being infringed. There is no doubt that it will impinge on the rights of individual gun owners. The Prime Minister has acknowledged that. He spoke of his regret at that, but what right is more important? An individual's right to own a semi-automatic or automatic weapon or the right of the rest of us to live safe from those guns? In the case of primary producers and other rural dwellers&mdash;that applies to people in Tasmania just as much as in Queensland, Western Australia or the Northern Territory&mdash;there is room in the new laws for their special needs to be met.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have responsibility for assisting the Prime Minister on issues related to the status of women. I have found it most fascinating and really very pleasing that over these last three <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="739"> weeks women throughout Australia have been very strong in endorsing the measures that have been taken by the political parties about gun control. Obviously not every woman believes it is right, but there are a lot of women very much happier that this action has been taken and they want other measures to be taken too, relating to domestic violence and to videos, films and computer games which encourage people to think of women as victims in sexual violence matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are concerned about all those issues as a society and rightly so. If there has been one good thing, apart from the gun control, that has come out of this massacre, it is that this society is at last prepared to focus on violence. It is no longer just politicians talking; it is the whole community. I am glad to hear people in the entertainment industry, and the media industry generally, are prepared to countenance that somehow people can become addicted to violence, that they can be affected by what they see on television and videos, et cetera. If you can sell more ice&hyphen;cream by advertising it on television, why can't you condition people to the concept of violence?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I made a speech in this place a few years ago in which I read into the record some of the dreadful copycat crimes that had taken place in Victoria against women. The then justice minister, Senator Tate, urged me to stop because we were on the air and people could hear what was being said. The trouble is a lot of people have not known what sort of violence is being encouraged by some of these videos. It was, I thought, only by reading that into the public record that people would understand just how dreadful some of the violent material is that is made available to people in our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Women's experience of violence is most likely to be at the hands of a man known to them. Guns are used by perpetrators of domestic violence to both threaten and harm women and children, as Senator Lundy has said. I will not go through those statistics because she has already done that very tellingly. But women's groups have called on governments for many years to take a strong stand against all forms of  violence. We have <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> promised in our election commitments to have a national summit on violence. The Office of the Status of Women is working to that end right now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a national study being done by the Bureau of Statistics to give us comprehensive national data. It will be the first baseline national data on the incidents of violence against women and the results are expected to be available in December this year. We hope to have a national summit drawing in the states to help us so that further action can be taken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will finish by quoting the head of the medical services at the Hobart hospital. Dr Brian Walpole said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our innocence was violated and we have become yet another statistic on the international firearm catastrophe toll. Our home may never be the same again.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>In doing so, I ask the Senate to note in particular the accompanying brochure, which is included in the front part of the report, which gives an overview of not only the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="740"> background and methodology but also the audit findings and recommendations to which I wish to draw particular attention. This is an auditor's view of the process of virtually the contracting out of a number of DEET activities. As such, I think the audit findings and recommendations need to be looked at very carefully. This is about Public Service agencies purchasing goods and services but, in particular, it is about purchasing the services which were previously provided by the department itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the auditor's findings and recommendations, we see that there was not a framework in place that would allow the department to assess whether it was achieving value for money. In other words, the contracting out theory was followed, the currently favoured economic direction was followed, without there being in place any way of assessing whether it was any good. I think this is a damning indictment of that very theory because it demonstrates that this particular department is unable to evaluate that. Without a framework in place, how on earth could any sensible assessment be made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some howevers and buts about this and there is some recognition of progress. The auditor does note that progress has been made, and rightly so. As is usual with the  auditor, objectivity is brought to this assessment and the auditor is able to recognise that progress. I want to emphasise the inadequacies of the processes which still exist. I refer the Senate to page 20 of this report. Point 5.11 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In some cases the Departmental draft standard form contract was used.</PARA>
<PARA>That is to be acknowledged. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, in the majority of outlets the ANAO found that the contracts did not conform with either the Department's general guidelines for Labour Market Programs or the draft standard contract. Where the draft standard contract was not used, the contracts were generally of the short form type, containing insufficient detail as to the Department's requirements and/or the trainer's obligation.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>With that in mind, one would surely be tempted to ask questions. What happened? Was it successful? Did it meet the needs of either the department or the community at <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> large? How do we know whether it was successful or not? The comment of the audit office in 5.13 reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ANAO considers that there would be benefit in monitoring the use of contracts to ensure that they align with Departmental guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA>So there would be benefit. I would have thought that would be fairly obvious to all concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to the Senate that really it is about time the mythology of contracting out as a suitable way of conducting government service was exposed, and I believe it is exposed in this report. This is not a five-minute wonder that the ANAO conducted. This is an objective, timely and well-conducted investigation. It has revealed the fallacy of this mythology that contracting out is by definition the way to go, the way to provide services to the community. As DEET is one of the large providers of services to the community, I think it is timely that we have an exposure of the inadequacies of the theory when compared to the actual practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a lot of stuff pushed to us through the media about competitive price tendering and open tendering and all that sort of business. We are told so often that we need to look at the outcomes of various government processes. Here we have a revelation of the outcomes. We have no mechanism in many cases of comparing what it is that was asked for and what it is that was delivered. We have no coherent process of evaluation. Because of that, how on earth can a judgment be made about the success or otherwise of this contracting out process?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I thoroughly recommend that a proper examination be made of this report and that people take note of what is being said here. It is no idle comment that is being made by the auditor; it is no baseless comment that is being made by the auditor. Here are the facts that reveal what is wrong with this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I speak with some experience in this matter not only as a person who is interested in the educational field, which has been my direct interest as well as my professional interest over a number of years, but also as a person who at one stage&mdash;for the benefit of those Tasmanian senators who may be interested in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="741"> this&mdash;worked for the Tasmanian Department of Construction, which at various stages was associated with the Department of Main Roads, the Department of Public Works, Works Tasmania and various other names and identities. If one travels in Tasmania at the moment, one sees the result of this theory of contracting out being the best way to conduct the provision of goods and services to the taxpayer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The result is that many of the major roads that one travels on are having to be rebuilt because the original theory was adopted without sufficient regard being paid to a measurement of the outcomes. In other words, the monitoring of what was provided, the examination of the quality of the service or the goods that are provided, was not in place. This is what the auditor is saying in this report: if you are to have these new fancy ideas, then you had better find a way of monitoring them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Tasmania, in the instances that I spoke of, on several of our major roads there was no capacity left in the department to examine what it was that taxpayers got for their money. It was contracted out all right, but it was not monitored and evaluated and the quality was not there. Now the taxpayer is having to fund the rebuilding of those very roads. This is at a not insignificant cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wonder, with all the money that is spent through this department&mdash;the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs&mdash;at what cost these unevaluated, unmonitored and ill-conceived contracts will need to be repaired or replaced in the future. I do not give an unequivocal criticism of the department in this. The auditor rightly points out that there have been some improvements made, but it is within the capacity of the department to bring greater uniformity to the form of contracts and the type of evaluation which is brought to those and the measurement of what it is that is being received for the money that is paid out by the taxpayer.</PARA></SPEECH>

I support the remarks of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Senator Bell and the tremendous concerns about the administration, yet again, of programs under the former Labor government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are here today dealing with a report from DEET. DEET has an annual budget of $11 billion, and several billion of this is spent on a number of labour market programs to assist the long-term unemployed and disadvantaged job seekers. Much of the money is spent in two broad categories: specially contracted courses for a number of participants and individual places that are purchased in established courses. The audit examined whether these training services purchased by DEETYA for labour market programs provided value for taxpayers' money. This audit places a very considerable question mark over the matter of providing value for money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will quote directly from the report some very disturbing findings. For example, at the time of the audit, field work was undertaken, and the ANAO found that there was not a framework in place which would allow the department to assess whether it was achieving value for money. The audit raised practices about a number of matters, including the assessment of contracted courses, the tender selection process, advanced payments made to providers, and course monitoring and evaluation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At page 12 of the report, assessments are made about the conduct and value of contracted training courses. The ANAO found that the quality of these assessments varied enormously. It took over two years to establish formal area consultative committees and ESL and literacy groups. Other common problems noted included those such as a lack of documentary evidence in support of course assessments. Justifications were often brief, consisting only of a few words such as `good opportunity' or `vacancy demand', which did not provide much assistance or insight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At page 13 of the report the provision of established course placements for clients is noted as showing problems with value for money assessment. The points noted include:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. client statements in support of their application were often not supported by the necessary documentation; however, some courses were still approved; <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="742"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. in some offices assessments were not carried out because it was claimed there were insufficient time and resources, or were only conducted when the course was unfamiliar or likely outcomes not known;&hyphen;</PARA>
<PARA>If we turn to the actual tender selection process, at page 19 the report shows further inadequacies:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ANOA found that registers of training providers were used in all nine Areas visited during the audit. However, in only one of the nine Areas did the register contain sufficient information to indicate that pre&hyphen;screening, using the provider selection criteria, had actually been carried out.</PARA>
<PARA>On the matter of advance payments to providers, the tendering guidelines for labor market programs state that advance payments should only be made when there is a cost saving to the department. Yet, on page 21, the report reveals that, despite the guidelines, the ANAO generally found that advance payments were scheduled in 80 per cent of cases and only 20 per cent were done on acquittals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report also notes some irregularities in the course monitoring and evaluation procedures. At page 22 it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The guidelines require regular monitoring to be carried out throughout the course and should involve visits wherever possible. . . Despite the greater emphasis on monitoring, the ANAO found that the level of monitoring varied between CES offices.</PARA>
<PARA>While monitoring of contracted courses was carried out in the majority of CES offices visited, it went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By contrast, monitoring of established courses was not well entrenched and in a number of offices the ANAO found that there was no monitoring of established courses at all.</PARA>
<PARA>Thankfully, the ANAO report does note that, since this field audit, the department has made significant efforts to establish an appropriate framework to protect the taxpayers' interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Well, gee, it would want to after that report, which I consider a damning one. In a whole range of areas in the administration of these programs you have virtually no oversight of what is happening out there and no oversight of the way in which the expenditure of government money is acquitted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ANAO concluded, finally, that there was no real guidance as to whether the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government was getting value for money. Fairly obviously, on the basis of this report, they had to reform their procedures. They have started to do so, but there is no sign that they have completed this task&mdash;and they still have a long way to go. What the Senate should be doing is keeping a very careful eye on this process over the next few months to make sure that proper procedures are put in place so we can ensure that the government is getting value for money in the area of education.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Auditor&hyphen;General's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report No. 23</EMPHASIS> , <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Procurement of Training Services</EMPHASIS> . Those who follow the Senate estimates process will know that I have asked a number of questions in relation to DEETYA programs, in particular on case management and training programs, and about the outcomes of those training programs. Unfortunately, until now the responses from DEETYA have been that they do not have much of an idea about what part of their expenditure is working and what part is not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to see that some impetus has perhaps been created by the Audit Office report to push that along, so that DEETYA is looking at outcomes, at whether or not it is meeting those outcomes, at what courses are actually leading to employment, and what courses are perhaps simply making work resulting in people going round and round in circles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there are a number of issues here, apart from the impacts of the privatisation of training. One of those issues is that during debates such as the one on the youth training allowance that we have had in the Senate, it was brought to light that you needed to have an effective consultation with the unemployed to be able to place them in courses that were actually going to get them somewhere and lead them to a meaningful job. Firstly, there needed to be some interest by the client&mdash;the unemployed person&mdash;and, secondly, the course needed to lead them to somewhere where they thought they wanted to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, in that debate we did not get any agreement in this chamber that the people who were the clients&mdash;the unemployed, and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="743"> especially youth unemployed&mdash;had any rights at all to an actual negotiation of the agreements they signed, including agreements to attend a training course even if it might require them to take two buses and 90 minutes a day to get there. There was no real agreement per se because a contract was given to the unemployed person and they had to sign it. There might have been a cooling&hyphen;down period, but they still had to sign it after several days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part of the problem is certainly whether or not the courses are appropriate. But it is also whether or not the people who are required to take those courses actually feel that they are appropriate to their needs and desires. Surely, a basic mechanism for someone taking a course is that they want to do it and they feel it is leading them somewhere. No matter how good the course is, if people have taken no real part in the agreement for them to take part in that course, they are not going to get a great amount out of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I spoke to a person in Perth who provides training services for DEETYA. That person said, `I've got a bone to pick with you. The government told me that you are responsible for us having to do an audit every year.' I am glad to see that the Audit Office has said that the documentation requirements will be simplified. It seems ridiculous that people should use the Greens, and other people who ask questions about training, as a rationale for saying that course providers should have to be audited every single time they provide a course for DEETYA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly, course providers should be accountable; certainly, their books should be open and they should be available for spot auditing. But it should not be used as an excuse for auditing providers every single time they provide a course. They should obviously have to provide their books and acquit the amount of money that has been given to them. But to audit them every year seems that you are actually providing a great disincentive for people to be involved if they have already been cleared and audited once and could perhaps be down as a preferred provider.  </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All in all, this Audit Office report only touches the surface because they have really only asked themselves to look at the procurement of training services, not the outcomes in general. There is a much bigger issue here. We should look closely at DEETYA. I am not suggesting that the funds provided to DEETYA are sufficient. But I am suggesting that we make sure that we are outcome oriented&mdash;and part of that means involving the clients in decision making about whether the courses they are asked to go on will lead them in the direction they would like to go.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the order of the Senate of 29 November 1994, relating to the consideration of legislation, not apply to the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill 1996.</PARA>
<PARA>This motion is about whether the Senate, and more particularly the government, should be entitled to get on with the business of governing. If anything was crystal clear during the last election campaign it was that we had a very specific and controversial proposal for the partial privatisation of Telstra. No&hyphen;one was in any doubt about the implications of that issue. We certainly did not get too much support from a number of quarters but everyone knew precisely what they were voting for when they voted for us&mdash;and they did, overwhelmingly.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you blokes are serious about your logic, if you want to maintain the proposition that somehow a substantial section of the community was against this proposal to a passionate extent, all that tells you is that if we had not run on that particular proposal you would hardly have won a seat in the Senate, let alone the House of Representatives. It is absolute nonsense to suggest that we did not have overwhelming support for this proposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We must, therefore, have regard to the processes that should be followed in this place.

In other words, just standing logic on its head, there was no coherent response to the proposal that we put.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every score, whether it is consumer protection, foreign ownership, the sale process or consumer safeguards, is covered. This is the best package that you could ever look for when it comes to privatisation. Best of all, we are not just putting the money in the back pocket and throwing it around at whiteboards when the election comes along. We are actually spelling out what we are going to do with it: retire government debt, fund the greatest environment proposal in 50 years and do something constructive&mdash;get Telstra into shape.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra knows it needs to lift its game. That is perfectly clear. But it is not going to do it with your sort of mindless union vetoes on any constructive change. You are depriving not only the Australian community of the opportunity to invest but also Telstra employees. I can assure you that they would be very keen to invest, just as they were in the UK. Do you know what happened back in 1984? The union membership of British Telecom recommended a total boycott of the sale process. They did not believe in privatisation, so they told the union members not to touch it. Do you know what the take&hyphen;up rate was? It was 97 per cent. They all did very nicely because they all knew that it was good value.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What Senator Alston managed to achieve in his speech was to highlight the absolute procedural mess that the government finds itself in in relation to this issue. The Senate is being asked to deal with the Telstra bill as its first item of legislation today. Of course, this bill is caught in the coalition's own cut&hyphen;off motion. It is caught in Senator Hill's own order of continuing effect that prevents debate on this bill in this sittings. It prevents debate until the next sittings of the parliament. This motion was enthusiastically presented to the Senate by Senate Hill and the then coalition in opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, we have a government proposal on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> to amend the order of continuing effect, the cut&hyphen;off motion, to enable debate on bills that are introduced in the first two&hyphen;thirds of the sittings. This is another matter that the Senate is still to decide a position on. In the meantime, while these matters are left up in the air, we now have a proposal to dragoon us into allowing an exemption for the Telstra bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his speech, Senator Alston raised the issue of the possible referral of this bill to a Senate committee. This is another issue that the Senate still has to deliberate on and determine a position on. I understand that this matter was considered at the last meeting of the Selection of Bills Committee and that the issue was deferred. The government is yet to convene another meeting of the committee to resolve this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is my intention to resolve the confusion in relation to this debate that has been wrought by the government by moving an amendment to Senator Alston's motion. I am happy, if it is the wish of the Senate, to have the amendment circulated in the chamber. If senators prefer, I would be happy to read it out but the usual process is just to have a copy of this amendment circulated in the chamber. Essentially, what the opposition is proposing is to refer the bill to the Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts References Committee for inquiry, according to the terms of reference that are before the Senate, and for report by 22 <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="751"> August, in the first week of the next sittings period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill does raise very important issues that I do think deserve to be debated in a much more sensible and cogent way than was the case with Senator Alston's rather extraordinary contribution on this matter a few moments ago. It does not only raise the important issue of telecommunications policy but the issues of privatisation, of deregulation, of foreign ownership and of the future of public ownership of our national assets. It is, I think, a bill which really does have far&hyphen;reaching consequences for economic management and far&hyphen;reaching consequences for public policy in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has argued&mdash;not very effectively, but Senator Alston did argue&mdash;that there has already been adequate public debate on this issue; that there has been adequate public debate on the merits of the government's proposal; and also, of course, that the government has a mandate to implement the partial privatisation of Telstra. The opposition certainly questions these assertions. John Howard in fact pulled the Telstra&hyphen;environment policy out of his sleeve only four weeks before the last election. It was part of what could only be described as a bewildering array of policy commitments that the coalition deliberately kept from the electorate until the final weeks of the election campaign. You might ask, Mr Acting Deputy President, why this was their approach. Of course, it was to maximise their impact but minimise the opportunities for public scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I agree with those who have said that we have not had adequate debate on the Telstra sale proposal. I might also say that we have not had adequate parliamentary debate on the Telstra sale proposal. It is clear that the government does not want either adequate debate or adequate parliamentary debate on this proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all saw how this bill was gagged in the House of Representatives on the last day of the last sittings period, in order, apparently, to speed its way through parliament. I might say this does send a very clear message on the coalition government's real commitment to the sanctity of parliamentary scrutiny, on <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which we have heard a great deal of baseless rhetoric from the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then, before the parliamentary session we had from Senator Hill an outrageous memo threatening to keep the Senate sitting through the recess unless we agree to rush this bill through the Senate&mdash;and, for that matter, the Workplace Relations Bill as well. This memo was circulated&mdash;extraordinarily enough&mdash;before either of these pieces of legislation had been introduced into either House of the Australian Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apparently, the same level of concern does not go to the issue of the promised $1 billion environment fund. In an absolutely extraordinary article in this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, by national affairs correspondent Laura Tingle, we find that Senator Hill has said, `We don't want to clog up our own program with bills that aren't essential.' What bill could he possibly be referring to? He was actually referring to the coalition's natural heritage trust bill&mdash;the bill that we have heard for ages had an absolutely symbiotic relationship with the partial sale of Telstra; the bill that had an absolutely unbreakable link with the partial privatisation of Telstra. Yet this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> quotes Senator Hill as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We don't want to clog up our own program with Bills that aren't essential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We can't allow ourselves to be manoeuvred into a situation where we spend the next three weeks debating the natural heritage Bill, which we don't have to get passed this session, and not the Telstra bill, which we do.</PARA>
<PARA>It is really a most extraordinary admission from Senator Hill in relation to what the real priorities of this government are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I heard Senator Alston's couple of comments on mandate in an interesting conversation he was having across the chamber with Senator Schacht. I would have thought that the government should treat this issue as a serious matter. No doubt you will get a wrap over the knuckles, Senator Alston, when you go back to the executive wing, after that particular performance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a couple of observations that I would like to make on the issue of mandate. The first is that the government is very selective and very self-serving about its <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="752"> interpretation of its own mandate. It is an extraordinary interpretation, really. You would probably think that, if it has a mandate to sell Telstra because it made a commitment to do so during the election campaign, it would perhaps also have a mandate to maintain funding for the higher education sector. We have heard a great deal about that over recent days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps you have a mandate to maintain the export market development grants scheme in its present form. Perhaps you have a mandate to limit public service cuts to around the 2,500 voluntary terminations you spoke about during the election campaign. Perhaps you have a mandate to maintain the real value of labour market programs. So it goes on. This is a very selective interpretation of your mandate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As each and every day passes, we have a new discovery&mdash;including in question time today&mdash;about how those commitments and a range of other commitments obviously fall into a very different category from the commitment made in relation to selling Telstra and the commitment that the coalition made to end 13 years of industrial harmony in this country. Perhaps all these other matters that I speak of are matters that the government considers it has a mandate for but does not choose to exercise its mandate in respect of those particular issues of public policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be very interesting to hear during this debate how the government interprets its mandate. I really will be looking forward to you enlightening not only the opposition and minor parties in the Senate but also the Australian people about your current interpretation of your mandate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might also say that John Howard&mdash;now Prime Minister&mdash;when in opposition in 1987 said this about mandate. Let me quote his words exactly:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that the best way of ensuring that this bill receives proper scrutiny is to refer it to a Senate committee for very thorough scrutiny and examination. The committee of inquiry should allow for public submissions and they should be invited by advertisement. In order to enable the many Australians with an interest in this proposal to participate in the inquiry and have their views heard, we believe that this committee should hold hearings around Australia. We do not believe that such an inquiry can be concluded before August, in less than three months. That is why we are proposing a reporting date of 22 August.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All I can say is: what a farce! The first thing that Senator Faulkner did when this parliament <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="754"> resumed was to move an amendment to the motion of the address-in-reply to the Governor-General's speech to the effect that the opposition would vote against the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill. In fact, he went on television the previous night to say that the Labor Party will vote against the Telstra bill. That is the position of the Labor Party. They said that they will vote against it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats have said all along that they will vote the bill down. They will not have a bar of it. Senator Kernot has said time and again, `Whatever the argument that is put before us, we will vote against it. We are totally opposed to it on principle.' The Greens have said much the same as well. They said, `We won't be bribed. We will vote against it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The majority in this chamber are on the record from day one as saying that they will vote against the Telstra part&hyphen;privatisation bill. When we bring the bill to the chamber, what do they say? They say, `We need a long and careful deliberation on this bill through the committee system before we then vote against it.' What a farce. That is destructive of the whole committee system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about the witnesses who are supposed to come along and contribute constructively to the better knowledge of the Senate? Are you telling them in advance that they might as well not bother because you are not going to listen to what they say because you approach the debate with a closed mind? You do. You are on the record time and again saying, `Whatever is put up in relation to this bill, we will vote against it.' Why do you want to defer it from this sitting of parliament to the budget sitting? It is very mysterious, except that you do not have the intestinal fortitude to come in here and vote against it. Former Senator Evans, your deputy leader, said that that is exactly what you would do. When he was asked on television what he would do with the Telstra debate, he said, `The coalition can bring it on and we will vote against it.' But when it comes to the Senate, the Labor Party, the Democrats and the Greens do not even have the courage to do that. What a lot of wimps!</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> But that is not as important as how you mislead the Australian people into believing that you are seriously interested in a committee process when you are not. That is what the farce is; that is the disgrace of what you are proposing. You are not interested in a genuine committee debate on this matter at all. You have said that from the start.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let it be put on the record exactly what the position of the government is. The government, whether you like it or not, believes that it has a right to put this bill to a vote. It believes, having put it clearly and unambiguously before the Australian people at the last election, that it not only detailed its intentions in relation to the part-privatisation of Telstra but also detailed what it would do with the capital that would be raised from that part-privatisation. As you know, $1 billion will go into a Natural Heritage Trust to provide a major environment program. The balance, which the government hopes will be about $7 billion, will be used to repay public debt as a key part of the government's overall economic program in order to keep down interest rates and allow small business to expand, to grow and to employ.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government was not only open and frank with the community about its intentions in relation to the part-privatisation of Telstra but it went one step further and detailed how it intended to appropriate the proceedings. We believe we have a right to get that to a vote. That is our objective. Let us not be in any way ambiguous about that. I thought, although obviously I was wrong, that we were doing the courteous thing by informing the Senate early on that if there was insufficient time in these six weeks of sittings to properly deal with that particular issue we would be seeking an extension of the Senate sittings for that purpose.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition, the Democrats and the Greens want to avoid a vote on this particular bill. They have told us how they are going to vote, but they are not prepared to do so. They believe that by avoiding a vote they are in some way avoiding the consequences of refusal to pass the bill. That is the only possible explanation of what they are seeking, in the light of the history that they have said that they will vote the bill down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have the numbers in this place. If they determine that they will not allow votes on government legislation then they can do that. That is what they are apparently doing in this instance. In the same vein, it is interesting that we are sitting for the third week and so far the majority in this place has allowed the government to pass one bill. I know how easy it is for a combination of opposition and minority parties who wish to be obstructive to block the Senate time. We did not do that because we realised that it would make the Senate unworkable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, in this instance it is different. We have a conspiracy of friends on the other side of the chamber. The Labor Party has already sent the signals that it is going to be an obstructionist opposition. There is no doubt about that at all. It has not come to grips with its election loss. It has failed to appreciate that the people of Australia threw it out because it failed them. It cannot accept the judgment of the people. It is not prepared to allow the government in this place to attempt to achieve passage of its legislation. It is not even prepared to allow the government to get it to a vote. What could be a clearer indication of a refusal to pass than the intention of the opposition, the Labor Party, to avoid a vote by passing it out to a committee with a reporting date that is not until the beginning of the next sittings of the parliament, the budget sittings? That is the Labor Party's intention and, of course, its allies, the Australian Democrats and the Greens, join with it in this particular proposal.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just so I have the opportunity to clarify it&mdash;because Senator Faulkner was obviously struggling with that particular issue, Senator Schacht&mdash;the natural heritage bill, when it is an act, will provide for the disbursement of the funds. It will start to operate in the second half of next year. Do you understand that, Senator Schacht? That is the reason why it is not before the Senate at the moment. Unless we get the Telstra sale bill through, we cannot provide the funding base for the money to flow into the Natural Heritage Trust.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe that Senator Faulkner is so silly that he cannot see that. That just becomes another excuse to avoid facing up to this bill through a voting process. It is regrettable that apparently the Labor Party, the Greens and the Democrats are not going to allow this government to achieve a vote on what it regards as a most important piece of legislation. It is a critically important piece of legislation, not only in providing the $1 billion funding base for the Natural Heritage Trust to enable it to solve some of our environment problems but, perhaps even more importantly, in repaying a very substantial amount of public debt and getting all the economic benefits that flow from that which can help build the economy again and provide jobs for some of the hundreds of thousands of Australians who are still out of work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We support the committee system in this place and we think that it is reasonable that a committee should have an opportunity to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="756"> look at this bill. We are proposing, therefore, as an amendment to Senator Faulkner's amendment&mdash;and I might have to foreshadow it&mdash;to provide for a reasonable time frame. We are suggesting that the committee should report back on 17 June and that it should be a legislation committee and not a references committee. We are dealing with a bill, and the Senate's process for dealing with a bill is to send it to a legislation committee. I will therefore move an amendment to that effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of the numbers the Labor Party wants the bill to go to a committee that is irrelevant. They are terrified, in fact, that the committee might bring it back at an earlier date, in accord with the government's wishes, and they cannot have that. If your real purpose is to avoid a vote on the bill&mdash;and that is clearly the real purpose of the Labor Party in this instance&mdash;then you send it to a references committee and not to the proper committee, a legislation committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our suggested date of 17 June would allow almost four weeks for the committee to do its work, including two up weeks. I notice in here that Senator Faulkner, to make it as difficult as possible, has said the committee has to sit in every state and territory capital. In other words, you build up the workload of the committee so that it is impossible for it to do its work within the time frame.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to reassure Senator Alston that a couple of days after the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) suggested that people should write to the Greens and other parties to tell them what they thought about the sale of Telstra, we did get a rash of letters. When I first asked my office manager, `How many letters have we received?', she said, `I think 40 so far.' I said, `What's the count for and against?' She said, `Forty don't want you to sell and none want you to sell.' She rang back and said, `I'm sorry, I was wrong. It is 65&hyphen;nil.' Later on it changed. It was 85&hyphen;1. But you are still a long way behind, I am afraid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Basically, there is a great deal of community concern. Any party, whether government or opposition, is showing its arrogance if it is suggesting that it knows so much about the issue that it does not need to bring the community into the process at this stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a suggestion that a couple of weeks is adequate and that this has been proven. Just out of curiosity, we looked at the time that has been taken to look at bills over the years, since 1970. In fact, the average time taken has been three months. I am happy to table this document. It goes to 1990, when we brought in the Selection of Bills Committee. That has brought about the difference between a Friday committee and a full reference committee. Those issues which are extremely important need proper scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at what we get with a couple of weeks. You do have to advertise, assuming that you actually believe the community ought to have the chance to make submissions. If <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> you want to cut them out of the process, just like the government wanted to cut out debate in the House of Representatives, you do not advertise; you do not allow people from various parts of the country who have experience in telecommunications and have concerns about it to have any input. That is what the government is suggesting. I believe that is wrong. For the last couple of months I have been clearly saying that to anybody who has asked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you advertise, you need time to receive submissions. To suggest that this could all be done by 17 June is sheer nonsense. If you are going to have public hearings, when do you cut off the time for people to put in submissions? How do you organise a committee in two non-sitting weeks? You have to advertise, receive submissions and have all of those hearings in two weeks on a bill for which there has not even been a committee stage in the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Are you suggesting that it is sufficient, for a bill of this importance, to choose only peak groups to come and speak? Are you suggesting you bring in only national industry bodies, national union bodies and government departments? Is that what you are suggesting is full public consultation? That is what happens when you have a short committee. The chair and the secretariat decide who is invited to speak. If you do not actually advertise, community consultation is very selective.</PARA>

I believe that the government's announced schedule is incredibly questionable in that there are very grave doubts about whether the government can organise a float with respect to the partial sale of Telstra this year or next year given that the last part of the Commonwealth Bank is still to be sold; the airports are still to be sold&mdash;there is not even a bill before the parliament to deal with that, yet that is the coalition's agenda&mdash;and Jeffrey Kennett is still busily selling off three&hyphen;quarters of Victoria. There is a limit as to how much public floats can succeed in this kind of environment. The second point about why the bill is not urgent&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="ALSTON" NAMEID="LD4">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator Alston</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It does not prescribe a timetable.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XW4">Senator KERNOT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You say `in accordance with the government's announced schedule', Senator Alston. The second point is that we should not be moving to vote for this bill when we still do not know what is in the post&hyphen;1997 regulatory framework. There is no bill from Senator Alston before the parliament yet. The point we would make on that is that the final value that you are going to ask for Telstra, or that somebody is willing to pay for Telstra, is going to be very closely linked with what we find out about the regulatory framework because it will affect the attitude of some people who might consider themselves to be in the market now and who may wish to say, `Look, if that is the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="759"> kind of consumer protection I have to offer, I am not interested in buying it.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third point is that I do not believe we should pass this bill when the Natural Heritage Trust Fund Bill is not before the Senate either. It is not on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>. It is nowhere to be seen because Senator Hill has suddenly said he does not want to clog up our program with bills that are non&hyphen;essential. The government asserted from day one, `We had to sell Telstra mainly so we can fund our super&hyphen;duper, bigger and better than ever before in the history of the universe environment package.' The government has insisted on this link. We said the link was dishonest. The government has insisted the link was important and it has undermined the integrity of its own argument, in my view, by not having both bills ready at the same time. If one is essential, the other is essential. If one is non&hyphen;essential, the other is non&hyphen;essential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth point, without going into the details of what we think of the nexus, is that it is perfectly appropriate for the Senate to do what the House of Representatives has failed to do. I was just having a little aside with Senator Harradine. In all of those debates about guillotines in this chamber over the last six years, I listened very intently to Senator Alston, Senator Kemp and others saying, `Freedom of speech&mdash;we can't gag or guillotine debates,' and I believed you. I really believed you cared about freedom of speech. Now you have crossed to the government benches and what have you done? You gagged the Telstra bill in the House of Representatives to get it into the Senate. That makes it all the more important that the Senate does what the House of Representatives failed to do&mdash;scrutinise the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Alston and Senator Hill say that everybody who is opposed to the sale of Telstra has a closed mind on the issue. Equally, it could be said that everybody who keeps asserting that privatisation and private sector ownership automatically improves efficiency has a closed mind and an ideologically rigid view about why we should proceed with further privatisations. When I asked Senator Alston about a briefing for the Democrats on the Telstra bill, I recall that he looked at me <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a little incredulously and said, `But you're not interested in the bill. You're going to vote against it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recall that I said, I am interested to have the opportunity to test the assertions in the bill&mdash;assertions that were made in the second reading speech in the other place about whether the universal service obligations are adequately protected, about the impact of privatisation on employment and economic activity, about proposed foreign investment restrictions on Telstra, and about the impact on public sector savings. Just because we disagree in principle does not mean that your bill should not be tested through scrutiny.' That is what this committee provides an opportunity to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think Senator Hill's amendment to change the reporting date from 24 August to 17 June is unreasonable in its time frame by the time the committee has an opportunity to advertise and to set committee hearing dates. It is a pity Senator Hill is not able to be here because it would be interesting for him to hear what he said in a previous time in September 1993. It is interesting that I should be here so long to see you swap sides and then say exactly the opposite of what you have been saying for six years. However, this is what Senator Hill said in 1993:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The danger in making these references too short is that the work that is done perhaps is not of as high a quality as the Senate has a right to expect.</PARA>
<PARA>Then, in justifying his putting a matter to a reference, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I put this reference to the Senate today as a constructive effort to better inform the Senate of what is an important but nevertheless difficult issue in order that the industry and communities most concerned by this . . . proposal of the government can be properly brought within the parliamentary process. This chamber needs to be fully informed so that its final determination in relation to the bill can be based on sound evidence and careful consideration, rather than what is sometimes the case&mdash;insufficient deliberation simply because of the nature of the conduct of this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA>All we have had are a few opportunities in question time to ask a few issues about the Telstra bill. That is why I think a committee process, which is not unduly long in my view, does afford us a better opportunity to test the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="760"> assertions and exercise the scrutiny which is appropriate to this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, Senator Alston could not help himself. He had to say a few things about mandate, so I have to say a few things in response. Senator Faulkner beat me to it by referring to what John Howard had to say on mandate, but I think the fact that the Prime Minister had that to say in 1987 is very interesting: the fact that he says that the mandate theory of politics has always been absolutely phoney. But I like what Peter Reith had to say in 1985, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the founding fathers established the terms of both Houses they did so on the basis of a mandate at different points in time for both chambers. That system was established as a means of buttressing the essential characteristic of the Senate as a House of review . . . </PARA>

There are a lot of assertions that are being made about mandate, and there are a lot of assertions that are being made about exit polls taken on election night and the Liberal Party having the key to knowing how everybody voted and why they voted for a change of government. They failed to acknowledge that we had something like 50 detailed policies released in 35 days but were confident that when everyone went to the ballot box they cast their vote in the light of perfect information of all the detail of all of these policies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know in commonsense terms that is not how it happens, and we know that we do not have sophisticated exit polls, as they do in America. Therefore, with respect to what you assert about why people voted as they did, I can say something quite the opposite in good faith, because I believe the opposite to be true. I would rather rely on Hugh Mackay, who wrote an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on the Monday after the election campaign. I think <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Hugh Mackay is regarded as a reasonable observer and commentator. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is true that there is a mandate for any move that will improve the financial position of families or encourage new employment initiatives by small business, since both were such persistent themes in the Coalition's campaign. And while nobody will be surprised when the Government prepares legislation for the part-privatisation of Telstra, the Government, in its turn, had better not act surprised when the move is blocked in the Senate and when there turns out to be strong community opposition to it.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">To suggest it has a mandate to sell part of Telstra to finance its environment policy would be sheer nonsense. That nexus was the most heavily criticised aspect of Coalition policy and it would be outrageously insensitive to the mood of the people to pretend that this was not abundantly clear to all concerned before the new Government took office.</PARA>
<PARA>I think we are entitled to rely upon somebody who has proven himself to be so independent and such an astute observer. He has a full-time job observing the way we behave, what we think and why we do what we do.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So let's not get bogged down in the issue of, `We are doing this because we have a clear-cut mandate to do it.' Let's focus on the issues that are in the proposal to partially privatise Telstra. Let's test the assertions that the government makes about it. They have gleefully asserted that it adds to national savings, even though there are so many people who say that that is not true. They have gone on to assert that the universal service obligations and the consumer safeguards are the best they have ever been and provide the kind of appropriate protection well into the next century. I say let's test the assertions with a short committee, and I am happy that it seems the majority of the non-government senators in the Senate support this view.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the motion in relation to the Telstra bill moved by my colleague the Leader of the Opposition in the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="761"> Senate, Senator Faulkner, and supported by the Greens and by the Australian Democrats. I do so because they have all put very well the case about this very important piece of legislation which is partly privatising the biggest company in Australia, and we all know that the partial privatisation will ultimately lead to full privatisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra is a company that employs 70,000 people and provides about 90 per cent of the telecommunications system in Australia to the Australian people. We all accept now that access to telecommunications is a necessity and that people are diminished if they do not have access to the telecommunications system. We have all heard before phrases such as, if you do not have access to the full system, you are information poor; if you do have access to it, you are information rich. Others have expounded on that at great length.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has come in here and complained that the cut&hyphen;off rules are unfair. When they were in opposition they thought they were a wonderful idea. When they put them up they believed they were in perpetual opposition so it was good fun to put those limitations on the then government. Now they come in here whingeing and whining that it is all very unfair&mdash;`Look, we won an election, we should be treated differently from the way we treated the Labor Party when they were the government.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a difference between the committee the government is referring this matter to and the committee proposed by the opposition with the support of the minor parties. As Senator Margetts rightly pointed out, your process is mickey mouse. It is nothing more than an opportunity to round up a few of the usual suspects&mdash;the major industry organisations, the ACTU, the union&mdash;bring them to Canberra for a couple of quick Friday afternoon hearings, and that's it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The general community&mdash;particularly rural and regional areas where the biggest issue is the cross&hyphen;subsidy operation&mdash;will not get an opportunity to voice their opinions. Mr and Mrs Average Australian Farmer will not have the opportunity to take part in the process <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Senator Hill has put up as the reasonable way to deal with this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From 1983 to 1995&mdash;the period of the previous government&mdash;258 pieces of legislation, big and small, went off to general reference committees, while 32 went to select committees and 38 to joint committees. So you cannot say it is unusual to allow three months in which to examine a major piece of legislation that will fundamentally change our telecommunications structure and operation and, as we know it will, lead to full privatisation. That is not unreasonable, but it is unreasonable for Senator Hill to say, `We will do it all in four weeks. We will have a couple of quick hearings and it will all be over.' It is unreasonable for him to say, `The people know the legislation because we campaigned on this issue.' Certainly, you did, but there was no bill before the people, there was no detail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this bill there are very important issues to be dealt with. For example, Senator Alston talks at great length about the universal service obligation, saying he has taken a provision straight from the existing Telecommunications Act and put it in this bill so that there is absolute protection. The present law says that all people in Australia, wherever they reside or carry on business, will continue to have reasonable access on an equitable basis to standard telephone services and pay phones. It says this requirement should be fulfilled as efficiently and economically as practicable. A lot of people would like to test whether that still holds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was okay when the minister had the power to direct the corporation but Senator Alston has not pointed out that power has been removed. The minister, after this privatisation, could no longer direct. We understand why that is so. If you want $7 billion for a third of Telstra you do not want to tell the private sector that there is a minister in Canberra who can second guess any decision and direct the corporation. That provision had to be removed but that leaves it completely up to the board&mdash;a board with minority foreign ownership and other domestic private interests&mdash;to determine the universal service obligation.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="762">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although you have called for more information to be provided to you, minister, when you get it you cannot do anything with it except to say, `Go back and try again.' You cannot direct the whole of Telstra because you cannot overrule the minority interests. You have not exempted this new organisation from the Corporations Law which provides that minority shareholders have to be equally represented by all directors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are issues I would like the community to be able to debate. I may not have the details perfectly correct but I bet a lot of other people do not either. These are the sorts of issues that have to be debated in the community, with the community having the opportunity to make sure&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The major weakness in your terms of reference is that there is nothing in them, as there is in ours, about what you are going to do in light of the post&hyphen;July 1997 regulatory regime. You have said that you want to re&hyphen;do the former minister's exposure draft of last year. You held a public hearing last week. However, we all know, and you should know, that no&hyphen;one will put any money into a privatised Telstra until they know exactly what the parliament will do about the post&hyphen;July 1997 regulatory regime. One clause in that bill could change the value and investment pattern of Telstra. You know that as well as I do. All the scoping studies you are doing mean nothing until people know what the rules and regulations will be after July next year and in what environment the privatised Telstra will be operating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are just some of the issues the community&mdash;including the Senate&mdash;need the opportunity to debate properly.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of things need to be considered, not least of which is the philosophical approach that is being taken by the government and which was put to the people.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra is a substantial regional employer. Some commentators are predicting that there will be substantial cuts.

<STATE> (Queensland)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(7.20 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight on a matter of some seriousness and also of great sadness. I note the presence in the chamber of the former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Bob Collins. He would probably be as saddened as I was to hear of the passing of Mr Joe Farley, who was the Executive Director of the Australian Cane Farmers Association.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Farley passed away quite recently, and his funeral was on Friday. I thought it would be appropriate to take the opportunity in this place to put on record Mr Farley's achievements, both as a tireless worker for the sugar industry in Queensland and also as a very fine lobbyist, a very great humorist at times, and somebody whose advice I came to rely on quite closely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Farley, surprisingly, was an American by birth and was a former colonel in the United States Air Force. Some of the funny stories that Joe sometimes told related to his tours of duty in Vietnam, which ranged from helping to organise the so-called Puff the Magic Dragon aircraft to his last tour of duty which involved working in psychological warfare. He tells the story of how they used <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to fly around in Hercules and the back tail would drop down and there would be huge loud speakers playing funeral music. Broadcast over the top of this funeral music were messages in Vietnamese telling the combatants below of the dreadful consequences that would come to pass if they lost the battle and how they were unlikely to ever again see their wives, girlfriends and children. Joe remarked that it was probably the most dangerous of any of the things he did in Vietnam because you tended to draw fire from both sides of the battlefield. They were all equally unwilling to hear this particular message.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Joe eventually came to Australia and became the Executive Director of the Australian Cane Farmers Association. Senator Collins, I am sure, would be one of the first to put on record the very strong lobbying to which he was subjected by Mr Farley on behalf of the ACFA when, in 1993, it came time for the sugar industry in Queensland to have a restructure package. It was, in part, Mr Farley's sterling efforts that made it possible to get that restructuring package for the Queensland sugar industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sad thing about Joe Farley's passing is that very few of us knew that Joe was ill. I suppose that is the sort of man he was. He did not seem to bother other people much with his problems. He was always working to solve other people's problems. I also know that he was very proud of his family, his children and their achievements. Every time I spoke to Joe, we seemed to talk as much about his family as we did about the problems or the joys of the sugar industry at any given point in time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For me it was very saddening that I could not attend the funeral on Friday because I had prior commitments in Cairns. I think it is very appropriate to say that there is not a canegrower in Queensland who is not better off for Mr Farley's efforts, whether they are a member of the Australian Cane Farmers Association or not. Joe Farley's sterling work really has benefited the entire sugar industry and the entire state of Queensland. I feel very saddened by his loss. I have lost a good friend, the sugar industry has lost a great <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="764"> champion and I know that his children have lost a great and proud father.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I want to put on record my sincere sympathies to his family at this time. I hope that they can, as much as possible, overcome their grief and celebrate all the great things that their father stood for. He was a really great champion of primary industry, a great Queenslander&mdash;I think he would be proud to hear that said&mdash;and a great Australian.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>  of Friday, 10 May 1996, Mr Richard Ackland, a journalist working for that paper, came close to belittling the endeavours of Mr Damien Bugg QC to ensure a fair trial for Mr Martin Bryant, the person accused of the terrible massacres at Port Arthur. Mr Bugg QC is the Director of Public Prosecutions in Tasmania.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That the fearful slaughter on the Tasman Peninsula was an outrage which has shocked not only Australians but people around the globe is beyond dispute. That decent citizens throughout the nation and throughout the world want the speedy end to the potential for such shootings is manifest. That society waits to see the person who carried out the deadly actions properly dealt with is palpable. That the horror of Port Arthur has brought emotions within the community to understandably high levels is obvious.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All this makes the lot of a Director of Public  Prosecutions most difficult. His or her job is to keep any element of lynch law out of the legal process by which a person is tried for a crime. Mr Bugg, for example, must ensure that the passion, the bias, the rage engendered by the events in Tasmania are not fed by such publicity as would put at risk the fair trial of a person accused of the ghastly killings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my youth I was a reader of westerns. The one that has stayed in my memory is <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Ox-Bow Incident</EMPHASIS> by Walter Van Tilburg Clark&mdash;a novel which dealt with the tragic lynching of three people. The following is a passage from it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And he&mdash; <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>a main character in the story&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">went on to prove how the greater "we" as he called it&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the local community&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">could absorb a few unpunished criminals, but not unpunished extra&hyphen;legal justice. He took examples out of history. He proved that it was equally true if the disregard was by a ruler or by a people. "It spreads like a disease" he said "And it is infinitely more deadly when the law is disregarded by men pretending to act for justice than when it's simply inefficient, or even than when its elected administrators are crooked."</PARA>
<PARA>The media hold that people have a right to know, but do the media have a right to exploit high emotions to bolster the fame of its journalists or the fortunes of its owners when in so doing it puts at risk the integrity of the law? Ours, we hope, is a fair society. All of us ought to put in the effort and exercise the restraint necessary to keep it that way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of Australia's most prestigious papers has thought it proper to discount with the suggestion of a sneer the endeavours of Mr Bugg to see as far as he can that justice is done with respect to the shootings at Port Arthur. That is unfortunate journalism. I know he will not wilt under the attack and will do his duty most honourably.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am discussing the need to have the law operate fairly and efficiently. In that context it is appropriate to mark the work done by Mr John Johnson and his force in respect of the slaughter on the Tasman Peninsula. Mr Johnson is Commissioner of Police in Tasmania. He acted with due regard for law throughout the crisis. He showed grace under pressure. He is a man of great capacity and of great distinction. He surely earned the admiration and gratitude of all Australians during that cruel episode in their history.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this evening to voice a number of concerns that I have about ongoing and pending environmental problems in my home state of Queensland. Indeed I am so concerned about these issues that I am prepared to miss the State of Origin broadcast, or at <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="765"> least the beginning of it, to ensure that these concerns are put on the record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard a lot from the new federal government about their commitment to the environment and the need to provide funds to ensure that a range of environmental needs are met. Yet there seems to be little commitment to ensure that the decisions of government now being made are not contributing to a worsening of these environmental problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is false to suggest that all our environmental problems are due to a lack of money. That is the slogan that seems to be the only response we are getting from government at the moment. Just take today's question time as evidence. The suggestion that the problems are all due to a lack of money hides the fact that the majority of environmental problems stem from decisions and actions of government or from acts of omission by government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week we saw many examples of the Queensland coalition parties' lack of commitment to the protection of our environment. It is not going too far to say that Wednesday of last week was a day of shame for the Queensland government in respect of the environment. The day started with the news that there would be a further delay to the start of the new Environment Protection Act. Following this, the Premier, Mr Borbidge, reaffirmed his opposition to the Cape York agreement reached between local Aboriginal groups, pastoralists and conservationists&mdash;indeed, a historic document and agreement but one which the Premier is prepared to discount. It is a great shame that the Premier is unable to see or acknowledge the marvellous potential of this agreement and the real breakthrough which it represents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In state parliament on Wednesday morning, energy minister, Mr Tom Gilmore, reaffirmed his determination to proceed with the disastrous Tully&hyphen;Millstream plan. I must say that I believe many in the government are not as committed as he is, at least on this plan. However, he restated his absolute pursuit of a hydro-electric scheme on the site of the Tully&hyphen;Millstream. The federal government is being conspicuously silent on this major threat to a world heritage area. Then came <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> news that there were calls for a new woodchip export licence in Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next environmental threat is a prime example of what happens when governments refuse to act to protect the environment&mdash;that is, land clearing. It is well known that Queensland has the highest rate of land clearing in the country, far more than the other states combined. This is a scandal yet the state government is still not acting to address this. I agree, there were problems with some of the attempts of the previous government to address land clearing but it is inexcusable to remove those controls without ensuring some other mechanisms are put in their place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To top off this day, Mr Gilmore again spoke to the state parliament reaffirming his commitment to connect the main electricity grid to areas north of the Daintree river through the world heritage area into Cow Bay&mdash;a place which I have visited and which certainly is the most marvellous environmental area that I have been to for many days&mdash;despite the potential environmental impact on this very fragile area and the fact that the draft wet tropics management plan has not been finalised. These are just a few of the threats to the environment being posed by this new coalition government in Queensland. All of this happened on the one day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have raised concerns in the Senate in recent weeks about the wrong&hyphen;headed approach of the Queensland government to power supply and electricity generation issues and the environmental and economic dangers of that approach, but let me give them a tick for cancelling the Eastlink project. I have also spoken of the environmental threat of the proposed super piggery near Warwick.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to see what the federal government and its Minister for the Environment, Senator Hill, are prepared to do about the ongoing and expanding environmental damage being wreaked in Queensland by the actions of the state government. Does their alleged concern for the environment extend beyond arguing about funding? I want to see them take actual concrete action to protect the environment right now.</PARA>

<STATE> (New South Wales)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(7.34 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Members of the Senate will recall that in the run&hyphen;up to the last federal election the Chief Justice of the Australian Industrial Relations Court, Mr Murray Wilcox, clearly intervened in a very political environment to claim that there was no need for the industrial relations law relating to unfair dismissal to be changed in the way the then opposition was saying it should be changed. The coalition's policy of correcting the unreasonable and unfair aspects of the wrongful dismissal legislation resulted in this unprecedented intervention by the chief judge of a court in a political environment. It was, in many people's view, not only extraordinary but also, in a sense, totally improper.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The basis on which Mr Murray Wilcox made this intervention was that in his view the wrongful dismissal legislation was working well, it was protecting the rights of workers and so on. I presume he was not simply looking to protect his own position and that of the court in this matter but was presenting a view which was aimed at influencing a political outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An extraordinary thing happened last week. The very same Mr Murray Wilcox handed down a judgment in which he ruled he could not find in favour of three workers who had been `harshly, unjustly and unreasonably dismissed' because of a loophole in the industrial law. This is the law that Mr Wilcox went on record before the election saying should not be changed, yet here we have a clear indication of that law being so imperfect that it disadvantaged three workers who had been&mdash;and I repeat&mdash;`harshly, unjustly and unreasonably dismissed'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of last Friday, and I commend page 7 of the review to members of the Senate, deals with this matter without in fact mentioning Mr Wilcox's previous involvement in political discussions of this sort of legislation. I will read a little of this article of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> into the record. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A legal loophole in the unfair dismissal laws has allowed company director, Mr Achilles Constantinidis&mdash;   <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>a name that might ring a bell with some members of this place&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a former business partner of ex&hyphen;Prime Minister, Mr Paul Keating, to unfairly dismiss three workers employed by a piggery previously owned with Mr Keating.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Chief Justice of the Industrial Relations Court, Mr Murray Wilcox, found yesterday Mr Constantinidis had harshly, unjustly and unreasonably terminated the workers employment "rather than take the trouble to sort out problems largely of his own making".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">But the Chief Justice was "regretfully" unable to order reinstatement or compensation because the men had been retrenched by one company directed by Mr Constantinidis and offered casual employment with another company he effectively controlled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Casual employees are excluded from access to the federal unfair dismissal laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The employees slipped through the legal loophole after a complex transfer of ownership between companies directed by Mr Constantinidis.</PARA>
<PARA>The article then goes on to deal with who owned the companies, and I will cover this briefly. The piggery was owned by Brown and Hatton Group Pty Ltd and operated by its subsidiary, Brown and Hatton Rural Pty Ltd, but was sold to Parkville Pig Stud Pty Ltd on 11 May 1994, with Rural continuing to operate the piggery until 30 June.</PARA>
<PARA>The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>  article goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Chief Justice Wilcox found that the workers had been made redundant by Rural on June 28&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>That was because this piggery was ceasing to operate and another Constantinidis company was going to begin operating it on 1 July. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The men were offered casual employment by Parkville on the same day. Two days later, they were given documents to sign which were incomplete and still showed their employment as Rural&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, Brown and Hatton Rural. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When they refused to sign the documents, Mr Constantinidis sacked the men&mdash;a course the Chief Justice found was harsh, unjust and unreasonable.</PARA>
<PARA>I remind the Senate that Mr Constantinidis is Mr Keating's former partner&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;His front man: I acknowledge the interjection. Mr <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="767"> Keating was so close to him that at one stage he gave Mr Constantinidis his power of attorney. And, to my knowledge, that authorisation still resides in the official documentation at the Titles Office in Sydney. The article continues:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Chief Justice said Brown &amp; Hatton Rural had a valid reason for terminating employment of the workers on June 28 because it was going to cease operating the piggery.</PARA>
<PARA>But then the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>  goes on to say this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One fundamental point the judgement did not address is whether beneficial ownership actually changed.</PARA>
<PARA>That, of course, is the essence of this business. What this judgment shows is that if you want to get around these laws and deprive the workers of Australia of the rights that Mr Justice Murray Wilcox said were so central, all you do is create another company that you own, that you are a director of and that you run, and say that you are going to take over the activities of company A with this new company B.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because company A is finishing up its running of the operation, you give the people notice and then you offer to take them on as casuals&mdash;without proper acceptance in this case, by the way; no documents were signed. In fact, the men refused to sign the document when they eventually saw that it was bereft of information, except for the wrong information that the employer was going to be Brown and Hatton Rural. So you create a situation where the employees cease being permanent employees, and they suddenly become temporary employees and are given no protection whatsoever under this act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It strikes me as incredible, first of all, that Mr Wilcox could find that way without going behind the corporate veil. What prompted him to that judgment I simply do not know because it certainly does not appear to be rational. But what concerns me is that every time Mr Keating's piggery partner is shown up to have done something disgraceful or improper&mdash;and in this case it is acknowledged that what he did was `harsh, unjust and unreasonable'&mdash;there is a device in the law <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> enabling him to escape the consequences of his impropriety.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We saw that environmental laws were broken by one of his companies. But he got around that by failing to register the transfer of that business into another name. I might say that,  once again, in this case it was not transferred. There are many matters I believe should be raised&mdash;and I hope to do so at some later stage&mdash;relating to the detail of this kind of judgment that Mr Wilcox has brought down. It is, in my view, an incredible judgment. But what concerns me even more is the calibre of the man that Mr Keating chose as his close partner and holder of his power of attorney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me remind the Senate that this unfair, unjust, harsh, unreasonable dismissal of these three men followed their complaint that they had been paid less than the award wage while Mr Keating was the half owner of this piggery for several years. It was after they complained and got paid their back pay for under award payments that they were summarily got rid of, using this quite deceptive and dishonourable device. I must say it is not only Mr Wilcox who regrets he has found that way. I must say I find that I regret that Mr Wilcox felt compelled to conclude that Mr Purdue and Mr Jackson had no remedy in relation to their termination of employment. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier today, there was unanimous support voiced for the decision by the government on gun control. I wish to look more broadly at that issue. I believe that the work so far of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the parties in this chamber provides an opportunity for the community to address the culture of violence which has emerged in our society. This measure on gun control is not the solution to all our social ills. The debate needs to go much further and look at the deeper causes of violence and alienation in our community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The culture of violence, which has been referred to many times, is one that we all contribute to in small ways and large. One <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="768"> example of violence being promoted as a solution to problems is the Premier in my state suggesting that capital punishment needs to be reintroduced. In a subtle way that sends a message that the only solution to some problems is more violence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to look at the denigration of women and the way in which our televisions and videos model violence as a prime solution to distress or problems that are faced within the community. The lack of funding for true preventive health measures contributes to a problem which we are seeing, with regret&mdash;that is an increasing degree of violence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I, as do the Western Australian Greens, support the proposition of a buyback compensation measure for gun owners. The suggestion of financing that by means of an increase in the Medicare levy seems reasonable, as this issue is one which involves the entire community. Hopefully, the proposal will contribute to a safer and more peaceful society. One would hope that the fact that the compensation is proposed to be derived from the Medicare levy means that it is more than just an economic and efficient technique for revenue raising. I would hope that it would be seen in the light of a broadening of the concept of health within our community to include safety and non&hyphen;violence. On that basis, I think it is to be commended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The political will which has mobilised around this issue has been remarkable. While totally supporting the proposal, I have felt ambivalent at times in that we could not generate the same political will to improve health care provisions that are so desperately needed. The mental health needs in our community are notorious. The way in which we neglect people within our community who require assistance and those who care for them is appalling. It is not simply the needs of the mentally ill which are the object of preventive health care. It is counselling facilities and resources within our community that meet the needs of people who are in crisis and people who are distressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have an increasing problem amongst our youth. They feel alienated and are struggling to find their place. They have difficulties in gaining employment and difficulties in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> simply adjusting to this rapidly changing world. It is those measures which I believe have to be looked at as well. I would like to see an equal degree of political will mobilised towards those issues rather than the regrettable cost cutting measures, which lead to an eking away of medical and health resources within our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The desire to provide compensation for gun owners is appropriate and right. Oh, that we could have had the same kind of political will to provide just and proper compensation for indigenous people in Australia, for whom the restoration of their land, or just compensation for it, is long overdue&mdash;more than 100 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A letter I received from a parish church gave a great illustration of the depth of concern that has been aroused in the community after the tragedy at Port Arthur and the steps that have been taken by this government in response to it. The letter points out that we could have gone further. A similar concern was also mentioned on page 11 of the report of the Australasian Police Ministers Council. It read:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has been much public disquiet in recent years regarding the large number of firearms kept in homes, particularly in residential areas.</PARA>
<PARA>The comments in area No. 8 of the report say that the government is not considering restricting the location of those firearms, that it is not imposing those kinds of restrictions. We should be aware that there are further steps that could have been taken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we should also be aware, as is pointed out in this letter, that concerns are being expressed within the gun lobby for more consultation and more discussion. I want to raise the issue that a public and open inquiry into firearm ownership and use and deaths in Australia may be appropriate at some stage. I certainly do not believe that it should pre-empt the worthwhile consensus that has emerged here. However, it may allow research and community sentiments to be expressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I close by quoting from this letter that I received, as did the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and the Leader of the Australian Democrats (Senator Kernot). The Reverend Dr Wes Campbell wrote:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="769">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">On Sunday the North Melbourne/Parkville congregation will offer prayers for the victims of the Port Arthur shootings, for those grieving, and for those of you with responsibility for public policy. While it is not possible to eradicate violence entirely, we may expect that such random acts of mass violence by firearms can in fact be curtailed by careful political decisions. Please do not step back from your grief and outrage; let that be the impetus to real leadership and change.</PARA>
<PARA>I thank that congregation and the Reverend Dr Wes Campbell for providing an example of the widespread concern in our community, which gives support to the measures that are being proposed at this time.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to take a few moments of the Senate's time tonight to address some taxation issues in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. I remind the Senate that in the late 1970s there was growing dissatisfaction with the current appeal processes involving the review of taxation issues. For example, references awaiting hearing as at 30 June 1974 were 448, while the number of references heard per annum was only 230. In addition, the number of references allowed by the department prior to listing was 56 and the number of settled pre-listing was 52, making 108. There was an apparent backlog of almost two years work. At the time it was contended that the commissioner was either inefficiently exercising his power of review at the rejection stage, or his inability to have matters heard by the board was forcing him to settle matters at something less than his full entitlement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue was essentially that it was taking too long to get questions determined by the boards of review. At the time it was suggested to either increase the number of boards while preserving the present composition, or restructure the boards, or conduct an administrative appeal type review. However, I am advised that increasingly of late, having gone for the latter option, boards of administrative appeal have reverted to the practices of the former boards of review of actually sitting three tribunal members. Perhaps this is not surprising, given the complexity of taxation legislation today.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the point that I wish to make tonight is that there have been cases where the view of the dissenting presiding member has prevailed against the view of the majority, even when, on the face of it, the majority actually comprised a taxation specialist. Honourable senators would realise that tax specialists are not necessarily always correct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a question that I believe needs answering. I ask the parliamentary secretary on duty, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Senator Tambling), to take this to the relevant minister, Senator Short. Given the restraint on expenditure, what is the justification for sitting three members in a tax jurisdiction? I also wish to pass on my concerns about specialists, even when a tax specialist is overridden in a majority position. I thank the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise briefly to respond to an article published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>  by a bit&hyphen;part journalist by the name of Malcolm McGregor. It was written some months ago and it has only been brought to my attention. Mr McGregor referred to me as a Tammany&hyphen;Hall thug. It seems to me that these days political journalists seem to think that they have a licence to write how they like without regard for truth, honesty or decency. By and large, I have shrugged off and ignored these ill-informed prejudiced bigots who have written much about me in the past 12 months, but this man deserves some special response.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr McGregor is a well&hyphen;known political carpetbagger and political prostitute who sells his dirty tricks, his political smears and his grubby practices to whoever is silly enough to cross his palm with corrupted silver. No doubt, the Labor Party has had its own experiences with Mr McGregor; however, having worked for them, he was employed by the federal secretariat of the Liberal Party. The Liberal Party got what you would expect when you deal with such people; they got a liar and a thief.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="770">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No doubt, the Senate will recall that on 18 May 1994 Dr John Hewson, then the leader of the Liberal Party, was interviewed by Kerry O'Brien on the ABC program <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS>. What was significant about that interview was that Dr Hewson was ambushed by O'Brien with secret Liberal Party research which was greatly damaging to Dr Hewson and to the Liberal Party, to which he had previously not been privy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At first the Liberal Party secretariat talked darkly about break-ins at the secretariat and such sinister goings&hyphen;on. However, the morning following the interview, one Mr Malcolm McGregor went to Mr Andrew Robb, the federal director of the Liberal Party, to say that obviously he would be under suspicion. However, he wanted to give his personal promise and undertaking to Mr Robb that he had not stolen or leaked the material. Of course, Mr McGregor was able to access the material because at that time he was employed in the federal secretariat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did subsequent events demonstrate? They demonstrated that Mr Malcolm McGregor stole the material and passed it on to the media either directly or indirectly for the purpose and intention of damaging the Liberal Party, the party which was paying him for its services. There was subsequent nonsense talk about the research being received behind the back of a menu in a restaurant and some other such nonsense. However, the truth is that Mr McGregor stole material from his employer. That is the man who has the audacity and the cheek to talk about me as a Tammany&hyphen;Hall thug.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by saying that Mr McGregor has never met me, he has never spoken to me and he has never had cause to report one single fact of truth about me. However, those of us who move in these circles know that truth is not one of Mr McGregor's stocks&hyphen;in&hyphen;trade.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>
