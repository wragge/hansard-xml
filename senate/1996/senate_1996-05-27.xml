<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Assistant Treasurer and Minister representing the Minister for Finance. I ask: are you aware of the technique used by companies where the legal owners of a corporate entity transfer the assets and liabilities of that entity to a second entity with a board that does not appear to be under their control in order to avoid legal and financial obligations that may apply to them as controllers of the first company? Can you confirm whether such a technique is commonly known as asset stripping? Do you approve of such arrangements and can you confirm whether the government has received any advice suggesting such a technique as a way of avoiding legislative restrictions on the sale of Telstra?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I am of course aware of the technique to which the shadow minister refers. I am also aware of course that asset stripping leads to the minimisation of tax in an illegal way. This is something which I am sure both sides of the parliament, and indeed all people, are strongly opposed to. The taxation laws and administration of this country are designed to prevent that sort of arrangement. The answer to the first part of your question is yes. As far as the second part of your question is concerned, it is not directly related to the first part.</PARA></TALK.START></ANSWER>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. As you will not make any comment and will not confirm that there is a connection between the processes of what you are doing with this non&hyphen;parliamentary route to privatise Telstra, can you at least give us confirmation that the estimated cost of going down the non&hyphen;legislative route would be at least $1 billion or up to $1.5 billion in stamp duty foregone? If you do accept that way, is that not more than the $1 <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> billion you were promising the environment, which destroys the whole environment package?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That question sounds as fanciful as any question from the opposition this session. So far as Telstra is concerned, the fact is that the government plans to progress the partial sale of Telstra through the parliament. We have brought forward enabling legislation as a matter of priority in order to achieve that. Yet the other side of the parliament&mdash;supported, aided and abetted by the minor parties I regret to say&mdash;has thrust off the proper consideration of Telstra and the government's proposals into the next session of parliament. I remain confident that the Telstra sale bill will be passed by the Senate. That is the government's position and we maintain it.</PARA></TALK.START></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Communications and the Arts. He will be aware of some expressions of feigned outrage about the possibility of the government exploring extraparliamentary options for the sale of Telstra. What is the government's attitude to this and why would it consider such options?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I am aware of some expressions of feigned outrage. They come from both the major opposition parties in this chamber. Indeed, I noticed Senator Schacht talked about an outrageous act of public vandalism. On <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS>  this morning, Senator Kernot said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Why go to the election campaign saying we are going to put this through the parliament and before we sell any more of it we will go back to the people.</PARA>
<PARA>Later on she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Either you say you won't bypass it even if you feel frustrated or you won't.</PARA>
<PARA>We did not say any of those things. Indeed, we remain committed to this bill going through the parliament. The tragedy is that you know full well that it should.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="SCHACHT" NAMEID="4J4">

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator Schacht</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Who has leaked all the advice?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are entitled to take advice about any alternative options that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> might become necessary. As a result of your intransigence and procrastination you may well force us to explore other options. Our preferred course of action is to go down the path that we have foreshadowed via legislation. Just in case anyone is in any doubt about who the real hypocrites are on this issue, if you talk about parliamentary vandalism you ought to have regard to what Paul Keating wanted to do with Telstra prior to the last election. If Senator Schacht wants to earn his keep as a shadow minister, he should tell us here and now whether it is still the your policy to sell off Mobilenet, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yellow Pages</EMPHASIS>  or OTC, because that is what Paul Keating wanted to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do you disown him or don't you? Is that still your policy? Are you in fact wanting to break Telstra up into bits and pieces? If he had his way you would have already flogged off about a third of Telstra's revenue stream. We have a perfect right&mdash;indeed, an obligation&mdash;to respond to public pressure which endorsed our proposal to privatise Telstra. If you are intent on blocking that, you must take the consequences of our pursuing other options. I hope the Democrats also read this morning's editorial in the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>? It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . is it fair to ask: precisely who needs to be kept honest? . . . the Democrats . . . have become a stronger force for opposition to the government's program than the ALP . . . an emerging contradiction in the party's raison d'etre . . . the spirit of the "Keep the Bastards Honest" approach that gave birth to the party was designed to ensure that each government, be it Labor or Liberal, kept its election promises and behaved honourably.</PARA>
<PARA>They have an existential conflict on how much they should represent their own ideology et cetera. The point remains that you know what the voters decided on 2 March in relation to Telstra. You are the ones who are deliberately frustrating the policy we took to the last election. We didn't say it, but it was always our preferred course to have legislation through the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are the ones who are going to ensure that that cannot happen&mdash;of course, you have closed minds on the issue; you are locked in because of your ideology and because of the trade union movement which pulls the strings <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1100"> and Senator Ray who pulls the other strings a little closer to the front of this chamber&mdash;that of course will mean we do have to examine other alternative courses; and we will, but it will be your fault if we have to go down that path. We are the ones who want the bill to go through parliament in accordance with the mandate we obtained. If you take the view that nothing will allow you to change your mind, that you are simply determined to frustrate that approach, you will bear the consequences.</PARA></ANSWER>
<QUESTION PAGE="1100" SPEAKER="Senator MICHAEL BAUME" NAMEID="LE4" ELECTORATE="UNKNOWN" PARTY="UNKNOWN" MINISTERIAL="UNKNOWN" GOV="2">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the minister for that response. I wonder whether he has seen the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>  of 7 February, which noted:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the assertion by one of the country's top corporate lawyers that Keating had, as late as one month ago been quietly sounding out captains of industry to see if they would head a taskforce to break up and privatise Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA>Former Senator Richardson said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This wimpish proposal did not satisfy Paul Keating, who wanted to go much further and sell off Telecom into the bargain.</PARA>
<PARA>I ask the minister: how different in principle is what he is suggesting from what was suggested on these previous occasions?'</PARA></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="1100" SPEAKER="Alston, Sen Richard" NAMEID="LD4" ELECTORATE="VIC" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Communications and the Arts" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did see that article and it is precisely what Paul Keating always wanted to do. If you look at what Home Alone did in the House of Representatives, you will find that he was mouthing precisely the same formula. In other words, what he was on about was preserving Telstra's so&hyphen;called core assets. That was the answer that Keating gave when he was asked about various proposals to asset strip Telstra. He fell back on the proposition that he was in favour of anything that was in the national interest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The crunch in all this was that when he was asked on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> in 1994 whether it really mattered whether Telstra was publicly or private owned, he said, `Not of its essence, no.' That is the Labor Party's current stated position. If you are about to disown him, tell us. Otherwise, the public is entitled to assume that you do have an alternative approach to this issue and that involves breaking up Telstra, doing what you have said for the last three years or more. Indeed, if we go back to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 1989 when Paul Keating sold off Aussat and wanted to sell off OTC, the public will know your attitude on this issue. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the senator for the opportunity to give this answer yet again in this place. I will continue to give the answer until, finally, senators opposite understand what the truth of the matter is. Senator, you quite rightly identify that this matter has been raised in this place in the past. You will see no inconsistency between what I have said here and what I said to Kerry O'Brien. I have made it abundantly clear. The things that are <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1101"> clear are twofold in respect of your question. First, I have never nominated a specific savings target for the higher education sector. I have been at pains to indicate, as I indicate to those opposite now&mdash;I repeat it again&mdash;that no decisions with respect to this matter have been made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I have done is ask the vice&hyphen;chancellors and other interested parties to take the opportunity to bring the knowledge that they have with respect to higher education and to use that knowledge to shape the savings proposal as opposed to allowing a savings proposal to shape higher education. Let me refer to what I have said in response to any specific questions put to me. You, senator, would know how bright the vice&hyphen;chancellors are and how cunning some of your people are&mdash;they are constantly asking, `Are you looking at five per cent? Are you looking at six per cent?' I will repeat to you what I said to Kerry O'Brien: if someone put a proposition to me, `Is it five per cent,' I would say, `Five per cent, I cannot say.' If someone said to me, `Is it five or 12,' I would say, `Five or 12, I cannot say.' What I made clear to him is what I made clear in this place last time you asked that question. I will keep giving you the same answer; that is the situation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, you may not have had the opportunity to peruse the article which Senator Coates is indirectly referring to. It is an article which was put on the internet by a number of academics and which I raised in this place in a debate on higher education last week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The particular article purports to be a precis of an after&hyphen;dinner speech, not on gifted children but given to a conference on gifted children. It is interesting to note that the alleged precis of this speech&mdash;which I regard as a quite mischievous send&hyphen;up of the speech, and that is being generous to the author&mdash;is not a precis that appeared a day or two after the event because somebody who heard what was said was distressed by it. Oh, no!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a precis that was cooked up some three or four weeks after the speech was given and distributed on the internet.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator O'Chee for the question. During this National Reconciliation Week the government will draw attention to the low state of health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and embark on a comprehensive strategy to rectify the situation. The previous government chose to ignore for too long the appalling state of Aboriginal health. We will not make the same mistake.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Extending the reach of a comprehensive primary health service system will be a key <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1106"> priority. Obtaining better coordination between Aboriginal and specific services in the mainstream state health systems is another priority. As well as building up the service infrastructure, the government will work with service providers, researchers and technical experts to ensure that we have comprehensive strategies in place to combat particular health challenges facing Aboriginal people, including cardiovascular and infectious diseases, including HIV&hyphen;AIDS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week, for example, the Minister for Health, Dr Michael Wooldridge, met with the Australian National Council on AIDS working group on indigenous sexual health. Dr Wooldridge will be working with them and Aboriginal service providers to respond to the threat of HIV&hyphen;AIDS to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. A national Aboriginal and Islander health council has been established as a forum for dialogue for Aboriginal community stakeholders, especially ATSIC and community&hyphen;controlled health organisations. Invitations to join this committee have been made and its membership is expected to be announced shortly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These measures collectively represent the start of an enormous task to improve the health standards in the indigenous community. For example, Northern Territory Aboriginals are on average roughly three times as likely to die at any age than their Western counterparts. This peaks at about 30 to 34 years of age, when their chances rise to 10.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Their life expectancy is also lower. Aboriginals generally have a higher, and in most cases very much higher, mortality rate from all causes except from neoplasms, although cervical cancer in women is almost six times the national rate. They also have a higher and ever growing incidence of circulatory disease, renal disease, obesity and diabetes, with all their complications, and are more likely to die from injuries or motor vehicle accidents. There are also more alcohol related deaths.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The crude birthrate and the neonatal death rate are higher. The stillbirth rate is almost three times and the infant mortality rate about four times that of non-Aboriginals. Nutritional deficiencies in infants under five years of age are also up. Infections and respiratory and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> parasitic diseases are much more common and leprosy and tuberculosis were once almost exclusively Aboriginal diseases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sexually transmitted disease is much more prevalent. AIDS is as yet an unknown quantity, but when it does appear it has the potential for devastating consequences. Trachoma and middle ear disease are rife. Although trachoma no longer causes so much blindness, it has serious sequelae.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

A question <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that has been raised, at least with me, is whether the general directions the minister has provided ATSIC requiring, as they do, the appointment of a special auditor and so on may at least have the effect of delaying these payments to communities simply by the established process being implemented.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Ferguson for that important question. The superannuation guarantee arrangements put in place by the previous Labor government are just one example of the policy changes that were introduced by Labor which have major shortcomings because of a lack of attention to detail. They could never get it right when it got to the detail right across the policy board. Problems with the superannuation guarantee are also indicative of the failure to address the concerns of average Australians which stem from the imposition of poorly thought through Labor government policy&mdash;something which, as I said, was so much a feature of Labor's term of office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The supposed solutions put forward by the former Labor government to the so-called <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1111"> small amounts issue do not address the underlying problem.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If you could just simmer down, Senator Sherry, you will get an answer to those things. RSAs will not, as I said last week to Senator Sherry and others, replace existing superannuation arrangements.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">RSAs will be a more suitable option for casual and itinerant workers by providing a single account in which small superannuation entitlements can be accumulated.

RSAs will allow employees to consolidate separate accounts&mdash;a very important but practical possibility.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill), to a question without notice asked by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Faulkner) today, relating to the qualification of Senator&hyphen;elect Jeannie Ferris.</PARA>
<PARA>Today we saw the government's latest attempt at a systematic cover&hyphen;up of this particular affair. We saw Senator Hill try to address the issue, and we saw him address it very ineptly. The government has made a monumental mistake here. Senator Minchin employed <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> someone whom he should not have employed. But, instead of going down the honest road, the government from day one has tried to dissemble and cover up the facts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today we had Senator Hill claiming that there was no employment agreement, when I have a copy of that agreement here and it has been tabled by his own government. Today we had Senator Hill saying that legal advice has been had to the effect that senators-elect are not covered, when his own Minister Jull has advised Senator Minchin that he had problems with the capacity of Senator-elect Ferris to hold her position and still hold an office in the senator's office. There has also been a referral to Senator Durack, who was Attorney-General in the Liberal government previous to this one, claiming that senators-elect are covered by section 44(i) of the constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Hill, you cannot run away from this issue; you will not be able to. It is not a matter of issuing pairs and numbers in this place because automatically we would issue pairs. This is a question of the validity of the deliberations of the Senate. Unlike every other such instance in recent years, in this particular case we know about the problem of Senator-elect Ferris&mdash;and, by knowing about it, the deliberations and the votes of the Senate could very well be tainted by the doubt over her capacity to sit here. Any one of South Australia's 700,000 voters is able to prosecute this matter if you do not&mdash;and you are not inclined to, as was indicated earlier today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue is, as I said earlier, not whether a senator-elect is covered by section 44(i), because the situations of Senator Durack and Senator Michael Baume are related by Mr Jull in arguing to Senator Minchin that senators-elect are covered. It is not a matter of the actual job, because Senator Vanstone has already admitted in her answer to me that the actual office that Senator-elect Ferris held is covered by section 44.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question is: did she hold the job? I asked the simple question on 1 May. That could have been answered on 2 May because the documentation shows that everything that was relevant to my question was available on <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1115"> 2 May. It took 19 days for the government to come up with an answer. All the information was on the record on 2 and 3 May, other than the legal advice which you did not give. You could have provided all that information 18 to 19 days before you chose to answer that question. When finally Senator Short fronted on this issue, he and Senator Vanstone did not know who was holding the baby.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But Senator Short was asked on 9 May about Senator-elect Ferris. All the information was available to him. He either had the brief there and was not prepared to answer the opposition's questions or, if he did not have the brief, he should have been asking questions of the Minister for Administrative Services. There is no conceivable way in which the previous government, if an issue had been on the public agenda for a week&mdash;as it had been before Senator Short was asked about it&mdash;would not have had a brief before the minister. He chose not to answer; he was buying time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then, of course, comes the hapless Senator Vanstone. She answered on 20 May. Her answer was full of holes, full of misleading statements; it was something that was of total disrespect to the Senate. She gave us a gloss on the employment situation of Senator-designate Ferris. But in that gloss there were some important aspects which were on the record in the department which did not even merit her recognition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why did she not mention, for instance, that there was a signed work agreement, an agreement signed on 18 March, some two months before the answer she gave to the Senate? Why did she not mention that salary had been paid and refunded and some 13 days salary had actually gone into Senator-elect Ferris's account? Why did she not mention that air travel had been paid and refunded? Why did she not mention that TA had been paid and refunded? Why did she not mention that $9,441.45 was, in fact, paid or taken back by the Department of Administrative Services? Why did she not mention Jull's letter of 3 April quoting Senator Durack and Senator Michael Baume? Why did she not mention Senator Minchin's four letters of approval? Why did she not mention that, after two <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> weeks in the job, Senator Minchin decided to give the Senator-elect a 22.5 per cent wage increase while reclassifying her? Why did she not mention that there was a meeting on 3 April and another one on 11 April where these matters were discussed? Why did she not mention that it was only on 19 April that Senator Minchin and Senator-designate Ferris decided to withdraw from this scam?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Vanstone, did you check your facts? Senator Hill, did you check your facts? Why are you misleading the Senate? You are misleading it because you know that there is absolutely no way you can define `volunteer' to mean someone who is paid $49,000 per annum plus $7,000 in travel in three weeks. Senator Short, can I say to you in closing: I did practise law.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Minchin was given permission to make a personal statement. When you read that personal statement and then go back and read all the documents in the return to order, you can see how dissembling that statement was by acts of ommission. Time and time again in that carefully crafted statement, Senator Minchin fails to tell the full facts. As Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, he should have done so. He makes mention just offhandedly towards the end of his statement that three days pay were made. He knows better than that. He knows that not only three days pay were paid to Ms Ferris but that another 10 days pay were paid to her, and that the Department of Administrative Services retrieved that money from the bank by way of fax&mdash;and Senator Minchin was <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1116"> present at a meeting when that was explained to him, as the file note shows.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Minchin has failed to say a whole lot of things.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He did not mention, for instance, that after just a few days work a 22&half; per cent pay rise was applied to this brilliant staffer who had no experience in Aboriginal affairs at all, if we are to believe the biography you put on the work contract, but who must have performed stunningly to get a 22&half; per cent pay rise after just a few days.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> If you think, Madam Deputy President, that this parliament has been misled, either willingly or accidentally, you should go back to an article in the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> of 2 March, which is a real bottler.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have misled the Senate today by talking about my meeting with a representative from DAS on Easter Monday.

Don't give me any of this stuff about Easter. I don't know what you are on about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The facts are that I proposed the appointment of Jeannie Ferris. Payments were made subject to the approval of the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Jull). The minister's approval was not granted. Therefore, there was no employment contract entered into, no employment contract at law and no office of profit created, and no section 44 question arose. Even if there was an office of profit, which there was not, it does not apply to senators&hyphen;elect, and it is an absolutely misleading statement by Senator Bolkus to say that Senator Durack says that it applies to senators&hyphen;elect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not what Senator Durack says. Senator Durack says that questions could be raised. Well, of course, questions could be raised; lawyers will ask questions about anything. How do you get a straight answer out of a lawyer? A lawyer will say you can ask a question about anything. Of course you can ask questions, but it depends on the answers. Of course a lawyer will say you can ask questions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Questions can be asked about section 44. You know as well as I do that section 44 needs amending, but section 44 does not apply to senators&hyphen;elect. Professor Lane said that; Christine Wheeler QC in Perth said that. It obviously does not apply to senators&hyphen;elect. It applies to candidates in an election `in the process of being chosen'. You people have probably never read the constitution, because you don't like it. You would like the constitution thrown out, wouldn't you? You want to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> throw away the whole bit, the whole box and dice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Section 44 says that it only applies to candidates because it talks about candidates `in the process of being chosen'. The process of being chosen applies from the day nominations open to polling day. Then it applies when you are sitting. It does not apply to senators&hyphen;elect. Are you suggesting that a senator elected in July of one year cannot work in the public sector at all until 1 July the next year? That is an absolute nonsense. So on two counts you come down. No office of profit was created, and section 44 does not apply to senators&hyphen;elect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is nothing in this. This is a great diversion by the poor old South Australian Labor Party. The South Australian Labor Party is in an absolute mess.

<PARA>The minister was asked: did she or did she not use the figure of 12 per cent? She, quite frankly, in my mind, failed to answer that question adequately.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She suggested that someone else put to her the range of figures of five to 12 per cent. It is important to contrast the minister's answers today and on other occasions concerning this matter, in terms of what she said here and what has been said outside. It is quite abundantly clear to me that she has used the range of five to 12 per cent as the figure for any proposed cut. We have already seen in terms of the Expenditure Review Committee decisions from April that proposals are being made and acted upon for cuts of that magnitude; that is if we are to take any notice at all of what the press has been saying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we can say with quite simple clarity is that a person she has quoted at length, the AVCC Executive Director, Frank Hambly, at 12.30 today at a meeting with the education committee of the Senate said that the minister did use the figure of 12 per cent. It is quite clear in terms of what she said here and what Frank Hambly has said about these proposals that the minister is terribly mistaken. The vice&hyphen;chancellors are not happy about being called a pack of liars.</PARA></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is absolutely right. Furthermore, Senator Vanstone indicated in discussions with me on Thursday that I should check with Frank Hambly as to what he has been saying on this matter. In this week's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Campus Review</EMPHASIS>  Frank Hambly is quoted as saying:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister certainly made it clear that there had been no decision taken on the level of any cuts but we came away from the meeting with the impression that it would be 5 to 12 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>I asked the executive director of the AVCC, `Was that an accurate and direct quote?' He has informed me today that that is the case. What he has indicated is his very deep concern on behalf of all the vice&hyphen;chancellors across the country. There is a great deal of anxiety and worry about the proposed reductions in funding. He has indicated to the education committee that cuts to the operating grants would lead to very significant reductions either in student numbers or course quality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He has indicated quite clearly that this would be a complete breach of the commitments and promises entered into by this coalition in the run&hyphen;up to the election. Cuts of this size would lead to quality reductions and reductions in class sizes or course options. Faculties may well be forced to close. Universities may be going to the wall at various regional levels. We will see great impact on the questions of access and equity for students across this country if such cuts are allowed to proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister may well have been suggesting tactically that 12 per cent is appropriate. Despite what she says here&mdash;I suggest she is coming very close to misleading the Senate on this issue&mdash;it may well be the case that she is hoping that if the cut is below 12 per cent, somehow we will accept that and be grateful for it. I ask a very simple question: why is it that defence is treated in one way&mdash;I have no real difficulties with that, given the strategic importance of defence&mdash;and education treated in another? Should not the same arguments apply to education as those exempting the defence budget from budget cuts?</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You are making such a mess of government that we do not know which target to shoot at each day&mdash;there are so many. In the first answer Senator Short gave today on the main question on the Telstra issue, he made no mention of the parliamentary route; he bumbled around trying to explain that there was this other option. I happened to notice later in question time in the Senate that we got a different sort of answer from Senator Alston.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things that was most striking in my supplementary question, when I asked about the estimation of how much stamp duty would be forgone by going the non&hyphen;legislative route, was that the estimates that are around now are well in excess of $1 billion. This is extraordinary. Here we are being told that this legislation is so important because we could get $1 billion for the environment, yet if the government goes the non&hyphen;legislative route just to privatise Telstra they will forgo that billion dollars that will have to be paid in stamp duty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know it is no longer really an issue about the environment; it is an ideologically driven issue for the coalition to privatise Telstra, irrespective of the billion dollars for the environment. They would have to forgo a billion dollars. That is why in your Telstra bill you exempt the payment of stamp duty. If you go through the legislative route, you <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> exempt yourself from stamp duty. You also exempt yourself from the corporations power of the Australian Securities Commission so you do not have to fulfil the normal prospectus requirements of a company in the private sector that is being established for the first time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are all natural things to do when you are privatising a company through a legislative route. But if you go the non&hyphen;legislative route, you have all those extra costs. You will reduce the price of Telstra from what you would get through the legislative route&mdash;if you could convince parliament. You won't be getting $8 billion. If you did get anywhere near it, we are advised, you would have to pay a billion dollars plus on stamp duty alone. That wipes out the money you would have for the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are getting down to the bottom line: this government is not privatising Telstra to help the environment; it is privatising it for an ideologically driven reason because it does not believe there is any value in public ownership, even for an asset for the Australian people like Telstra. It is about time that the government comes clean and tells the Australian people, `We are going to privatise no matter what.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final point I will make on this issue is that this advice was not sought during last week when the bill was sent off to the Senate committee. We have been advised that this advice was sought in March of this year within two or three weeks of the new government being sworn in&mdash;long before the parliament had started, long before you had even produced the bill or introduced it into this parliament. You are already preparing another way for what would be the greatest scam on the Australian people: the privatisation of Telstra by stealth so that somewhere along the line you can achieve your ideological objectives.</PARA>

Indications are that the States and Territories are willing to commit in excess of $40 million of additional funds to this end.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is still a great deal of work to be done before the new arrangements can take effect. It is imperative that the new legislation be passed as soon as possible to cater for the long lead time that is required in such an undertaking, particularly in the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1124"> context of Commonwealth-State relations. All parties need to know the precise level of support that will be made available so that levels of per capita funding, Transitional Funding, Strategic Results Projects funding and capital funding can be determined. If the passage of the bill is held over until the Spring Sitting it will create a great deal of uncertainty and hesitancy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill contains an element of $7.85 million for Strategic Results Projects in 1996 and some Departments of Education have already lodged bids for these funds to undertake strategic projects for which they will share the costs. If the bill does not go through in the Winter Sitting the progress towards achieving better educational outcomes will be seriously delayed.</PARA>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">STATEMENT OF REASONS FOR INTRODUCTION AND PASSAGE DURING THE 1996 WINTER SITTINGS</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill is a technical corollary to the new Customs Tariff Act 1995 (Act No. 147 of 1995), which passed the Parliament in the 1995 Spring Sittings with bi-partisan support.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Customs Tariff Act 1995, which will commence on 1 July 1996, implements over 500 tariff classification changes to the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System of the World Customs Organization. The passage of the Act last year, providing an effective 6 months lead time before its commencement was necessary to enable the importing community to make the necessary computer and documentary changes resulting from the new Tariff Act. It has also enabled the checking and revalidation of 120,000 tariff advices on the tariff classification of goods.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current Customs Tariff Act 1987 will be repealed by Part 3 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 with effect from 1 July 1996. There are several Commonwealth Acts and Regulations which presently contain references to the Customs Tariff Act 1987, including references to sections of that Act and to items, subitems, headings and subheadings of Schedules to that Act. It is necessary to legislatively update all references to the provisions of that Act to ensure the continued effectiveness of these references. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are also several types of instruments, such as by-laws and Tariff Concession Orders, which contain references to the provisions of the Customs Tariff Act 1987. As a majority of these instruments are intended to continue in effect for the purposes of the new Tariff Act, it is necessary in this Bill to enact a transitional provision to apply to these instruments. In the absence of such a provision, all these instruments will lapse on the commencement of the new Tariff on 1 July 1996.</PARA>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the Airports Bill is to establish the regulatory arrangements to apply to the Federal Airports following leasing of the airports to private operators. The purpose of the Airports (Transitional) Bill is to implement a framework to effect the sale of Federal Airports under long term leases.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is essential that the Airports Bill, in conjunction with the Airports (Transitional) Bill, be considered in the Winter parliamentary sittings to ensure that the Government's airport leasing program, a significant part of the Government's economic reforms and an important contributor to the Government's Budget strategy, is not unduly delayed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The leasing of the airports is expected to generate a significant offset to outlays in the forthcoming financial years. Airports cannot be leased until the regulatory and sales legislative arrangements are in place. Importantly formal market testing cannot commence until the release of an Information Memorandum in early October 1996 which is dependant upon the passage of both bills. Delay will put at risk the Government's ability to lease any Federal Airports in 1996-97.</PARA>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the election initiatives announced by the Government was that the newly arrived resident's waiting periods that apply before a person may be paid certain social security payments was to be extended from 26 weeks to 104 weeks. As a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1125"> general rule, the initiative is to apply to a person arriving in Australia on or after 1 April 1996 or who is granted a permanent visa on or after 1 April 1996, whichever is later. Legislation needs to be in place as soon as possible to give effect to that initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill would also go some way to addressing concerns expressed by employers about inefficient bureaucratic processes. Amendments to both the Social Security Act 1991 and the Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973 would facilitate a more efficient information gathering process from employers and other third parties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments would be made to the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act 1990 to ensure that income data from up to the two financial years immediately before the current financial year may be used in a single data-matching program.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Introduction and passage of the above Bill in the next session of Parliament is crucial to give necessary effect to the above measures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Bill is not given introduction and passage status by 30 June 1996 the ATO will be unable to implement these measures in time for commencement on 1 July 1996. This is important for these measures as they will vitally affect taxpayers in making commercial and personal decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment to the provisional tax uplift factor is needed to give effect to a Government election commitment. Additionally, the ATO needs to be sure that the measure will apply from 1 July 1996 so that essential computer and administrative systems alterations can be made by that time to implement the change. If the change is to operate from a later date then the existing systems will need to remain in place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The share buy back amendments were announced in the Budget and were to commence on 9 May 1995. These amendments therefore affected relevant transactions occurring on or after that time. Immediate implementation is necessary to provide certainty in the application of the law to these transactions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the gift provisions of the income tax laws are required to give effect to the announcements by the previous Government in relation to 5 funds or organisations.

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill amends the Indigenous Education (Supplementary Assistance) Act 1989 to provide improved arrangements for grants of financial assistance to be made to the state and territory governments, non&hyphen;government school systems and indigenous education institutions. The aim of this bill is to facilitate increased participation and improved education outcomes for indigenous Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current act provides funding to 30 June 1997. This bill amends the funding level for the period 1 January 1996 to 30 June 1997 and establishes funding levels up to 30 June 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These funding levels reflect an increase of $7.85 million on the existing appropriation for 1996, and establish the commonwealth's commitment under this act for each year of the third triennium of the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Funding under the act is appropriated on a triennial calendar year basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government intends to make major changes to the Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program from January 1997, with a new funding triennium to commence at that time. The restructuring of the Aboriginal education strategic results program will accelerate development of culturally appropriate indigenous education services under rigorous outcomes&hyphen;focused accountability arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In terms of program administration those changes will establish a more cost&hyphen;effective, more transparent, more manageable, and&mdash;critically&mdash;a more accountable process for the distribution of commonwealth funds. Parties to an indigenous education agreement will receive funding in two ways; either by way of a per capita entitlement basis, or on the basis of strategic results projects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both elements will focus on ensuring that the program is a "value for money" program which achieves improved educational outcomes for indigenous Australians. This will mean negotiating a higher level of educational accountability for these commonwealth funds. The supplementary funding from the Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program is the commonwealth's principal program for indigenous education.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The per capita element of the Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program will provide an entitlement based, equitable, recurrent funding arrangement. It will recognise the different resource bases of education providers as well as accommodating the higher costs of education provision in remote areas and in some sectors. Such acknowledgment is a prerequisite for establishing outcomes&hyphen;based accountability arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The element known as the "strategic results projects" will provide funding required to undertake priority projects of national significance that will <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1130"> contribute to achieving policy goals by 2001. Such projects, in order to receive commonwealth funding, must demonstrate that they deal with major barriers to educational attainment such as high drop&hyphen;out rates and low retention rates. These projects will remove barriers to attainment that cannot be addressed by mainstream programs. Projects will be for a specific period of time, will have specified purposes, outcomes and targets, and will be subject to an accountability system which will focus much more than in the past on the monitoring and reporting of improved educational outcomes rather than just financial inputs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The implementation of such rigorous accountability measures will ensure a comprehensive improvement in the achievement of goals for reducing the educational disadvantage of indigenous Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many factors contribute to that educational disadvantage. The identification of the causes of such high levels of educational disadvantage is complex. In acknowledging this complexity the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy reflects the importance of a cooperative, collaborative effort to develop more effective processes for education for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. The policy is based on the principle of shared effort and shared responsibility with state and territory governments in consultation with indigenous people. The tripartite nature of this partnership is a key component of the determination to achieve better outcomes from all sectors of indigenous education.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 1994 review of the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy found that between 1989 and 1993 the percentage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students staying on to year 12 of school increased from 14 per cent to about 33 per cent. During the same period, the number of indigenous students attending university doubled.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite such encouraging improvements in educational outcomes  indigenous people remain the most educationally disadvantaged group in Australia. From preschool right through to university, Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders participate and attain significantly less in education than their non&hyphen;indigenous peers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, at primary school level, three times as many indigenous students have literacy and numeracy problems as do other primary students.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At secondary school level, 25 per cent of indigenous students leave school before completing year 10, compared to 2 per cent of other Australians. The year 12 retention rate for indigenous students is 33 per cent, compared to 76 per cent for other Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The importance of quality education is clear. These amendments to the Indigenous Education (Supple <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> mentary Assistance) Act will provide funding to improve education opportunities and outcomes for indigenous people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Economic efficiency and social justice concerns require education to provide a basic foundation of opportunity for all people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is agreement within the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs, following reaffirmation of its commitment to the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy, that states and territories will set literacy, numeracy and employment targets in their indigenous education agreements for Aboriginal education strategic initiatives funding in the next triennium. These are key issues requiring increased effort and rigorous monitoring of strategies to ensure their success.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Efforts will also be concentrated on the early childhood education years to ensure better outcomes in literacy and numeracy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will also be efforts to concentrate on the employment of indigenous people at all levels of the education and training industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is recognised that, to achieve improved outcomes, strategies will need to address other key issues including:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> involving Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander parents in their children's education</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The level of improvement evident in some sectors of indigenous education has to become more consistent across the whole provision of education services for indigenous Australians. The rate of improvement must be accelerated. Not only will such improvement bring about important benefits for individuals and the entire indigenous community, it will also play a major part in the national reconciliation agenda. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1131"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments will, through the restructuring of the Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program, contribute to ensuring that such improvements are achieved in indigenous education.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the order of the Senate of 29 November 1994, relating to the consideration of legislation, not apply to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 1996.</PARA>
<PARA>It is important that this exemption be given because these amendments must pass during the session or it will be too late to apply them to the ATSIC October elections. They are already in train and the amendments that we propose have three key components. They are: to continue the current practice of the minister appointing two commissioners to the ATSIC board and the chairman, to reduce the size of regional councils and to give the minister the power to appoint an administrator to ATSIC under certain defined circumstances which are in the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are also a number of other key amendments which in the majority are being supported by ATSIC and which are based on the recommendations of an electoral review panel set up by the previous minister. The former Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs established this panel under section 141 of the act. Some of these recommendations require changes to the act. Section 383 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act permits the Australian Electoral Commission to seek an injunction to restrain a person from contravening or committing an offence against the act or another Commonwealth law applying to elections.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ATSIC act contains no specific provision equivalent to section 303 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act and this hampers the effect of the running of ATSIC elections by the AEC. It is proposed to amend <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the act to include a specific provision to allow for the Australian Electoral Commission to have injunctive powers in relation to ATSIC elections.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to that, another amendment will give greater stability to the position of deputy chairman by allowing for the election of the deputy chairman after board elections only and not, as at present, after every zone election. There is also an amendment to provide consistency in the election of deputy chairmen for regional councils and the commission. There is another amendment that will make regional council meetings open to the public and therefore more accountable to the community. A further amendment will bring regional counsellors into line with local government in relation to financial interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, there is an amendment to create statutory interest for ATSIC, TSRA and the Indigenous Land Council in land that they have funded. This entails having a caveat put on the material that defines ownership so that it cannot be sold without the intended purchaser being aware of the presence of that caveat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there are a number of amendments which are supported by ATSIC that will lead to openness and accountability, which ATSIC also supports. It is the wish of the government that these amendments apply to the ATSIC elections in October. If this bill does not go through, then it will not apply. As I mentioned, ATSIC supports many of the amendments and considers that the amendments it is agreeable to should apply for the October elections. If this legislation is not granted exemption from inter&hyphen;sessional rule, it may be that it will apply from after the ATSIC elections. That would hardly be fair to candidates who may be encouraged to stand for or discouraged from standing for those elections.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to indicate that the Greens (WA) oppose this motion to exempt this particular piece of ATSIC legislation on the principle that a bill should be introduced in one session and debated in the next. We appreciate the fact that it may present difficulties in the time line to the ATSIC elections, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1132"> which the minister has referred to. However, we do not believe that that is a sufficient excuse to allow for matters which have not received adequate consultation throughout the Aboriginal community in Australia to be put into the legislation. If this bill were exempted from the cut-off motion, it may well be that at least parts of it or the whole of it may be rejected. So the time line difficulties may well still operate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It might behove the government to have a look at some of the time line difficulties in the elections and to present a different bill, which might address issues that have been canvassed within ATSIC and the wider Aboriginal community separate from other matters&mdash;such as the appointment of an administrator and the giving of enormous powers&mdash;that deal with the bureaucratic level of ATSIC functioning. My understanding is that this matter was going to be deferred until tomorrow, because all parties have not been able to consider the implications of immediately exempting the legislation and dealing with it in this place. If that occurs, I will be happy to see the matter deferred. But I want to put on the public record that the reasons given so far are in no way satisfactory to the Greens.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think when the committee last adjourned I was in full flight and I was stopped at that point. I have been hovering ever since, waiting to get back into full flight, and this is the opportunity to do so. What my full flight was about was describing the opposition's attitude to the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1). If I may, I will just briefly recap what I was saying. That will summarise our position and it will save some chamber time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This customs and excise tariff bill refers to the diesel fuel rebate scheme. I noticed that got another run in this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, with the NFF apparently making claims to the government about how the scheme should be changed and that greater rebates under the scheme be provided to farmers. Be that as it may, that is another matter. It is not a matter related to this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a bill which I, as a minister in the former government, voted for in cabinet and the then government placed on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>. It was debated here and amended here, and finally it lapsed when the election was called. The current government has now brought it back in the same form as the former government would have done, except for one clause, had it remained in office. The opposition supports all the other clauses of the bill. When we were in government we presented those clauses to this chamber. We do not resile from that. We will support them when this government, the new government, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1133"> presents them here. But the new clause that has been tacked on gives us some difficulty. In my second reading address to the chamber, I made some remarks about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current situation before us is that both the Greens and, in anticipation, the Australian Democrats have amendments to move. The opposition's position is that the very purpose of this bill is to close loopholes that have been litigated over at the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, which has extended the original meaning of the bill&mdash;which has meant that people whom the government had not intended could claim the diesel fuel rebate can claim it. So this is a piece of necessary but good housekeeping to keep the definition within check. We would have done it, as I have said, but we did not, and now the new government is doing it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The debate here, though, is about limestone and limestone quarrying being included for the purposes of combating soil acidification on farms. I referred to that in my second reading address and in essence raised some questions about the purpose of it. Being aware of the Greens' amendment, I raised some of the opposition's concerns as to the constitutionality of the amendments and the drafting of them. I noticed that Senator Margetts, in her speech to the chamber, directly addressed those concerns, and I am bound to take note of her remarks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What she also referred to and what I have identified in this debate, as has my colleague on this side Senator Schacht, is the difficulty in a self-assessment situation of working out how we track limestone that leaves the quarry gate for the purposes of attracting this rebate as opposed to limestone that leaves the quarry gate for other purposes. That is still a matter of some concern and trouble. To that point the Greens' amendment is addressed. That shifts the whole onus from this bill to the tax act and would have to be dealt with in that forum. The opposition's point of view is that, while we have, as I have rightly indicated in the debate thus far, some reservations about that, we are in sympathy with the objectives of what the Greens are trying to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular, how we track the limestone post&hyphen;quarry gate in order to ensure that it is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> used for soil de-acidification is the problem. Self-assessment is a way of doing it, but it is not a very effective way. It seems to me that the very loopholes that this bill was designed to close are being reopened by this change. I can hear the patter of tax avoiders' feet as they run off to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in the wake of this change to seek ways in which they can widen the loophole. So we in the opposition will support the amendment of the Greens on the basis that we want to tie down to a greater extent the issues of constitutionality and drafting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Margetts has said, it may well be that the other chamber will reflect upon what we have decided here and find a better and more effective way of handling it. That may well be. If they do, so be it&mdash;an effective change will have been made. If they do not and they return the bill to this chamber, at that time we will deal with it again on its merits. I just wanted to make the point that that is where we stand with respect to the amendment that has been moved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments that are foreshadowed but have not yet been moved, the amendments in the name of Senator Spindler from the Australian Democrats, are about changing the definitions part of this bill so that uranium is defined as a non-mineral and therefore uranium mining would not be eligible for the diesel fuel rebate. Two start&hyphen;up dates are given for that. The opposition will be supporting neither of those amendments.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I respond to both Senator Margetts and Senator Cook, I would like to say that last Wednesday Senator Schacht asked me whether any other areas involving quarrying were acceptable as a legitimate claim for the diesel fuel rebate. The answer, as I understand it, is no.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">ACS has advised that any quarrying operation involving the extraction of mineral contained in the material is eligible for rebate. The extraction of silica, rutile, kaolin, bentonite or other minerals by quarrying is eligible for the rebate. The extraction of sand, unless for mineral sands, sandstone, soil, clay, slate other than bentonite or kaolin, basalt, granite, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1134"> gravel, limestone or water is not eligible for the diesel fuel rebate unless they are being used to extract a mineral. Similarly, quarrying operations carrying on solely for the purpose of obtaining stone for building, road making or similar purposes are not eligible. I hope that clarifies it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In bringing to a close the committee stage of this bill, I want to make a few comments in relation to the matters raised last week and today by Senator Cook. Senator Margetts, in moving her amendment&mdash;the effect of which is to deny eligibility for rebate for diesel fuel which is used for the extraction of limestone in the de-acidification of soil in agriculture&mdash;introduces an alternative which proposes to extend the income tax act to provide a cash rebate for landcare activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Margetts's proposal is not costed. One of the early lines of questioning in this place by the opposition, by Senator Cook and Schacht, was: what was the method used to determine the costing process involved? The proposal that Senator Margetts has put up is not costed. We have no idea what the cost will be. I mentioned last week in reply to Senator Margetts and Senator Cook that the activity which is now proposed in the government's addition to this bill is specifically targeted to an activity which will ensure that the costs of lime will not increase to farmers. That is its purpose. This is achieved by the diesel fuel legislation defining the eligible activities for which rebate is payable. That was the reform the previous government introduced in the legislation last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The activity of mining for minerals, or the extraction in the case of limestone from the ground, is made eligible under paragraph A of the definition of `mining operations'. In addition, the removal of overburden, which I mentioned last week, is also expressly defined in the legislation as an eligible activity. Whether or not a diesel fuel claimant claims that all the diesel fuel purchased was used for an eligible activity is a matter that the scheme handles through the claim process and the audit controls that accompany it. In addition, the claimant is required to nominate the eligible activity which he or she is relying upon to claim the rebate. If the activity does <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not come within one of the express activities under the definition of mining operations there is no entitlement for rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Cook last week indicated that the opposition would now be supporting the Green amendment. The hypocrisy is obvious. While the senator was critical of the government for our costing, he is now claiming&mdash;and the opposition is claiming&mdash;to support an amendment which goes much further than the government's addition and for which no costings are available.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DX5">Senator MARGETTS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was talking about the same levels as are available. I have mentioned that in my speech as well in terms of the level of income which will be assessed and the rates at which it is assessed. So there is no difference in the revenue implications because it is the same as is currently available under deductibility. The only difference is&mdash;for the sake of what farmers have been asking for a long time&mdash;a recognition that in a series of bad years having to wait three or four years for a year when your income is high enough to be assessed in order to claim that deductibility is an extraordinary thing to ask farmers to do if what we are saying as a parliament and as a Senate is that we believe landcare activities should be deductible and it is an entitlement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that we are allowing them to roll that entitlement over indicates that we do believe it is an entitlement that they should be able to claim. The only difference is that we <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1135"> are suggesting that to encourage landcare activities, especially in bad years and especially in those years perhaps when the strain on land may be greater, this is the right thing to do to enable that capital expenditure in bad years as well as good years to be claimed in that year rather than have to wait perhaps several years and perhaps discourage the expenditure when it is needed most. So there is no extra entitlements. We are assuming that the intent is that we want to encourage farmers. If it means that some extra farmers will make a decision to take on landcare activities, presumably that would have a positive spin-off. It means that assistance, unemployment benefit and other things that may ensue from people degrading their land during bad seasons or the extra family assistance that is required may not occur. I suppose this might encourage more people to take up some landcare activities but in the end you would have to say that this is surely what we are after. This may well bring about a reduction in the amount of revenue that the Commonwealth needs to pay out later when we are thinking of ways of supporting farmers who are in dreadful straits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there is no more ability to claim than is currently the case. It is just in terms of a rebate rather than a deductibility and in the end that expenditure is deductible, whether it is one year, two years, three years or four years down the track. So basically we are not giving anything extra to the entitlement that exists now.</PARA></SPEECH>

From my understanding of what she said she knows nothing about the tax act. She was saying that farmers spending for environmental reasons or fixing up land degradation should have a rebate. In my book, a rebate, rather than a tax deduction against income, is at a fixed rate. It is the same for all taxpayers. There are plenty of examples right across the tax act of that&mdash;keeping everyone on the same plane. It does not matter what your income is.

Senator, what our amendment did was allow people mining limestone for agricultural purposes to get a diesel fuel rebate. What you have done&mdash;and this is why I say it is not costed; it does not match&mdash;is use an addition to section 75D of the taxation act. Section 75D(1B)(c) of the act spells out `an operation primarily and principally for the purpose of preventing or combating land degradation otherwise than by the erection of fences on the subject land'.

If you are concerned about land care and the ability of farmers to use lime for de&hyphen;acidification of soil, maybe one of the best ways of assuring that any time they use anything including lime for land care is that they then make sure that they are not out of pocket in that year to the extent that they might be if they do not have sufficient income to be taxable.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I come somewhat late to this debate, and I missed the second reading because I was overseas on parliamentary business but I do want to make a small contribution. Because of other meetings I have not had the opportunity to hear all of Senator Margetts's argument in favour of the amendment she proposes. From what I picked up in the last three minutes, it does seem to me that she is talking about a tax deductibility or a cash rebate as a form of tax instead of deducting the diesel fuel rebate at the time it is incurred.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If what I pick up is correct, what that would do, as I understand it, is make it less attractive to people who need to use the lime for addressing the acidity of soil. For those farmers who are not in receipt of an income, sure, they would get the cash rebate back later but it would be a long way down the track. It could be 18 months away, whereas the rebate, as Senator Parer points out, is instantaneous. As I understand it&mdash;perhaps you will correct me, Senator Margetts; perhaps I am wrong&mdash;that would make it less attractive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This particular amendment that the government has picked up is one that I would urge Senator Margetts and all senators to support. Senator Margetts will be aware of the long history of this amendment. The Australian Labor Party did not want anything to do with this at all. In fact, when Senator Schacht was the minister, he refused to countenance it, despite the fact we pointed out both in this chamber and at various committee hearings that 35 million hectares of soil in Australia are highly acidic, another 55 million hectares are moderately or slightly acidic and that the cost of that acid soil to Australia means a hell of a lot to our export earnings as well as the straight environmental concern that no doubt many senators do have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been said by the National Farmers Federation that this was perhaps the greatest environmental problem facing Australia and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1137"> yet the Labor government would not countenance it. In spite of all these facts and in spite of all the arguments we were able to produce, they would not have a bar of it. I might let you into a little secret on the coalition side. Initially, the coalition did not want to fiddle around with this either. They saw that there was some cost to the revenue and they did not want to do it. The coalition leadership was persuaded to allow this. It was not without a lot of argument, and some of my colleagues will smile when I say that; but the coalition eventually agreed to do this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I would say to Senator Margetts: please do not put this in jeopardy. If your amendment did get up, it would delay the passage of this bill. It would go back to the House of Representatives and who knows what they would do with it there&mdash;and nothing may ever happen. I understand your argument is based on the fact that there could be rorts. I have not been around to hear your arguments and I am not quite sure what you are talking about there. But even if there are some rorts, as Senator Parer says, the upper limit of this, as we have it, is $600,000.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Margetts is obviously with the government in promoting its assistance for soil deacidification. Although she agrees with our thrust and she would be, like us, very critical of the Labor Party previously in government when they would not countenance this at all, she obviously has a concern about <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the administration and that there may be rorts. I accept her concerns as genuine and I accept that she has gone to a lot of trouble to try to find a better way of doing it. All I can say is that the government obviously does not agree with her.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government are intent on maintaining their administrative method of doing things. I would ask Senator Margetts in that instance if she would support us to get the thrust of it done, to get the legislation through so that those who do want to use lime to help in the deacidification of soils can do so to treat what is almost unquestionably Australia's greatest environmental problem and not be penalised for doing it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No doubt many of my colleagues have raised many matters in support of the amendment. Evidence was given to us in committee hearings last year by a lot of miners who were extracting the limestone. They gave evidence of the enormous extra costs that would be involved for those wishing to use lime for deacidification purposes and the fact that those additional costs would make it unattractive and would add to the environmental degradation of our soils.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, for all those reasons, I very much support, in a very grateful way, the provision of this legislation that includes limestone in the rebates available for those extracting limestone for use in the deacidification of soil.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Health Legislation (Powers of Investigation) Amendment Bill 1996 proposes an amendment to the Health Legislation (Powers of Investigation) Amendment Act 1994 and the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Act (No. 3) 1995. The amendment&mdash;as I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security, Senator Kemp, will say&mdash;deletes the sunset clause in the two items of legislation to allow them to continue in effect after 1 July this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition supports this legislation as it allows useful and advantageous legislation, which was part of our legislative program, to continue in force. I suppose it should be noted that, in effect, what this government is doing is endorsing part of the program of the previous Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Act (No. 3) 1995 made amendments to finetune the Labor government program in three areas: the Childcare Rebate Act 1993, the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973 and the National Health and Medical Research Council Act 1992. It also made a range of technical amendments to a range of other legislation within the health portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Health Legislation (Powers of Investigation) Amendment Act 1994, in the main, improved the capacity of the Health Insurance Commission to investigate fraud under Medicare. This was done by increasing the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> length of time that evidence obtained under a search warrant could be retained and allowed the commission to have direct access to the DPP, rather than having to go through the Federal Police. That legislation also made some adjustments to the National Health Act 1953 which regulates the administration of nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sunset clause which the bill before us will delete was originally recommended by the Senate legal and constitutional committee as a safeguard to ensure that the Health Insurance Commission did not abuse its extended investigatory powers. It seems that there is no evidence of this being the case; in fact, it appears the contrary is true.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian National Audit Office has prepared a report on the HIC's use of the new investigatory powers, and it has concluded that the commission has acted in accordance with the enabling act and the Privacy Act 1988. I make a quick reference to the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Impact of sunset clause on investigatory powers</EMPHASIS>, which was tabled last week and which I have had an opportunity to have a good look at. It concludes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the enhanced powers to investigate fraud and excessive servicing have improved the Commission's ability to conduct investigations and prepare prosecutions. The ANAO considers that without powers of this kind the ability of the Commission to conduct investigations and prepare prosecutions would be impaired.</PARA>
<PARA>This view has been supported by stakeholders consulted during the audit. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Commission is using the enhanced powers in accordance with the legislation and in a professional manner.</PARA>
<PARA>Certainly, with this ringing endorsement of the previous bill, I am very happy to concur with the government in removing the existing sunset clauses.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8U4">Senator LEES</NAME>
<STATE> (South Australia&mdash;</STATE>
<ROLE>Deputy Leader of the Australian Democrats)</ROLE>
<TIME.STAMP>(5.00 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Democrats strongly supported the Health Services (Powers of Investigation) Amendment Bill when it came before this place in 1993. That legislation followed on from two reports to the Labor government calling for a beefing&hyphen;up of the powers of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1140"> Health Insurance Commission to better enable the commission to tackle medical fraud and overservicing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the time the legislation passed through the Senate, the Democrats said that they really did not see any point in this sunset clause, which was moved by the then opposition. I think it was Senator Newman who moved it. The legislation went through and we are here today removing that clause. We are certainly supporting its removal. We said at the time that we felt the sunset clause was being put in because of some concerns voiced by some who were very active in the medical profession. I note that I have since heard nothing from them about this legislation. It means either that the power is working extremely well or perhaps that the power has been used rather sparingly and that it needs to work a little bit more. I will move on to that later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> If we look at some of the results, I do not think anyone can argue that the Health Insurance Commission has been overusing the authority that was given to it. The National Audit Office, which carried out the 1992-93 audit of the commission's investigations of abuses of medical and health services, has now carried out a performance audit of progress since the 1993 legislation was enacted. It has found that the commission is using its enhanced powers in accordance with the legislation and the Privacy Act. The audit office also says that the powers have allowed the commission to investigate effectively offences against health legislation and to prepare briefs for prosecutions. The audit office notes that the extent of fraud and overservicing is still far from clear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The commission is developing the methodology and programs needed to provide an accurate and current estimate of the extent of fraud and overservicing. The audit office intends to examine the effectiveness of the commission's approach later in the year. I look forward to that second phase of the audit, because there does seem to be, as I have said, some room for improvement in the actual investigation of fraud and overservicing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that the audit office did not consult with key stakeholders in carrying out its <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> performance audit and that,  far from complaining about the use of the new powers, some organisations actually criticised the continuing lack of results. The audit office reported:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . several organisations stated they had reported apparent offences to the Health Insurance  Commission and had yet to see any action.</PARA>
<PARA>It will be interesting to see the results of the second phase of the audit but, for the time being, the audit office is fairly clear in its assertion that the enhanced powers are greatly assisting the commission to achieve results.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the legislation came into existence, the commission has exercised its new powers on a number of occasions. It has authorised 41 investigations, issued 171 notices and issued 23 warrants. Ten cases involving these powers have been to court, and four have led to successful prosecutions, with the remainder still being processed. While I think some of the criticism made at the time of the original legislation was valid, and there certainly were very genuine concerns, I believe things are changing for the better. I hope the government will continue the previous Labor government's efforts to crack down on this type of fraud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I just want to outline a couple of brief issues, related to this legislation, that arose out of a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program a few weeks ago on the overservicing and over&hyphen;medication by doctors of people who are residents in nursing homes. That <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program&mdash;as anyone who watched it would have seen&mdash;really did paint a rather horrifying  picture of over&hyphen;medication of residents in nursing homes. Unfortunately, we do not seem to have had much of a response as yet from the government. Indeed, what response I have seen has been far from satisfactory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is fascinating that this government seems to be moving very quickly on supposed or suspected fraud in social security on the basis of, I would argue, very little evidence at all, if any. But here, when we have what I think is fairly compelling evidence, we have not really had much response other than a few vague comments. Recent research, unfortunately, backs up what that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program has told us.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1141">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government would have just received the report of the  quality of medication care project, which reviewed more than 3,300 nursing home residents in Queensland and New South Wales. The study found inappropriate levels of drug use and inadequate monitoring and supervision by general practitioners, and estimated that an overall reduction in drug use in nursing homes could save the taxpayers several millions of dollars a year. In the context of debate on this legislation, the obvious question is: where is the Health Insurance Commission in all of this? Perhaps that is a question the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Family Services (Senator Woods) can take on notice for later discussion when we get to the committee stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Just to go back to the report, it says that general practitioners often see individual residents for a mere six to 10 minutes a month and yet the average nursing home resident is being prescribed six different types of drugs at any one time. I have to ask the minister: isn't there some cause for concern? Senator Woods, can you perhaps give us some idea, as we move into the committee stage, as to whether or not the commission is in fact involved in this issue or, indeed, if it plans to start having a look at this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In closing, I simply say that I do believe the legislation we passed in 1993 has enabled the Health Insurance Commission to smarten up its act. We continue to believe in the merits of this legislation and will be supporting the removal of the sunset clause.</PARA></SPEECH>

<STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(5.07 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is presently considering the Health Legislation (Powers of Investigation) Amendment Bill 1996 which seeks to remove the sunset clauses which were put into two acts by the Senate when the investigation powers were given to the Health Insurance Commission. The investigation powers vested in the HIC are considerable and permit the commission to obtain information and conduct searches in order to monitor compliance with Medicare guidelines. The powers also enable the commission to execute search warrants and seize materials for the purposes of evidence. They are similar to the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> investigation powers of the Australian Federal Police and authorise the Health Insurance Commission officers, instead of the Australian Federal Police, to investigate medifraud.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Naturally, when large amounts of money are involved in government programs, it is crucial that checks and balances be put in place to ensure that fraud, mismanagement and other forms of corruption are strictly controlled. However, that statement does not lead to the inevitable conclusion that these powers and this means of enforcement are the only possibilities available to us. At the time these powers were put into place, the Senate debated at some length the implications for civil liberties and individual rights, and the possibility that the investigation powers could be abused.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Newman was a keen advocate for caution in relation to giving unfettered powers of a police nature to the Health Insurance Commission. Therefore, the Senate amended the then bills to incorporate the sunset clauses so that a thorough review of these powers could take place before they became a permanent feature of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe, therefore, that the history of the sunset clauses and the bill that we are considering at this time serve as a cautionary tale in relation to sunset clauses and the degree of scrutiny that is given when legislation has a sunset clause placed on it. In fact, it would seem very strange to an outside observer that within the first week of this parliamentary session we were asked to pass this bill. I may be wrong, but my memory tells me that it was even contemplated that this bill be dealt with within the non&hyphen;controversial legislation part of the program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were asked to pass this bill, remove the sunset clauses and assume that all was well. It seems strange because the report of the Australian National Audit Office on compliance aspects of the commission's work was not available to the Senate until the Friday before last, well after we were about to cough it through the Senate. That audit was a compliance audit and it indicated that the powers had been used strictly in accordance with the act. I would hope so!</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1142">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That alone should not be sufficient for us to simply sign off on the sunset clauses and let the commission have the powers forever. It could be argued that the very existence of the sunset clauses ensured compliance by the Health Insurance Commission with the exact letter of the law. The audit which was tabled the Friday before last looked at only one aspect: compliance. Unfortunately, the audit office did not consult a wider range of stakeholders in this matter. They asked those people who, in my view, would have some kind of stake in having those powers&mdash;for example, the Australian Medical Association. It is obviously in the interests of professionals within this area that any so&hyphen;called bad apples are weeded out and that they have powers to enforce the correct and proper behaviour within the profession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The notable omissions from the list of those consulted included the Doctors Reform Society and the Australian Comprehensive Medicine Association, to name but two. More surprisingly still, the audit team did not consult anyone who had been investigated. Surely, if the audit was to evaluate the use of the investigation powers, to see whether those powers had been abused, it would have made sense to consult those who had been the subject of the powers. Likewise, the patients of those who had been investigated might well have a valuable contribution to make on aspects of privacy and confidentiality. When the sunset clauses were introduced in the previous sitting of the Senate both aspects were raised as being of concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My office has received complaints from doctors who practise a combination of complementary therapies alongside orthodox medicine. We have also heard that, subsequent to the completion of this audit report, complaints have been received from somebody who had been under investigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other issue which the audit did not cover&mdash;and I have already said I have some concerns about the degree to which compliance was covered&mdash;but was not intended to cover was the efficiency and effectiveness of the investigation powers. At the time the investigation powers were introduced we were given estimates of the amounts of money <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which would  be saved by putting those powers in place. I believe that the Senate must properly evaluate the powers and properly consider whether or not the sunset clauses should come into effect. In order to do so, we should wait for the audit office to do the next stage audit, namely the efficiency and effectiveness audit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I received a briefing the other day from the audit office and the Health Insurance Commission. They indicated that the next stage of audit may not be completed for some time. I indicated to them that a 12&hyphen;month extension of the sunset clauses was something I was considering as an amendment. They assured me that within that 12&hyphen;month period, they should be able to carry out the next stage of the audit and present the results. I have circulated amendments to the bill which would extend the sunset clauses until 1 July 1997. I will be moving those amendments at the appropriate time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to continue my moralising on the cautionary tale of sunset clauses. The bill we are considering at the moment was not introduced in the previous session of parliament. It was exempted from the cut-off motion, against the vote of the Greens. That was done in order to rapidly implement, without any further consideration, the removal of the sunset clauses and the continuation of the considerable investigatory powers that have been bestowed on the Health Insurance Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been no plans, as far as I know, to monitor in an ongoing way or review the way in which these powers are being used. I have very serious objections to that. I believe that, if sunset clauses are imposed by this chamber, we have a responsibility to the community to give their impact more than just a cursory examination before removing them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is with considerable alarm that I note that we are probably proceeding to the stage where the majority vote in this chamber will remove the sunset clauses and thereby remove the capacity to act, in any way, on the next stage of audit that the Australian National Audit Office is set up to perform&mdash;namely, the efficiency and effectiveness stage. This <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1143"> also causes some concern, I believe, for those who may be the subject of investigation and may be further concerned about the compliance powers that have not actually been drawn to the attention of anybody in particular at this point in the history of these powers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude my remarks with this plea: if we are intending to put sunset clauses in place, this chamber should have a far more thorough investigation of and discussion into the removal of them. Otherwise, I do not think we should be voting on sunset clauses at all. This allows people who have serious concerns about this to have their concerns lulled and allows governments that want to push headlong into increasing these powers at some later stage to do so with the minimum of scrutiny.</PARA></SPEECH>

That report confirmed, as has been stated already, that the safety mechanisms employed by the HIC have ensured that the powers have been used correctly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By repealing section 2 of the Health Legislation (Powers of Investigation) Amendment Act 1994 and item 68 of schedule 1 of the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Act (No. 3) 1995, this legislation will enable the HIC to continue to conduct <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> investigations and prepare prosecutions against providers and practitioners who abuse the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Section 2 of the Health Legislation (Powers of Investigation) Amendment Act 1994 specifically provides that the entire act should cease to have force on and from 1 July 1996. The sunset clause resulted from concerns expressed before the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs that the broad&hyphen;ranging powers provided for in the act offered scope for corruption and abuse of delegated authority by officers of the HIC. It allowed for a reasonable period&mdash;roughly two years&mdash;for parliament to make a judgment about whether the powers had been abused in any way by the HIC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that no evidence of improper activity by the HIC has arisen during this period. Moreover, the conferred powers have clearly improved the commission's ability to effectively detect and deal with Medicare non&hyphen;compliance and fraud. It is, therefore, important that those powers now be preserved in order to give full effect to the role and the function of the HIC as a regulatory body over Medicare practices and fraud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, item 68 of schedule 1 of the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Act (No. 3) 1995 provides that item 66 and the amendments made by item 66 of schedule 1 of that act cease to be enforced from 1 July. Item 66 ensures procedural fairness in relation to the seizure of evidential materials for the purposes of investigating Medicare fraud and over&hyphen;servicing. It does so by imposing an obligation on authorised officers or officers assisting the commission to return material seized for the purposes of evidence in the course of conducting searches and investigations when the reason warranting the seizure no longer exists or a decision has been made not to use the material in evidence. This item, therefore, aims to protect the interests and privacy of a medical practitioner&mdash;and, therefore, his or her patients&mdash;who may come under investigation for fraud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill establishes that certain measures should be kept in place to allow the continued control and enforcement of compliance with Medicare benefit guidelines. This bill aims to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1144"> retain the delegation of powers which have proven, on a trial&hyphen;like basis, to be efficient, substantive and pertinent to the role of the HIC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the absence of any evidence that the powers delegated by the Health Legislation (Powers of Investigation) Amendment Act 1994 have been or are prone to being abused and distorted, the sunset clause incorporated into that act should be repealed. In order to preserve a follow&hyphen;on provision in the interests of fairness and individuals' rights, the sunset clause incorporated into the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Act (No. 3) 1995 which relates to item 66 should also be repealed. Without these amendments, the sunset clause will take effect on 1 July 1996 and seriously undermine the ability of the HIC to prevent, and prosecute against, Medicare fraud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of issues have been raised which I was going to address in the third reading, but I will address one or two of them at this point. Senator Lees raised some questions relating to nursing homes which were not specifically relevant. I think she used the terms `over&hyphen;servicing' as well as `over&hyphen;medication'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me address the over&hyphen;servicing issue. I have to say to you, Senator Lees, that the problem is not with the over&hyphen;servicing offered by medical practitioners to nursing homes; the problem is, as I think you said, quite the opposite. The problem is under&hyphen;servicing. I think you quoted the figure of six to 10 minutes per month. If there is a problem, it is not with over&hyphen;servicing for pecuniary gain; if anything, it is the inadequacy of that service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to point out at this stage that, although the nursing home industry has received a lot of criticism over the last few weeks for not achieving various outcomes&mdash;in particular, in relation to a series of articles in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald</EMPHASIS>&mdash;over&hyphen;medication is not the responsibility of the nursing home staff, nurses, proprietors or operators; it is the responsibility of the medical practitioners involved in the care of those patients. It is those doctors who control the prescribing and, therefore, the medication of the patients.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Lees asked how we are going to address this. There are a number of ways in which it can be addressed. Obviously, it does give rise to some concern. One way is that there will be a review of high prescribers in nursing homes. We are also looking at the role of review by pharmacists in a consultant role to see exactly what is possible to improve the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In response to the question about whether we are concerned, we are very concerned. Unfortunately&mdash;I use that word in the sense that it is slightly difficult for us to control as a government or as an authority&mdash;it is very much a responsibility of the individual medical practitioners in that particular area. I share your concerns. Fixing it is not easy, but we are addressing a number of ways to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is fair to say that, over the last 10 or 15 years, the standard of care in its broader sense in nursing homes has improved fairly significantly. I think it is also fair to say that the standard of medical care in many nursing homes&mdash;of course I do not want to include every nursing home in that category&mdash;has not improved at a comparable rate. I think that really is a priority which needs addressing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the issues which Senator Lees and Senator Chamarette raised and, firstly, the question of stakeholders which were consulted or not consulted, there were a number of organisations consulted&mdash;I think, eight or nine. Senator Chamarette raised a couple which were not consulted. One was the Doctors Reform Society. I think it is true that the National Audit Office did not consult either or any of the 10 members nationally of the Doctors Reform Society&mdash;I believe it is almost getting beyond double figures now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think the Doctors Reform Society can be seen to be a genuine group in this regard, other than as a lobby group for the Labor Party. But I have to say in all innocence and without scoring political points that the Australian Comprehensive Medical Association has never crossed my conscience. I do apologise for my ignorance in this matter. I think I am aware of most of the groups in the area. It probably does mean that it is not exactly, shall we say, mainstream. Without wishing in any way to be derogatory of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1145"> group, because I do not know anything about it, it is not the group which springs to mind when you are thinking of who you should consult to get a broad view about these sorts of issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand the reservation which Senator Lees expressed about the powers not being used as much as they might have been. I think that is a very valid comment. I think it is probably better at this stage of new legislation to be that way, to be too cautious, rather than to go the other way. I think it is not surprising that, if anything, the HIC has been cautious. I, for one&mdash;and I know from what Senator Chamarette said she would also support this&mdash;am happy that it is not overzealous in regard to the broad use of these powers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a range of concerns about what Senator Chamarette was suggesting we might do. We are now looking at a piece of legislation, the powers of which will disappear in a month's time. I think at one stage you suggested that we not do anything. If that were the case, then there would be no powers of investigation. With the best will in the world&mdash;and I don't want to in any way be critical&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, at one stage during your speech you will find that you were suggesting that we might just let the whole thing go and not do anything, in which case the whole thing will go into abeyance and there would not be any powers, which I have to say is supporting the crooks and the shonks in the profession. I know that is something you would never want to do, but that would be the end result of not taking this action.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You asked why it was so important to get this through as a priority and to get it exempt from the normal introductory mechanisms, there is the answer for you. It is because if we had not done that, then there would not be any powers in place at the end of June and, therefore, the crooks and shonks would be able to get away with that much extra, and that is something which I know none of us would want. I am not in any way suggesting that you are supporting the crooks and the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> shonks&mdash;I know you far better than that, Senator Chamarette. So that was why it was important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You also said that the evaluation of the sunset clause was cursory. With all due respect, that is just absolute rubbish. We have all got copies of the Australian National Audit Office evaluation. It has looked at the issue very carefully. There may be some minor criticism from some parties, but essentially the endorsement is ringing. I quote the summary of the ANAO's report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the enhanced powers to investigate fraud and excessive servicing have improved the Commission's ability to conduct investigations and prepare prosecutions. The ANOA considers that without powers of this kind the ability of the Commission to conduct investigations and prepare prosecutions would be impaired. This view has been supported by stakeholders consulted during the audit; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the Commission is using the enhanced powers in accordance with the legislation and in a professional manner.</PARA>
<PARA>If we do not continue to maintain these powers for the HIC, we will make it easier for the crooks and shonks to rip off the taxpayers of Australia. There is no question about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know how much of an evaluation of a sunset clause you can have. You had two years. There is no suggestion that it has been inappropriately used. Yet what you also said, I think, was that the audit office should have consulted with those who are being investigated. I have to say to you that almost all of those who were investigated&mdash;and I would not want to say all of them&mdash;were crooks, shonks or fiddling the system. Would they want to be investigated? Of course they wouldn't. Should we ask the crooks in the world whether the police should have a search warrant? I bet your bottom dollar they will say no. It is really a fairly crazy suggestion to say, `Let us ask the people who are really going to suffer inappropriately.' It is most inappropriate to ask those sorts of groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You mentioned the AMA. I think your assessment of the AMA was wrong. The AMA, as I recall, had major concerns about this legislation not because, as you said, it wanted to get rid of the bad apples&mdash;I am sure it does want to do that&mdash;it was concerned <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1146"> that it was going to be abused. But as Senator Lees mentioned, the voices of the AMA and other associations have been remarkably quiet, I think, indicating that they are happy with the way in which the legislation is being implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think your case for either not doing anything and thinking about it&mdash;that is, not giving the bill the priority, which you suggested&mdash;in which case the whole thing would disappear, or for putting another year sunset clause on it is very minimal indeed. I think this is a bill which clearly has worked well. If you like, I can give you all the figures of how many people have been caught and prosecuted. There is no doubt at all that it is a very useful tool which has not been abused, which has saved the taxpayers money and which has been used appropriately to attack the crooks, the shonks and the fiddlers in the system. I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA>The first amendment extends the sunset clause on the investigation powers to 1 July 1997. The aim of the amendment is, as I mentioned in the second reading debate, to allow time for the Australian National Audit Office to conduct an effectiveness and efficiency audit of the investigation powers. I believe that is an audit that they are about to commence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate should not simply put the powers in place permanently unless we can fully and properly evaluate whether the powers are worth while in terms of the claims made for them. The powers are there to allow the Health Insurance Commission to control <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> fraud and overservicing. If, however, the HIC is spending more on investigation than it is saving on fraud, or is only overcoming a fraction of its fraud estimate, then the Senate should call on the government to find another way to fulfil this function.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We cannot evaluate the powers without an assessment of their effectiveness. We are all familiar with the examples of claims being made for fraud control measures which are never matched by performance. I believe it was the Victorian medical practice defence committee&mdash;in their submission to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs&mdash;who raised a concern that the incorrect estimations by the HIC regarding fraud and overservicing could give them unjustified rights for power and also that the HIC may have provided misleading amounts of money and estimations regarding the amount of fraud and overservicing in the profession. The privacy issue was also mentioned by that committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The HIC powers were accompanied by estimates that some $69 million could be saved over the first two years of operation. We have had two years of operation and we have not yet had an audit to assess whether that kind of statement was inflated simply to obtain the powers, or whether it has been vindicated. Without the next stage of the audit process, we cannot hope to know how much has been saved or how much has been spent saving it. Therefore, we need to extend the review period which the sunset clause provides.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second amendment flows from the other as it pertains to certain matters relating to procedural fairness of the investigation powers. It is not strictly necessary for the second amendment to be passed, as putting item 66 in place permanently by removing the sunset clause would not have a material effect. However, this amendment would allow item 66 to continue in effect until such time as the investigation powers are properly evaluated. Should it then be decided to remove them, by allowing the sunset clause to take effect, item 66 would be unnecessary and could also be removed by means of a sunset clause. For those who are wondering about <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1147"> item 66, it is simply the clause relating to the return of material seized for the purpose of evidence in the course of conducting searches and investigations when the reason warranting the seizure no longer exists or a decision is made not to use the material in evidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The parliamentary secretary, Senator Woods, was quite scathing about my concerns. I believe his scathing comments were totally out of place, because it is the role of this chamber to ensure that it evaluates the provisions before removing the sunset clause. To rely on a document that is tabled after the bill is attempted to be pushed through and which is incomplete is not adequate conduct for this place. Senator Woods did not say this but I am sure that that if there had not been an election and we had had six months sitting of this parliament, we would have been able to have had the introduction of a bill and later on an endeavour to remove the sunset clauses following some kind of discussion within this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are dealing with this bill for the first time and we are removing the sunset clause which we put in place saying we, the Senate, need it. Rather than the audit office, the Senate needed the opportunity to see whether the community had concerns. To simply start dividing the community into elite groups and `crooks and shonks'&mdash;and to say that we listen only to elite groups and we do not listen to crooks and shonks&mdash;is utterly inadequate as a basis for asking us to rush this piece of legislation through this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For a start, if we want to have any credibility in the eyes of the community, the people who enforce laws have to be above reproach. We should not inflict, even on people who are subsequently charged with and convicted of offences, a lesser standard. We should be beyond reproach in relation to that. That is why it would have been appropriate to look not only at health commission compliance with the act but also at those people who were investigated and their clients in case there were some complaints regarding breaches of privacy of people who visit doctors' surgeries and breaches of protocol in the perception of the people who are being <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> charged, to see whether there were any aspects of their concerns that had merit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To say that we do not have to even look at them to see whether they do have merit is not something which I believe we should support in this place. When I was working in the prison system, many times people who were convicted of offences would come to me and say, `There is one law for criminals and there is another for the police. Police and people with higher powers are allowed to get away with things that we are not allowed to get away with.' I do not believe we should be supporting that. That is why we need to allow the voice of people who are being subjected to these powers to be heard when we are evaluating these powers and removing the sunset clause.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Woods implied, I would be happy to vote against these powers, let the matter lapse and go back to a position where we did not give the Health Insurance Commission the equivalent powers of the Australian Federal Police. However, that is not the purpose of this amendment. The purpose of this amendment is to allow a reasonable period to elapse&mdash;another 12 months&mdash;to make sure that the powers we are cementing into place at this time not only are being complied with but also are not having unintended consequences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not casting any aspersions on the motivations of the Health Insurance Commission or on the officers carrying out the powers. I am saying that we as the Senate should be evaluating the way that is impacting on the community and on the culture in the community before we so readily agree to the lifting of the sunset clause. So that is why I have proposed these amendments for there to be another 12 months. We can then, with full and clear consciences, vote to have the sunset clause removed, because we will have subjected it to the scrutiny it deserves.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to begin where Senator Chamarette left off, and that is the issue of urgency and whether or not we need to do this now or later. The reason this legislation was introduced in 1993 was that the previous <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1148"> system did not work. The HIC's investigative systems were fine; but, in passing things on to the Federal Police, something happened&mdash;everything seemed to go into a big basket somewhere where there was very little result in stopping the fraud and overservicing that was there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the time the legislation was going through I had a lot of representation from various groups in the health community that were concerned. The alternative practitioners were one group. Female general practitioners were another group, because they had different ordering practices in some areas, particularly in pathology, from men. Despite people coming to see me regularly during these few months&mdash;indeed, this afternoon in my office I had two different groups that you could best describe as health groups talking about different health issues&mdash;since this legislation was put in place no-one has come back to my office to complain. For us, that in itself says something&mdash;the fact that many of those groups that were genuinely concerned about many of the issues that Senator Chamarette has raised, including privacy, have not been back to see us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at the very small numbers of successful prosecutions, you will see that what is working is the general counselling and support for doctors whose practices might get a little red light flashing on some computer somewhere. That system seems to have been working.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That brings me to another aspect that Senator Chamarette mentioned: how much money are we saving? We are not going to see all the savings in terms of prosecutions and amounts recouped. If you sit with some people from pathology in particular and look at some of their overhead charts, you will see that some of the savings are actually made by doctors adopting different practices. It is very hard to quantify exactly how many ordering patterns have changed and how much they have changed; but, from the information provided to me, they certainly have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the years a number of things the government has done&mdash;and I am just thinking of pathology&mdash;have had an impact on particular habits and doctors have been re-educated <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to look at whether they really do need to order this block of tests or whether it is better to look at this particular test and have another particular approach to the use of some of the services. I say very clearly that the Democrats supported the government when they wanted this legislation in and to move that the cut-off not apply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We cannot support Senator Chamarette's amendments now, because we see the system working reasonably well. Indeed, while we acknowledge the need for the audit process, we do not see any reason to stop what is happening for that process to occur. The audit process will now go on, and ongoing monitoring will continue as this system moves into the years hence. If something dreadful does happen, if the Health Insurance Commission runs amuck, I am sure we can bring the legislation back into this place and deal with it; but there does not seem to be much sign of that happening at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by mentioning one thing that the minister said about the Doctors Reform Society which was most unfair. I have met with the Doctors Reform Society in a number of states&mdash;in three states in the last 12 months. I have addressed meetings and, to my memory, the number of society members at each of those meetings has been at least in double figure. Indeed at one meeting in Sydney the number of members present was several times in double figures. So the minister should go back and check on the number of people who work with and are members of that very valuable organisation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Chamarette, I guess it is fair to say that, if we follow your initial statements, then we should put a sunset clause on almost every piece of legislation that comes through this place&mdash;that we should check every piece of legislation and bring it back here. Sadly for your hypothesis there are in fact a number of other ways of monitoring legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We really had no problem with the fact that the sunset clause was needed to be put in. I think what you were suggesting, but perhaps did not say, was that this bill did give some slightly exceptional and stronger powers, in terms of the potential invasion of privacy, than most of the other bills we see here. So, on that basis, a sunset clause is probably quite reasonable and we were happy to go through this almost two-year period. You said, `There must be another.' That is fine; but, as Senator Lees has pointed out, there was not another way before and the ways that we had in place before did not work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me give the Senate a case which is de&hyphen;identified. A practice manager at a medical centre reported that she had seen a $6,000 cheque come into the medical centre from the director of an approved pathology authority&mdash;slightly suspicious circumstances. Later it was banked into the bank account of the centre. Interviews with other employees of the medical centre disclosed they had seen a number of cheques of the same sort of value coming into the medical centre from the same source. Fourteen briefs relating to possible offences against bribery legislation have been referred to the DPP in this matter and in the previous situation would not have gone beyond preliminary inquiry because the practice manager and the employees were not prepared to cooperate on a voluntary basis. It was only this legislation which got that message through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was an investigation into suspected public fraud which was facilitated by means <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of false bank accounts. The investigation came to an end because the bank refused to make banking records available, but the necessary information was obtained by using these powers. One of the offenders pleaded guilty and has been gaoled for 2&half; years. The other offender, I gather, comes up for trial in a couple of months time. What other way would there have been? This legislation has worked in those sorts of cases. I can give the Senate example after example, but the fact is I do not know of a better way. We were concerned about the possible misuse of the powers, but the facts are that there has been no suggestion of misuse and that the laws have worked very well indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Chamarette talked about the amount of money that might be saved. As Senator Lees pointed out, it is not the direct money we save, which may well be thousands of dollars or perhaps even hundreds of thousands of dollars, but the message we give to the other crooks and shonks, to use that expression again, in an area where strong powers can be used to find out what they are doing and prosecute them. So the savings are not in direct recompense for what we have extracted from the ones we find out about, but they come from the message we give to the people who would otherwise fiddle the system. That is obviously a very difficult figure to determine and one which, as Senator Lees quite rightly points out, will increase as time goes by so long as we continue to give the same sorts of messages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Chamarette talked about Senate evaluation rather than a National Audit Office evaluation. I am not as conceited as to think that I or any individual member of this Senate is better, or the Senate as a whole may be better, at investigating this sort of issue than the National Audit Office. I believe they have done a very good job in their investigation. I think they have been fairly thorough and fairly balanced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are also other ways in which we can continue to evaluate whether this legislation is working. I do not have to tell Senator Chamarette about annual reports and estimates committees&mdash;she is fairly familiar with those processes and has used them to great benefit <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1150"> over the last few years&mdash;and indeed ongoing audits will occur. So there is no question that a good evaluation of the process has been done and that a continuing evaluation will be done. If Senator Chamarette is unhappy about parts of it, those issues can be raised when the next estimates come around&mdash;perhaps not by her, as she probably will not be here, but by someone else&mdash;and subjected to scrutiny. Thank goodness we have those systems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In regard to listening to crooks and shonks, I do not often listen to them. I am not saying they have a voice that should not be heard, but I must say that I do not go out of my way to take advice as to how to help them to become even more crooked and shonky. I should point out that the AMA and the Medical Protection Society do have those people in their ranks. Of course, it is only a very small minority. In regard to the people who have been investigated under these powers, I am aware of no complaints from the AMA or the MPS, on behalf of the people they represent, about misuse of the power. Senator Chamarette may argue we have not spoken directly to those people, but their representative bodies&mdash;or at least two of them&mdash;have been aware of the situation and have apparently had no particular problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not in any way to suggest that we should inflict a lesser standard, because not only do those people have those mechanisms of the AMA and similar bodies but they have a number of other mechanisms available to them if those powers are misused. Directly coming to us in the Senate is not the only way of raising issues of concern about, for example, breaches of privacy, should they occur. Their voices can be heard. There is no question about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just to touch upon that last issue about the Doctors Reform Society: as I remember from the last time I looked at the figures, there are something like 18,000 GPs, let alone specialists, in Australia. I do not quite know the exact membership of the Doctors Reform Society. They have always declined to tell anybody. That they have refused to deny that they number not more than double figures in New South Wales I presume means that, if they number more than double figures, they <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> number much more than double figures. If we are looking at total GP, let alone specialist, numbers of 18,000, we are not exactly looking at mainstream representation of the views of the whole profession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not for one moment suggesting that the AMA is representative of everybody in the profession. As somebody who is happy to say he has never belonged to the AMA&mdash;and certainly at this stage of my career I do not plan to join the AMA&mdash;I am not suggesting the AMA is the be&hyphen;all and end&hyphen;all. But it is a much more representative body and therefore an appropriate one to consult on issues such as this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I really do not think Senator Chamarette made out a case for putting another year's sunset clause into this legislation. We have seen that it works; we have seen that it is fair. There are other mechanisms for evaluating issues if they come up. We should use those, and we should let the bill stand as initially presented.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not speak long on the Crimes Amendment (Controlled Operations) Bill 1996. I want to make two points in respect of it. One will be of interest to and pleasantly approved of by the government. The other raises a problem we have with deliberations over this legislation. The bill was introduced by the previous Labor government quite some time ago. It was one of those bills that did not quite make it to the deliberations in this place <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1151"> before the election. The bill, however, was sent off to the legislation committee of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, was inquired into and was assessed by that Senate committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate committee, in a sense, worked through the legislation fairly strenuously and came up with some amendments, some concerns, about the operation of the Crimes Amendment (Controlled Operations) Bill 1996. Those concerns essentially went to the issue of whether there were enough mechanisms in place to ensure that any potential avenue for abuse would be closely scrutinised. We are talking here of a bill that allows for the law enforcement agencies to run so-called controlled operations used for investigating unlawful activity. In a sense we are talking about situations where the Federal Police&mdash;and I think the NCA&mdash;may have some involvement in the operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government introduced the legislation in response to the High Court decision in Ridgeway. As a consequence, the bill has come to be known as `the Ridgeway bill'. We have no problem with the initial legislation that was introduced by the then justice minister, Mr Duncan Kerr, before the election. Looking at the government's raft of recommendations, we can say that we support most of them. We are talking about three sets of amendments that the government has put up. One is an amendment to ensure that controlled operations are only used for the purpose of investigating major unlawful activity, the emphasis being on the word `major'. We see that as a welcome initiative but we do not see how the intention, the desire, of the government has been expressed in the legislation. So obviously in the committee stage we will make some inquiries about how the legislation has been limited to major unlawful activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second raft of government amendments emanates from the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, and they are essentially accountability mechanisms as recommended by that committee. We do not have any problem with those amendments. The 1996 bill also provides protection for officers engaged in controlled operations from <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the possibility of committing offences involving the importation, exportation or possession of narcotics contrary to the Crimes (Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) Act of 1990, and we do not have any problems with respect to recommendation 3 either.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are concerned that one provision which provided for instant communication under section 15Q(3) of the 1995 bill has been deleted. That subsection provided that the applicant must notify the Comptroller-General&mdash;and we would argue that that should now be the Chief Executive Officer&mdash;of Customs either orally in person or by telephone or by any other electronic means of the operation. We would argue that this provision should not be deleted and we would be voting against the deletion of this provision in the committee stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So far, so good. I do not think the government would have any particular problems with the approach we are taking so far. There will, however, be amendments moved by the Australian Democrats which go to a further mechanism for scrutiny of the process that this legislation provides for, the controlled operations. Those amendments will provide that the process should be supervised by the courts and not by the police. In a sense, authority needs to be given by a judicial officer. This person, of course, will be independent of the AFP and the NCA and will have, we anticipate, discretion to knock back an application if the judicial officer felt there was just cause for doing so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My understanding is that the amendments to be moved by the Australian Democrats will call very closely on the precedent established under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act, which once again was legislation introduced and passed during the life of the previous government. There has been some discussion about whether that legislation is appropriate, whether it could be used here or not or whether it may, in fact, jeopardise the processes under this section. We are concerned that there is an external mechanism in place to ensure that not only do the law enforcement agencies know that if they mess up they will be accountable but also such a procedure, we feel, is likely to encourage the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1152"> AFP and the NCA to apply their minds more deeply to consider other means of gathering evidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We note that this is a course of action which was recommended to the parliament, to the government, on the 1995 bill&mdash;in fact on 22 August 1995&mdash;by the then, I think, shadow Attorney-General, though he may have been representing the shadow Attorney&hyphen;General in the House of Representatives. Daryl Williams called on the government to amend the bill so as to require applications to control operations to be made to a senior judicial officer. He also argued, as I would be arguing now, that the application process should be similar to that which applies under the interception act. So that would be our direction at this time. I do not know if Senator Spindler has his amendments ready but they would be amendments that we would need to look at to assess. But, as I say, in principle we agree with them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only complication has arisen in the last hour or so. I am now told that advice from the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department calls into question the legal capacity to provide for this external mechanism. It is very late advice and, obviously, it has an impact on the Senate's consideration on this particular matter. I am not inclined to make an instant judgment based on that last minute advice. At the appropriate time, I seek that the government adjourns consideration of Senator Spindler's amendments to consider further that legal advice provided to the Attorney&hyphen;General.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think it is an important issue and we are not prepared to let it slide on the basis of an amorphous bit of advice from the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department as to the capacity of judicial officers to carry out this function. We note that this function is one that has been carried out under the telephone interception act. We also note that there have been some arguments put forward that this particular situation is not identical to the situation that prevails under the interception act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> However, in the High Court in Grollo, there was some obiter about the capacity of judges when, on a six to one basis, the High Court upheld the power of judicial officers to issue intercept warrants. We say that legal prece dence provides sufficient foundation to allow us to consider the amendments put forward by Senator Spindler. It is not our intention to delay. I have probably said enough on this particular issue. I hope we do not complete second reading speeches tonight because we would then be given time to consider the government's advice overnight. But, Senator Vanstone, we would want to be satisfied about that advice before we are prepared to take a position in opposition to Senator Spindler's amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is one of those situations where the coalition put up something before the election. We have been persuaded by the then shadow attorney's arguments and we are inclined to support the sorts of propositions that he was putting forward then. In the transition to the government, he is now being persuaded by the arguments that persuaded the previous government, and maybe he is no longer as keen to do what he previously proposed before the election. I think a bit of time needs to be taken to see whether we can reach a consensual arrangement here. We think the legislation is important. We do not want to defer it, but we do want to clarify that particular point.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Other">Senator SPINDLER  (Victoria) (6.03 p.m.)&mdash;The Senate is considering the Crimes Amendment (Controlled Operations) Bill 1996. It might be useful to put on record the long title ofthe bill, which describes it very well. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Bill for an Act to amend the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Crimes Act </EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">1914 </EMPHASIS> to exempt from criminal liability certain law enforcement officers who engage in unlawful conduct to obtain evidence of offences relating to narcotics goods, and for related purposes.</PARA>
<PARA>This particular formulation gave the committee, the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, the legislative committee, a great deal of concern because the long heading really poses that conflict: that there is unlawful conduct in which certain law enforcement officers engage, and yet the bill seeks to arrange to make that unlawful conduct legal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Against that prospect, which filled most members of the committee with a great deal of concern, the argument was put forward by <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1153"> law enforcement officers that we are dealing with an area of law enforcement which is particularly difficult&mdash;narcotics trafficking. It is difficult because very large amounts of money are involved and the possibility of corruption is always there. It is also difficult because the people running narcotics operations can avail themselves of the means to retain the best lawyers to make their operations, even before the case gets to court, as foolproof as possible, and they are notoriously hard to catch. Of course, we are all aware of the fact that narcotics drugs are causing a great deal of damage in our community, at all age levels, but particularly amongst our young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It raises the question of whether the route that we have followed&mdash;namely, to prohibit drugs and thereby create a black market and the opportunity for untold profits to be gained from trafficking&mdash;is the right one to deal with that social damage. I am pleased to say that now there are a number of attempts in the ACT and in Victoria to grapple with that problem and to look at alternatives. But we have not reached that stage yet; we are still in the area of trying to minimise the damage by catching the main offenders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this effort, the bill is a response to the High Court decision of Ridgeway v. The Queen, where the High Court held that the police did not have the power to allow the importation of heroin in a so-called controlled operation. This bill is designed to provide the police with the power to participate in narcotics trafficking for investigative purposes and, in particular, for the purpose of bringing to justice the main offenders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The basic question arises of whether the police should be involved in drug trafficking, and the bill deals with a number of very important principles. In a free society, the people must never have the power to bait otherwise law&hyphen;abiding citizens into engaging in criminal activity. As Mr Justice McHugh said in the Ridgeway decision:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Testing the integrity of citizens can quickly become a tool of political oppression and an instrument for creating a police state mentality.</PARA>
<PARA>However, the bill as it now stands does not do that. Rather, it simply provides for an <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> extension of the police power to monitor, to react and then to participate for the purpose of investigating the targeted criminal activity, an activity which is being planned by the police for the purpose of bringing the perpetrators to justice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Section 15 specifically states that no authority to engage in a controlled operation will be given if `the conduct of the officer involves intentionally inducing the person targeted by the operation to commit an offence'. That addresses the question of entrapment which was of great concern to me personally during the committee deliberations and, I believe, to the committee as a whole. This, I believe, has now been addressed satisfactorily in this bill that is before the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other area that was of great concern was the accountability question and the mechanism that is provided in the bill. These provisions, as they now stand, are quite strong. For example, a certificate authorising a controlled operation must be in writing and must include a description of the operation. Secondly, as soon as a controlled operation has either been authorised or denied, the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police must inform the appropriate minister of the decision and the reasons for it. And, thirdly, within three months of a certificate authorising a controlled operation lapsing, a written report must be presented to the appropriate minister setting out: (a) whether or not the operation was carried out; (b) the nature and quantity of the narcotics goods involved in the operation; (c) the route through which the narcotics passed; (d) the identity of any person who has or had possession of the narcotics; and (e) whether or not the narcotics have been destroyed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, it is worth mentioning that the appropriate minister must present an annual account to the Commonwealth parliament setting out: firstly, the date on which each application for a controlled operation was made; secondly, the decisions taken about each application; thirdly, the reasons for decisions; and, finally, the operational information that I mentioned just before.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1154">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the Democrats believe that, as the bill now stands, the concerns about entrapment and accountability have been adequately met. In all of this, there is of course the concern that we must protect the persons who are undercover agents in these operations and must not jeopardise them. That, in some ways, has given us concern in the area of how you actually authorise, and who does the authorising, of such an operation. I am fully conscious of the fact, in putting forward an amendment that it should be a judicial officer that should decide that, similar to the intercept provisions, quite apart from the constitutional question, that it could open up a source of danger. Because in some way the information must be detailed enough to the judicial officer to enable that person to make an informed decision on the balance of probabilities based on information supplied. Nevertheless, the Democrats believe that the Senate should seriously consider going down this route and require a judicial officer to approve such controlled operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Presently, authority for a controlled operation can be given by the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, a deputy commissioner, an assistant commissioner or a member of the National Crime Authority. But we are concerned that all of these people, essentially, are involved on the operational side of law enforcement and perhaps do not at all times have the distance from the day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day pressures to make a decision on whether in any particular case an unlawful operation should be sanctioned. So we suggest that the present provisions are not sufficient.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We support, indeed, the comments made by the Attorney&hyphen;General, Mr Daryl Williams, when debating an earlier draft of the bill when he said that a controlled operation should require the approval of a judicial officer. We wonder why that has changed, why there is a different view. I have not had an opportunity to study in detail the opinion provided by the chief general counsel of the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department. But I note and I should quote the first paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have been asked to provide advice on whether if the controlled operations bill were amended to require a judge to issue a certificate authorising an operation this would give rise to constitutional  <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">difficulties. In my opinion, the use of judges in the way suggested would at least raise questions as to whether such a function was compatible with the discharge of judicial functions, and this could be a ground on which to challenge the validity of the provisions.</PARA>
<PARA>To me, the phrase `would at least raise questions' is not one that puts forward a view held with great conviction. But, as I have said, I have not had an opportunity, as has Senator Bolkus, who spoke before me, to assess the opinion in great detail, and I would support his suggestion that we provide some time after second reading stage to address this very question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, we believe that in a properly administered society there should be a check between one arm of the state and another, particularly where there is potential for a significant abuse of power. A controlled operation provides the potential for just such an abuse of power. In his report into police corruption in Queensland, Commissioner Fitzgerald stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . drugs have caused more incursions into the civil liberties of ordinary people, more corruption and more interference than almost anything else.</PARA>
<PARA>We believe that, by ensuring there is independent scrutiny of applications for controlled operations, there will be less opportunity for corrupt activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, the Australian Democrats welcome the Crimes Amendment (Controlled Operations) Bill 1996 as a potentially valuable addition to the investigative tools that are at the disposal of the police. We believe that the accountability measures in the bill are strong and, with the benefit of the amendments which I will be moving, they will be stronger still.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Crimes Amendment (Controlled Operations) Bill 1996 deals with that classic question of how society is to control those activities within it which it finds repugnant&mdash;and, clearly, society finds repugnant the importation of large quantities of drugs and their sale to those who are, in effect, victims. As Senator Spindler has said, it is the sale of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1155"> these drugs to those victims that causes all sorts of terrible trouble in the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue is the classic issue: does the end justify the means? If the means are of such an abhorrent nature, then those means can never justify the end, no matter what. Any society we look at, if it is to be a good and proper society, has to be a society that is ruled by law&mdash;that is, subject to the rule of law. For example, it would not be open to this parliament, with any sense of justice, in any event, to make lawful murder, manslaughter, rape, grievous bodily harm or, indeed, any sort of bodily harm for the purposes of obtaining evidence to obtain a conviction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is being looked at here is a controlled operation in the sense that a transaction involving drugs would be facilitated, to some extent at least, to ensure that evidence is obtained&mdash;that is, evidence against people who are making use of those drugs for fearful and criminal purposes&mdash;which can be led in a court and which may form the basis of a conviction, if a jury decides to accept it. As I understand the argument, people have accepted that there ought to be some process by which evidence can be obtained against people who carry out the type of crime we have been talking about&mdash;that is, the crime of importing and selling drugs. The concern is about the check that is placed upon those who are going to carry out this particular procedure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been some doubt, I think it would be fair to say, cast upon the efficacy of having the commissioner, one of three deputy commissioners and one of six assistant commissioners available to give permission for this procedure, and for one of the members of the National Crime Authority to give permission. So, in fact, there is Mr Palmer himself, the Commissioner, his three deputy commissioners and six assistant commissioners, and three members of the National Crime Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Spindler has properly mentioned the Fitzgerald inquiry in Queensland. May I say that it has never been suggested, as far as I know, and I keep an ear out for these things, that any of the people whom I have described&mdash;that is, the Commissioner of the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australian Federal Police, the three deputy commissioners, the six assistant commissioners and the three members of the National Crime Authority&mdash;are or have been in any way tainted by corruption, unethical or untoward conduct. The reputations they all have had and still do have are outstanding ones. In my view, that is a very big point to take into account when looking at the way this operates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been suggested that the classic procedure of getting a warrant from a judge is the proper way of going about this exercise. I have not had a chance to look fully at what Senator Spindler has put forward. I always like to look carefully at whatever documents Senator Spindler puts forward, because I know they will be very substantial and considerable documents, but I am not sure that this is a procedure that ought go before a judge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The difficulty I find with warrants is that judges who give warrants necessarily give them on the basis of affidavit material, sworn material, and then that is really the end of it. I am trying to think of some instances&mdash;perhaps the minister may be able to help me&mdash;where people have gone back and looked at the warrant and the warrant has been audited. I think there are some cases, but not all that many. I think the judges issue the warrants and then a procedure is followed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where the certificate is issued by one of those people that I have mentioned&mdash;the commissioner, a deputy commissioner, an assistant commissioner or a member of the National Crime Authority&mdash;there is an audit under clause 15M of the bill. As I understand it&mdash;and I am subject to being corrected here&mdash;the authorising officer is subject to cross-examination in court about the basis upon which he or she gave a certificate. So the enforcement officer and the authorising officer are able to be examined in court about the basis upon which the certificate was obtained and are able to be cross-examined as to the actions taken in accordance with that certificate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also the control of having to report to the Attorney-General. I know of no Attorney-General who has taken their task in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1156"> any way other than very seriously. I am sure that is a matter to be taken into account here. If the judge was to take over the place of a commissioner, a deputy commissioner, an assistant commissioner or a member of the National Crime Authority, the question then arises as to whether or not he or she should be subject to cross-examination. In my view, that would be a terrible path for us to take. Judges should not, in my view, be taken to court to be examined, whether by cross-examination or by evidence-in-chief, as to what they did in the giving of a warrant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I looked very quickly at the amendments put forward by Senator Spindler. At first sight, they do have some attraction, but as you look at them there are some problems. The amendment to 15GA(1) states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD" FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD" FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Judge</EMPHASIS>  means a person who is a Judge of a court created by the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA>In that case, I would have thought you could go only to the Federal Court. So that is limited to a judge of the Federal Court. It goes on under 15GA(2):</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Judge may by writing consent to be nominated by the Minister under subsection (3).</PARA>
<PARA>I would have thought&mdash;and I do not purport to know&mdash;judges would have a lot of problems applying for this sort of job if it went any further than simply issuing a warrant. If it goes no further than issuing a warrant, it seems to me that the measures in the main bill are going to be more effective than the giving of a warrant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my view, this would be a good subject for inquiry by the Legal and Constitutional Committee, or, indeed, by some other committee, as to the effectiveness of the warrant system&mdash;the system whereby a law enforcement officer goes to a judge to have a warrant issued to carry out an intercept, an arrest or a search of property or of a person. Until that is done, it seems to me&mdash;and I would very much like to hear argument about this&mdash;that the present situation that is set out in this bill might be the best. Certainly, it gives counsel on both sides of the record a better opportunity of testing how the certificate was obtained and how the directions in the certificate were carried out than is the situation where a warrant is obtained. I would be interested to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> hear what is said in the committee stage of this bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not my intention to take up a great deal of the Senate's time in this debate, but I want to put on the record the grave concern of the Greens (WA) at the notion that the Senate is contemplating legislating for illegal activities in the form of the Crimes Amendment (Controlled Operations) Bill 1995.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill arises from the former government's reaction&mdash;or, some would say, overreaction&mdash;to the High Court ruling in the Ridgeway case. The court ruled that when police act illegally the evidence in any subsequent proceeding against an individual will be tainted to the point where it is unusable. To our way of thinking, it is a fundamental point of natural justice that a person should not be set up by the police for an offence. Indeed, even the long title of the bill is offensive: `A Bill for an Act to amend the Crimes Act 1914 to exempt from criminal liability certain law enforcement officers who engage in unlawful conduct to obtain evidence' et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The two main concerns we have are that police should not be above the law&mdash;the law that they are there to enforce&mdash;and they should not be able to engage in criminal activities in the entrapment of people who may also be engaged in criminal activities. The second concern relates to the broader aspects of the culture that is involved in the drug dealing and trafficking scene.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) spoke about the tragedy at Port Arthur and the need to address more broadly the culture of violence in our community I believe that he was referring to the more subtle aspects of our society. One aspect is the culture in drug dealing and trafficking that acknowledges that police engage in activities of drug dealing and trafficking in order to elicit information. As a consequence, the police are frequently tempted into behaviour that leads to corruption. In fact, there have been anecdotal reports of this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The corruption of law enforcement officials is currently in the spotlight because of the work of the Wood royal commission, and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1157"> there have been longstanding concerns about the drug trade and its potential to corrupt those officials. A 1989 report by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority explicates some of the reasons why corruption occurs. Enormous profits are available and police corruption can arise because officers are human and the temptation to take money and to be involved becomes very great.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are doing is introducing into the culture where the problem already exists an additional power, a power that allows law enforcement officers to hide behind it. As I was pointing out to someone in a briefing earlier today, there is no doubt that the powers that are being considered under this act are limited; however, the very fact that they are being given and exist allows other police officers to use the justification that they thought they were covered by these powers even when they were not. So I have very serious concerns about the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that on 6 August 1995 the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> reported, and I quote from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bills Digest</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>

<PARA>So what we have is the possibility for the actual illegal behaviour of drug trafficking and dealing being enhanced by the involvement of police who are being protected under the components of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since this bill was first mooted by the former government, like many other senators no doubt, I have been strenuously lobbied about its content and implications. In particular, a group calling itself the Ridgeway Coalition was formed to make a concerted effort to head off these changes to the Crimes Act. It is the view of the Ridgeway Coalition <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that the legislation is unnecessary as the existing law governing undercover police, as articulated in Ridgeway, is workable and satisfactory. This is not the view of disgruntled people who have been subject to police sting operations but the considered response from a group of lawyers and their various associations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to take this opportunity to put some of the views expressed to me on the record, as I believe they provide a suitable caution for the Senate. The Lawyers Reform Association wrote, saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In our opinion, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ridgeway</EMPHASIS>  is a carefully considered and measured decision which balances the public interest in bringing offenders to justice and the necessity of the police resorting to unorthodox methods to do so, against the undesirability of police commissioning criminal activities themselves.</PARA>
<PARA>The association also pointed out that an enormous amount of evidence of police corruption, particularly in the area of drug law enforcement, has been provided to the Wood royal commission in New South Wales. It is well worth remembering that the operations which this bill seeks to authorise could well open further avenues for such corruption.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, the South Australian Bar Association made a submission to the Senate legal and constitutional committee. That submission pointed to a number of cases where the notion that police should be able to act illegally in order to achieve arrests and prosecutions was roundly condemned by the courts. The association states its position thus:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Association views with scepticism any legislative attempt which has as its objective the sanctioning of criminal conduct on the part of certain sections of the community. It is, in our view, undesirable that Parliament should effectively condone criminal behaviour in any way, shape or form.</PARA>
<PARA>The association further argues that, rather than provide for police to act illegally but without attracting criminal sanctions, the bill should declare certain acts not to be offences if done by police officers under certain circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The matter of the bill's retrospective operation on some existing cases is also a matter of grave concern. Therefore, the Greens (WA) will oppose the bill.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1158">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is a party to the UN Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances which provides for controlled operations of the kind envisaged by this legislation. This did raise a matter of concern for us as we do not lightly turn our backs on international obligations. However, the convention as we understand it allows for controlled operations where they are compatible with the law of the country concerned. What we are doing at the moment is making our laws compatible and, therefore, complying with the obligations of international treaties. I am sure that Senator Abetz will be relieved to hear that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We understand that the bill will be passed by the Senate in spite of our opposition to it. Therefore, we are determined to see that the best possible legislation is put in place which balances the need to protect the rights of individuals in the community with the need to combat large scale drug crime. To that end, we will involve ourselves in the debate on the amendments. We presently support all those amendments that are being put forward by the ALP and the Democrats.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate the fact that I have been given the opportunity to make a few comments in relation to the Crimes Amendment (Controlled Operations) Bill. This bill was before the Senate before the election and was put to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. We considered it in some detail. Those who are interested in the legislation, some of the public policy grounds behind it and some of the balancing acts that were required to be undertaken to achieve this bill, would do very well to read this report which I note is a unanimous report from the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an excellent example of how the Senate and its committee system work, but which hardly gets the sort of media coverage that I believe our committee system deserves. For people who want to know what a controlled operation is and why we need to have such things, the policy standpoint of the bill is that involvement in controlled operations is necessary as an investigatory device in the detection and prosecution of narcotic offences.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The main issue that we as a committee looked at was whether the threat posed by illegal trafficking in drugs such as heroin warrants the response contained in this bill. Therefore, it is a balancing act. It is trite but appropriate to say that testing the integrity of citizens can quickly become a tool of political oppression and an instrument for creating a police state mentality. What I just said are the words of Justice McHugh in his decision in the Ridgeway case. This legislation is a legislative response to the Ridgeway decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of matters of a public policy nature. That is something that we as a committee have grappled with. It should be pointed out that there is nothing exceptional in exempting police officers from certain aspects of the criminal law, as this bill does. Basically, certain police officers will be allowed to undertake activities which would otherwise be unlawful, to assist them in catching and apprehending people who are trading in a commodity which is well known to cause considerable social dislocation and, indeed, death. Most of us would agree that those who peddle drugs are merchants of death. Sometimes we need some very sophisticated methods to deal with and trap those sorts of people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is my submission to the Senate and to the Greens that it is a legitimate role of the parliament to make the demarcation of permissible and non&hyphen;permissible behaviour for particular persons within the community, in this case, the police. In the committee's view there is no fundamental difference between the bill and the long tradition in all common law jurisdictions of defining, by statute and, where appropriate, extending, the powers of the police. It would be agreed, I think, by everybody that the involvement of police in criminal conduct is not a desirable occurrence but the committee agreed that the perceptions that such involvement may create&mdash;that is, there are double standards&mdash;are destructive of public confidence in the administration of justice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the alternative in the committee's view is more unattractive, being the diminution of the success of law enforcement activity against drug crime and, ultimately, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1159"> more illegal drugs being available within the Australian community.They were some of the balancing acts we as a committee undertook when looking at some of the competing arguments that had been put to the committee for and against the proposals that this bill deals with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate committee made a number of recommendations. I am not sure whether the previous government officially responded to those recommendations but it is pleasing to see that the new Attorney&hyphen;General, Daryl Williams QC, has incorporated into this new bill all the recommendations of the Senate committee. That I think is testament to the work of the committee. A very important aspect was that the committee recommended that a provision be inserted in the bill clarifying that the bill does not permit entrapment. That is important. There were some other matters which the committee dealt with. I will just read one of the other recommendations, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A provision should be inserted into the bill clarifying that it does not in any way remove from a court its inherent and constitutional power and duty to ensure that justice is done in the conduct of the matter before it, including the power to terminate or stay proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA>A suggestion has been put to us that there ought to be some capacity for judicial consideration or judicial authorisation of some of these programs. I think this is the first time ever, and chances are last time ever, that I am going to refer honourable senators to a speech of the former Minister for Justice, the Hon. Duncan Kerr. On 22 August 1995 in addressing this legislation he made some pertinent points about judicial authorisation within the context of controlled operations. On that occasion Mr Kerr stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the case of a controlled operation, there is no civil liberty to import narcotics free of police involvement.</PARA>
<PARA>He made that comment to distinguish that aspect from, let us say, having a search warrant to search your house. I think we would all agree there is a civil liberty expected by the community that you can enjoy the privacy of your house without a police officer visiting it at all hours of the night, unless <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> there is some degree of authorisation for a warrant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decision to authorise an operation rests on an assessment of the likely effectiveness and security of the operation and a judgment about whether or not that person would be likely to have pursued that course irrespective of the operation. That is important: whether they would be likely to have pursued that course irrespective of the operation. In my submission that is different to deliberately trying to set up a trap for somebody who might not necessarily have been intending to engage in a particular type of behaviour. Mr Kerr went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">These are essentially operational questions and require judgments addressing the whole issue of what resources are available to law enforcement and the capacity of that operation to protect the community as a whole from any diversion. All those issues are ones which are simply not appropriate to pass from the person who has the correct responsibility of making a judgment to a court official.</PARA>
<PARA>He further stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is hardly appropriate to place such law enforcement possibilities into the hands of courts, which are essentially charged with an adjudicative function rather than a function of operating as part of the executive.</PARA>
<PARA>In summarising his speech Mr Kerr said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">For that reason and the issue of the separation of powers, there are real constitutional reasons why operations should not be authorised by judges and magistrates. Courts have made it clear that it is contrary to the separation of powers and hence constitutionally invalid for judges and magistrates to perform administrative functions.</PARA>
<PARA>I would encourage those thinking of amendments along certain lines to read the House of Representatives <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  of Tuesday, 22 August 1995, especially pages 76 and 77, where Mr Kerr sets out the reasons why judicial involvement in controlled operations would not be desirable and in fact could lead to very real constitutional difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think every member of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee when considering this legislation was of the view that in the ideal world there should not be any controlled operations. That would be the ideal world. But, of course, in the ideal world there would not be any crimes of drug <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1160"> smuggling and drug peddling. Unfortunately, we do not live in an ideal world, and therefore it is a question of balancing competing principles. On balance, I think the committee brought down a unanimous report. I thought there may have been a dissenting judgment by Senator Spindler, but he is shaking his head. I did not want to do him an injustice. My recollection was that it was a unanimous report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe the Senate committee maturely considered all the issues extensively and canvassed the competing principles which I have already mentioned. Those of us on the committee who have a legal background&mdash;that includes me, Senator Ellison, and Senator Cooney, though I am not sure whether Senator Cooney ever appeared in the criminal jurisdiction&mdash;as defence counsel would not necessarily like this sort of legislation. But when you see the sort of havoc that can be caused within the community by these merchants of death, these peddlers of narcotics, you have to ask, `What is the worst evil?' Unfortunately, that is the basis on which I came down on the side of supporting the necessity of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It gave me no joy, and I am sure none of the other committee members, to have to do that, but it is a difficult area. When you talk to parents and families that have lost loved ones because of the black market narcotics industry, you have to agree that there should be a balance. I accept the criticisms that have been made about the police in the past and undoubtedly will continue to do so in the future. Those of us who have been watching with ever increasing horror the day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day revelations of the Wood royal commission in New South Wales would be very concerned. I was talking to a constituent in my office on Friday about this very matter. She told me that certain complaints had been made to the police about a drug matter in New South Wales of which she was aware. She then put in a throwaway line, `But, of course, chances are it never got anywhere.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a deep distrust at the moment of the police, especially in some areas of Australia. In general terms, I think, it is a well-founded distrust. That is why the mechanisms <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> within the legislation&mdash;certificates being needed to be signed, the minister being made aware and the tabling within the parliament of the previous 12 months activities&mdash;will provide that sort of balance I was talking about earlier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In all these things it has always been a question of balance. I think in the past the police have been able to get away with far too much. That, of course, is no revelation to anybody in this chamber, given the revelations of the Wood royal commission in New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As best as both parties could in the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee we tried to achieve a balance which would protect the community against excessive police power and prevent narcotics dealers and others from being able to get away without any real likelihood of their being apprehended. It was on undertaking that balancing act that we came to the resolution to support the legislation with a few amendments, all of which have been picked up by the Attorney-General. It is on that basis that I recommend this bill to the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not left anybody out. That is a good thing. I would like to run through a couple of the changes in the Crimes Amendment (Controlled Operations) Bill 1996 as opposed to the previous bill in the last parliament. There are some changes implementing the Senate committee recommendations. I only want to touch briefly on those so people are aware of what they are.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first change preserves judicial discretions to exclude evidence or to stay proceedings except to the extent that these discretions are expressly restricted by the bill. That is to be found in proposed subsection 15G(2). The second group of amendments provides that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1161"> certificates issued under the bill do not authorise entrapment. Conduct constituting entrapment will not be protected by a certificate issued under proposed section 15M of the bill. Senators interested in that matter might like to look to proposed subsections 15I(2) and 15I(5). I will return to the question of entrapment after I have dealt with the third change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final group of amendments requires the making of reports to the minister and to parliament detailing the route through which narcotic goods have passed during the course of an operation, the persons or agencies who had control of the goods during and after the operation, and the current status and whereabouts of narcotic goods. That is to be found in proposed section 15S.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are the three changes reflecting the Senate committee recommendations. It is worth making the point that, as I understand it, the previous government was somewhat disinclined to accept those recommendations. I simply wish to underline that this government through Mr Williams, the Attorney-General, has decided that they have merit and they are being implemented. Having served on that committee, it pleases me to, only slightly, labour that point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to the point about entrapment, the bill does expressly prevent the authorisation of operations that would involve entrapment. I did make a note of Senator Chamarette's words, but I seem to have mislaid it. It was to the effect that we do not want to have the police setting people up, which is in effect what entrapment would be. To authorise an operation, an authorising officer must be satisfied that the criminal conduct being investigated would have taken place without police involvement&mdash;that is, it would have gone ahead in any event. Thus an operation that was to involve police supplying narcotics to a person who was not the intended recipient of the narcotics could not be authorised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government amendments to the bill build in an extra prohibition on entrapment. A certificate issued under section 15M will not protect an officer from liability for conduct involving intentional inducement of a person to commit an offence of a kind that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the person would not otherwise have had intent to commit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, it has been suggested in some quarters that an operation should only be allowed where the specific importation planned by the suspect would have taken place without police involvement. Such an approach would render the ability to conduct controlled operations almost meaningless. All controlled operations involve a situation in which police are aware of a proposed importation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is axiomatic, therefore, that a controlled operation involves an importation that could have been prevented by law enforcement officials. They could not possibly decide to be part of something and monitor what was happening if they did not know about it. It follows that, if they knew about it, they may have had the capacity to do something to stop it happening. That is not entrapment. Entrapment is where a person who would otherwise have obeyed the law is induced to commit an offence. That is what proposed section 15M and the amended section 15I of the bill prohibit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> This bill does nothing to interfere with the existing law regarding entrapment. While Ridgeway reaffirmed that there is no substantive defence of entrapment in Australia, the judges also indicated that in a case of serious entrapment a court could permanently stay proceedings. I think it was worth raising that point in response to the debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A point has also been raised as to when these matters should come into effect&mdash;that is, when a controlled operation should be used. To paraphrase the question, one could say, `Shouldn't a controlled operation be a last resort only, where evidence cannot be obtained in any other way?' In that respect&mdash;and this goes to the point that Senator Chamarette raised&mdash;where police intercept a narcotics consignment, a controlled operation will generally be the only way in which it is possible to obtain evidence against the intended recipient. The bill does however require the authorising officer to be satisfied that the operation will make it much easier to obtain evidence leading to the prosecution of a Commonwealth narcotics offence. In other <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1162"> words, where other methods of obtaining evidence are reasonably available the legislation does not allow a controlled operation to be authorised. Ultimately, operational judgment has a key role to play. Controlled operations are difficult for police to organise, and I do not believe there is any real incentive for them to carry out these operations unnecessarily.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps one of the most concerning points that Senator Chamarette raised was the question of the bill inviting a further risk of security in relation to drugs. That question was asked frequently when this matter was before the Senate committee. Isn't this just inviting an opportunity for further corruption in the police force, as highlighted by the Wood royal commission? I think even the specific example that Senator Chamarette raised, or one very similar&mdash;Senator Spindler may be able to help me here&mdash;was actually raised during the hearings on that matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people who were able to attend the committee hearing are aware of that. It is worth pointing out that if we are to have any hope of bringing narcotics traffickers to justice, we have to give police the adequate powers. The way to prevent corruption is not to deny police these powers; it is to build in effective accountability mechanisms and safeguards against abuse of powers. Nobody who supports this bill could possibly be claimed to be supporting a system that would condone any police officer abusing the powers that they have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the report of the Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct, on page 172, Commissioner Fitzgerald concluded that the true choice may be between a society altered by legislative or executive action to the extent which is necessary to hamper the misuse of civic privileges by criminals or a society altered by those criminals and their activities and that it might be preferable to have a limited qualification of rights so that they can be enjoyed in the freer atmosphere of a fairer, more honest and honourable society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to note that openness and accountability are central to the framework established by this bill. The bill requires a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> detailed report to be made to the minister at the time of a decision whether to authorise an operation, and will now also require a detailed report to be made about what happened during and after the operation. In turn, this information will be reported to the parliament and will be subject therefore to public scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An officer who sought to deal in narcotics outside the course of duty would face the normal penalties for narcotics  trafficking. Federal law enforcement officers are already subject to a strict disciplinary regime. Australian Federal Police officers, who will play the leading role in most operations, are subject to disciplinary and criminal penalties for misconduct under both the AFP Act and the AFP disciplinary regulations. AFP officers are employed on contract and can be summarily dismissed in cases of misconduct. Authorising operations will be the responsibility of the dozen most senior officers in federal law enforcement. If operations are improperly authorised or if narcotics go astray, responsibility will be brought home to these officers at the very highest level of law enforcement. I think that covers the main points that I wanted to refer to, vis-a-vis what Senator Chamarette had to say.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make the point that I was of the impression a few minutes ago that the previous government had not actively indicated its support with respect to these recommendations. I understand they had decided to accept all of the recommendations made by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. However those government amendments had not been tabled in the Senate when the bill lapsed due to parliament having been dissolved. It is just worth putting that on the record, because I am informed that the government had made that decision, albeit that amendments had not been actually brought forward with respect to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to refer to a number of other changes that have been recommended by the Attorney-General, and there are three that I particularly want to refer to. The first is an extension of the definition of narcotics goods offence. This is found in subsection 3(1). It is an amendment that extends the definitions of narcotics <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1163"> goods offences and associated offences to include offences against the Crimes (Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) Act 1990. The second is in relation to the serious offence provision. That is to be found in subsection 15R(3). It is a requirement that issuing officers give consideration to, and report on, the seriousness of an offence before issuing a certificate authorising a controlled operation. The last change is the extension to state officers. That is found in subsection 15I(3). That provision extends the coverage of the bill to state officers assisting in the investigation of Commonwealth offences from liability for state narcotics offences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to move briefly to the issue of serious criminal activity, which I understand Senator Bolkus raised. He raised the issue of where the government gives effect to the proposal the mechanism of controlled operation should be available only for serious criminal activity. As I have just indicated, that is subsection 15R(3). It is perhaps worth mentioning that subsection 15R(3) of the bill provides that, as soon as practicable after a decision to authorise a controlled operation is made, the authorising officer must inform the minister of that decision and of the reasons for that decision, including:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">an indication of the extent to which the authorising officer, in making the decision, took into account the seriousness of the criminal activities of:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) the person targeted by the operation; or</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) any other person associating, or acting in concert, with that person. . . </PARA>
<PARA>That amendment to the bill is an additional safeguard to those proposed by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee. I understand that, because of the difficulty of defining `serious criminal activity' in a way that would cover all appropriate cases, and to avoid making this requirement a source of challenge to the validity of a certificate during the inevitable test of certificates that would occur during a major narcotics case, it is appropriate that this provision be located in the section of the bill dealing with matters that must be reported to the minister, which is of course after the certificate has been issued.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Chamarette raised the question: why not remove the immunity and instead say <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that the conduct of the police officer is not an offence? I want to refer to some notes that highlight how very limited the protection is. It is limited to particular officers. The officers who may be protected from criminal liability under this bill are officers of the Federal Police, National Crime Authority, Australian Customs Service, state and territory police forces and foreign law enforcement agencies. They are the officers that are affected and I suppose that seems fairly broad.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But which offences does it relate to? Exemption from criminal liability would extend to the following offences: firstly, importing or exporting narcotic goods contrary to section 233B of the Customs Act; secondly, state and territory offences, an element of which is the possession of narcotic goods; and, thirdly, being knowingly concerned in aiding, abetting, attempting, inciting or conspiring to commit one of those offences. For constitutional reasons the bill does not protect state and territory police officers from criminal liability for state and territory offences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the circumstances covered by the bill, the conduct of a law enforcement officer will not result in criminal liability if it is carried out in the course of duty, is for the purposes of an investigation into a suspected or anticipated Commonwealth narcotics offence, is while a certificate issued under the bill authorising the operation is in force, and, under the amendments to the bill, does not involve the officer inducing a person to commit an offence of a kind that the person would otherwise have lacked intent to commit. A foreign law enforcement officer is to be acting in the course of duty if, and only if, he or she is acting under the directions of an Australian law enforcement officer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am informed that your proposal would be simply ineffective. If your suggestion were adopted&mdash;that is, provided that the conduct by a police officer would not be an offence&mdash;the otherwise illegal importation could be rendered lawful, the police officer would be immune and, unfortunately, therefore so would the criminal conspirators. I think what that means is that the way in which it is envisaged one would design a clause to cater for that which you suggest would have other <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1164"> consequences that you would not apparently want.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last but not least I want to come to the most contentious matter&mdash;although I do not mean `contentious' in the sense of `heated' in any way whatsoever&mdash;and that is the issue of the authorisation of these certificates. There are some good arguments against judicial authorisation. The government thinks the proposal should be rejected for several reasons. Firstly, the decision of the High Court in Grollo and the AFP commissioner in the 1995 case subtitled, I understand, Grollo No. 2 indicates that a law which involves judges in the criminal investigation process could well be invalid. None of us would want to see that. We saw that with the bankruptcy legislation. We saw it with some of the human rights legislation, where parliament did not take enough time to ascertain the constitutionality of what it wanted to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wanted to try to cover this in the few remaining minutes, Senator Spindler. I know you raised this matter and I think you said that you understand the proposition that the government is putting is arguable. All I want to do, to highlight this for you tonight, is to say that, if it is arguable, then you are perhaps conceding that a bill passed in the form you are suggesting is arguably unconstitutional. I ask you to consider overnight whether that is an appropriate course of action for you to really want to proceed with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I accept that you may not be able to or want to bring yourself to say, `Yes, it would be unconstitutional.' But, even if the risk is there, the issue is whether you want to, in a sense, give it a run and put at risk what would later be put at risk if a bill were passed in the form that you suggest. I perhaps can do no better than refer senators opposite to a speech given in August 1995 by Mr Kerr, the then Minister for Justice. I think it was referred to by my colleague Senator Abetz. It very cogently puts the case that judicial authorisation would be inappropriate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The officer must be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that the person has in his or her possession, or will within the next 72 hours have in his or her possession, any evidentiary material.</PARA>
<PARA>It seems to me there is a very strong analogy between that and what I am suggesting. However, in considering both these points there may be some merit in not omitting at the moment the section which lists the authorising officers but simply adding `judicial officer' to require the authorising officers to seek the certificate from the judge or judicial officer. This would have the effect, first of all, that in subsequent proceedings you would be able to cross-examine the authorising officers and, secondly, of removing the judge considerably further from the operation of considerations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the moment my amendment suggests that the law enforcement officer in charge of the operation would approach the judge. I foreshadow an amendment that would leave the authorising officers in place but oblige them to approach the judge for a certificate.</PARA>

This report mentions `closure claims' and is complete with photograph and all. It relates to the Ravenswood Youth Centre. Mr Smith says that the youth centre is threatened with closure by a trade union endeavouring to represent workers in that industry. He says it is because of a log of claims that has been lodged with the centre. Mr Smith, who is a federal minister and has <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> been a member of parliament over some time even though he lost his seat in 1993&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FX5">Senator MURPHY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, and I am sure the people of Bass will reconsider that when it comes to the next federal election. Mr Smith says that somehow this log of claims will lead to the closure of the Ravenswood Youth Centre. He knows full well that that is simply not true. Any action by any other individual carrying out this sort of activity&mdash;that is, deliberately quoting in the paper something that is not correct&mdash;would be deemed to be dishonest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Smith would know&mdash;or at least if he does not know he should know, but I believe he does know and that is why this is misleading&mdash;a log of claims is served for the purpose of creating a dispute. A log of claims usually contains an ambit, and the purpose of the log of claims when it is lodged with an employer is to endeavour to rope employers into awards. Those matters are ultimately decided in the federal Industrial Relations Commission. The commission will determine which award is applicable to the employer and indeed the set of wages that will apply to the particular job at hand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this case, not only did Mr Smith not endeavour to check with the union but he did not endeavour to check with even the department. Had he done so, he would have found out that in the case of a community services award, which is more than likely the award that would be applicable to the youth centre, the rate for the person concerned in this job&mdash;and there is only one of them&mdash;is around the $20,000 to $25,000 mark.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know it is not&mdash;and Warwick Smith should know it is not&mdash;a question of whether or not a log of claims will force the closure of the Ravenswood Youth Centre. Rather, it is a question of whether or not Mr Smith's government will provide ongoing and recurrent funding for this centre. That is the fundamental question, and Mr Warwick Smith ought to be ashamed of himself for trying to hide behind this very dodgy claim to the media that somehow some log of claims lodged by a trade union will have some impact on the closure. It is another example <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1166"> of how this government, since it has been in office, has not adhered one iota to the election promises it made, championed by Mr Smith.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To go through the list of Mr Smith's claims again, he said during the election campaign that, should the coalition be elected to government, they would in terms of the Family Court in Launceston guarantee that a judge would be based in Launceston and they would guarantee the future of the Family Court. But where do they stand on that issue? Nowhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there was the tax office issue. Mr Smith initially said: `That was a decision under a Labor government'- another very misleading position. We in government never received any report from the Australian Taxation Office with regard to the rationalisation of any regional tax offices&mdash;none at all. Then the Industrial Relations Commission intervened and brought a stay of execution for the closure of the Launceston tax office. But Mr Smith endeavoured to turn that into a positive for himself by misrepresenting the situation&mdash;again not checking the facts. He chose to say: `This is under review.' What has Mr Smith done about it?  Absolutely nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the very important things on which Mr Howard, on 7 February, promised the people of Tasmania was the issue of the Bass Strait passenger subsidy, or the car subsidy, as it is probably more commonly known&mdash;$49.5 million over a three-year period. Just after it was launched by Senator Newman I obtained a copy of the Bass Strait passenger vehicle equalisation scheme from Senator Newman's office. It says under the subheading `How it works':</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rebate is linked to passenger vehicles. A rebate of up to $150 one way is payable for fares paid for the driver and the vehicle where the fare exceeds $150.</PARA>
<PARA>Recently I obtained copy of a similar document which says under `How it works':</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rebate is linked to passenger vehicles. A rebate of up to $150 one way is payable for fares for the driver and vehicle where the fare exceeds $150.</PARA>
<PARA>Then:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first $150 is paid by the driver.</PARA>
<PARA>I made some inquiries about that. It would appear that the coalition is now saying that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> any person has to pay the first $150. That is a total contradiction of the election promise, Senator Newman knows it. Warwick Smith knows it. All of the Tasmanian Liberal senators and MHRs know that that is simply not what they promised to the people of Tasmania in the first instance. Moreover, they say: `This is an equitable process. Bass Strait must be treated as a highway.' And so it should; we agree with that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But let us look at how the subsidy will work. Despite the first $150, if you happen to be lucky enough to travel with more than one person&mdash;for example, if there are four of you in the car&mdash;at the existing off-peak fares it will cost you around $93 per person to travel with a car across Bass Strait one-way. If there are two people it will cost you about $86 per person. But if you happen to travel on your own you are up for $150. I do not know where the equity is in that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This seems to be a bit of a habit with Liberal members, but the state minister in the Tasmanian parliament somehow seems not to understand the fares that are to be paid across Bass Strait. He has got into the habit of misrepresenting the truth. He is quoted as saying that a one&hyphen;way fare of $87 is very good value. In fact, there is no $87 fare available. The minister should have known that the fare he was referring to is a return fare that costs $174. It is despicable that these members continue to misrepresent and mislead the people of this state&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over the past few weeks we have seen the higher education sector close to boiling point. It is worth noting that last week over 10,000 university students around the country took to the streets to protest against proposed funding cuts to the higher education sector by this government. Such a proposal lacks vision and also understanding of how our higher education sector works.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1167"> This week also marks a national week of action for the National Training and Education Union, which will go on an unprecedent ed 24-hour nationwide strike on Thursday, 30 May. The reason I raise this tonight is because today was an historic day for the higher education sector, with the launch of the Higher Education Alliance, formed in Canberra and launched today in Parliament House, I believe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth noting some of the groups that will be a part of that alliance: the National Training and Education Union, the National Union of Students, the Council of Australian Postgraduate Associations, the Australian Vice&hyphen;Chancellors Committee, the National Academies Forum, the Australian University Alumni Council and the Federation of Australian Science and Technology Societies. I understand that further academic and research bodies are represented&mdash;quite an historic coalition of groupings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On Friday, an historic meeting was held in this place. The Australian Democrats hosted a higher education round table which saw many of those groups that I have just mentioned brought together in the same place at the same time for what was really the first time. That group reached an interesting consensus if you look at the disparate groups involved in that meeting. It is worth noting that we came to a consensus, not just in opposition to some of the proposed attacks on the higher education sector by the new government, but a range of consensus was reached.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I read out a couple of the points that were achieved at that consensus meeting: first of all, the higher education round table agreed that public funding of higher education is in the public good. We also called on the new government to articulate its vision or its higher education policy for the sector. We also called on the new government to recognise the economic benefits, as well as the cultural, political and intellectual benefits that higher education brings to a country. This consensus meeting also pointed out that higher education, in terms of its export earning potential, is even more than that of wheat export for this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> I reiterate the fact that we reached consensus on the point of opposition to proposed funding cuts to our higher education institu tions. Staff, students, academics and vice&hyphen;chancellors all recognise that public funding of higher education is in the public good. We recognise that there are many benefits for education in this community: not simply social, political and intellectual but economic benefits, which are something that has been lost from the current debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats have looked on over the past 13 years and seen a higher education sector that has been massively underfunded. I am sorry that the coalition government, to this day, has not actually put forward any other proposals to see that our libraries are adequately stocked or that our academics and students receive appropriate resources for the higher education sector. In fact, over 13 years, as the coalition document rightly points out, in real terms education funding has decreased by about 13 per cent. Since World War II, there has never been a government that has cut higher education funding by more than one per cent in one year. This only happened once when Malcolm Fraser's razor gang tried to pursue the path that the current government is now pursuing.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, what I would like to see, Senator Panizza, is the coalition meeting its promises that are outlined in its higher education document that was launched and taken round the country in the lead&hyphen;up to and during the election campaign. On that note, the higher education round table, which met in Canberra on Friday, served notice that it would not accept broken promises by the coalition government; it would not accept a higher education system that excluded many people from being a part of this nation's future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note too, that this question has come up not only in question time today but over the last couple of weeks&mdash;including on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> where the minister, Senator Vanstone, gave an interview on Friday. There are lot of questions surrounding how the 12 per cent proposed funding cut figure has been arrived at. The latest relative funding muddle or model&mdash;it is a bit of a muddle&mdash;that has been put forward <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1168"> as a possible way that the 12 per cent figure was arrived has little to do with the relative funding model that applies to the higher education sector generally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are to pursue the model that has been proposed since Saturday's media reports, I ask: will we start seeing cuts to our higher education that revolve around the Hahn ice package, for example, which will constitute the 4.9 per cent cuts, or will we see top of the range cuts such as the South Australian bottle of Henschke, which is around 13 per cent, or perhaps the massive Jack Daniels package of cuts, which is around 43 per cent? Perhaps the minister responsible will go with the parochial package and stick to the South Australian home&hyphen;grown Coopers Ale package of 4.5 per cent cuts? The reason I bring up this, perhaps more light&hyphen;hearted approach to this debate, is because it seems that the minister has plucked a figure out of the air; that this figure was presented to the Australian vice&hyphen;chancellors' committee at a dinner, but we now know that that figure that was proposed, of between five and 12 per cent, is now being strenuously denied.</PARA>

I have already pointed out in this place, on a number of occasions, that 12 per cent funding cuts are the equivalent of the closure of five to six medium sized university campuses. Today, I pointed out that 48,000 student places could be lost if we cut our university sector by 12 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Beginning today, we have students who are outside the public entrance of Parliament House. What they will do between now and Thursday night, from nine till five every day, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is read out and hopefully remind the coalition government of its higher education funding commitments and proposals. I think that is probably a good note on which to end.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To conclude, I quote the coalition's higher education policy document, and I pick any page:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Coalition policy seeks to overcome these shortcomings&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>in our universities&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">by improving rather than substantially restructuring the sector.

While there is no recognition of Aboriginal Australia and no real acknowledgment of the fact that modern Australia is built on the lie of `Terra Nullius'&mdash;the concept that allowed powerful land grabbers to totally dispossess my people and made them beggars in their land&mdash;whilst there is no just and proper compensation for this loss there can be no reconciliation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1901 Federation to 2001.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the 29th anniversary of the Referendum I, along with many Aboriginal people, feel that we have achieved little in the way of freedom of self determination in this&mdash;our country. At the inception of Australia's Federation in 1901 Aboriginal people became Wards of the State and were basically incarcerated in the Aboriginal Reservations and missions that were set up for protection. Under management and police control they were denied the right to the very basic human dignity of self determination, education advancement and economic development through their dispossession.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This imprisonment was based on the grounds that Aboriginal people needed protection; from themselves, from the vices of white civilisation such as alcohol, gambling etc and from the advancing army of settlers and developing new townships. Men and women served in two world wars and other scrapes for this country yet came back to non-citizenship status and a licence, for those who applied, granting them a form of recognition. In fact since 1788 wars and battles were fought throughout this land for recognition as human beings and the right to survive let alone live as equals in this land that was fast being, then almost totally, usurped. Will this be still the case in 2001? <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Divide and conquer funding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What has changed? The Referendum of 1967 passed the Aboriginal people from State Government control to Federal Government control. Government still dictates to the Aboriginal people through their imposed funded bureaucracies and organisations such as ATSIC and Land Councils. We have Government orchestrated Reconciliation&mdash;while we, the Aboriginal people, are still denied basic human justice. The present government is barraged by its back benchers to maintain the lie that Modern Australia was built on. Even as you sit at lunch they demand to have the Mabo decision nullified and to be rid of the so called `Native Title' on behalf of the greedy pastoralist and development usurpers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the Liberal/National coalition came into office all Aboriginal people are being held accountable for the waste of `Tax Payers Money'. To us this is `Aboriginal Money' and we want all people to be accountable. Aboriginal people are being told that we must `Integrate', or whatever word used meaning to blend, into mainstream Australia because: `We are all Australians' that is of cause the 208 year old Australia that totally violated our people and destroyed our sovereign identity. I am Wiradjuri and I have thousands of years of history and heritage. Why should I take on a foreign history that endeavoured to totally annihilate my people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In regard to the Aboriginal people who have disagreed with the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs Mr Herron; He told Australia, through the media, that they were only `playing politics'. His attitude showed total disregard for the opinions of the Aboriginal people. Yet he is our Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The few billion dollars that have been thrown at the `Aboriginal problem' over the past 29 years have given some communities houses and helped in opening doors for Aboriginal people to get a better education. Some have their reserves back. Some have better employment opportunities&mdash;mostly in Aboriginal affairs or in training programs. But this is only the tip of the iceberg. Now this funding is under threat as services and education, employment and training programs are being targeted for cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Self determination.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The funding that is given to Aboriginal people is only on a communal basis. Most Aboriginal people believe that they must have 26 people on their committee before they can incorporate an organisation through ATSIC&mdash;this is actually stated on the incorporation form. This is discrimination as mainstream organisations only need a small committee and can be a family group. To me `self determination' means the right of the individual. But in Aboriginal affairs the individual cannot get <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1170"> a grant of money. If the person has an idea that he/she wants to develop they must go through an incorporated organisation and I have seen many lose their intellectual property as it gets taken and incorporated into the system. Their dream becomes the property of some one else. Through government funding Aboriginal people are controlled by those who make decisions on who is funded and who isn't.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If you want to maintain your dream you can apply for a `Business Funding Loan' through ATSIC that, in many cases, has taken up to two years to hear about, if ever, because of limited funds available. Furthermore, most Aboriginal people are shut out of this as you need to have a high percentage of your loan requirements in cash deposit or assets before you apply.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This form of assistance is in itself discrimination. Talk back radio and other areas of mainstream Australia tell us that the average Non&hyphen;Aboriginal person thinks that Aboriginal people are favoured above other Australians. To us refugees have better status and more opportunities and they have very little.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reconciliation? Are you planning a `Treaty' by the year 2001? Who is going to sign it on my people's, Wiradjuri, behalf? Who has the authority to sign away any of our land?

Moral and economic justice must be addressed before the year 2001, with a great deal of discussion with the Elders of all existing Aboriginal nations.

I believe that Miss Grant's letter speaks for <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> itself. I however did attend today's reconciliation week occasion and found it both moving and disturbing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is undeniable that there is an abundance of goodwill and good intentions on the part of many non&hyphen;Aboriginal members of our community and from many different sectors of this society. Nevertheless, it perturbs me that the word reconciliation can be used without the essential precursors of, for example, repentance, restitution, restoration of historical justice and forgiveness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Chairperson of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, Mr Patrick Dodson, said, Aboriginal people are not asking for guilt. But I do believe that the true meaning of reconciliation involves a much deeper, harder look at the history of this country and the present situation of Aboriginal people today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There seems to be an interesting counterpoint between this week's focus on reconciliation and last week's release of the government's discussion paper on proposed changes to the Native Title Act. On the one hand, we ask the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to join us in a process which should be directed to overcoming injustice, while at the same time we signal that we are prepared to add to that injustice and perpetuate it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard government has shown, very early in its time in office, that it wants to put Aboriginal interests in land at the far end of the queue, after all other interests in land have been satisfied. I do not believe the former government, in its priorities, was very different. It may have been in rhetoric, but I do not think it was in the position it put in place in the Native Title Act. That is the only construction we can put on the discussion, which in truth is primarily coming from other conservative governments, which calls on this government to extinguish native title on pastoral leases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the Howard government's motivation in its proposed amendments is to ensure that nothing gets in the way of development interests. Why else would the discussion paper canvass limiting the right to negotiate and increasing the exploration and mining <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1171"> rights of mining companies? And while this is all happening, the inquiry into the separation of Aboriginal children from their families is making its way around the country. Again, this is an issue which goes to the heart of the unjust relationship between indigenous and non&hyphen;indigenous people in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where, then, is the government's statement of commitment to this inquiry? Why have we not heard whether or not the inquiry will receive proper and adequate resources and time to do its job? The former government certainly did not resource the inquiry adequately, as has been demonstrated by the short time the inquiry has been able to spend in each of the places in which it has heard evidence to date. Counselling facilities available to witnesses who are in considerable distress at having to relive their experiences are also barely resourced, if at all. This was put bluntly in a press release by the Indigenous Advisory Council to the inquiry, which said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . without the full participation of Indigenous people, the inquiry can only tell a small part of the story. Full participation means having resources to prepare submissions, access records, travel to hearings and provide counselling support for the thousands of people being asked to relive the pain and anguish of those years.</PARA>
<PARA>Since this government came into office there has been a marked increase in the expression of racism in the community, much of it directed against Aboriginal people. Clearly, this cannot be blamed on the government. However, some of its statements foreshadowing changes to the ATSIC act or the Native Title Act would be seen by some in the community as a form of permission or support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">1996 is the United Nations Year for the Eradication of Poverty. There are no groups in our community who experience poverty of all kinds to a greater degree than our indigenous people. Surely it is an absolute pre&hyphen;requisite of reconciliation that we deal with this matter. I realise that this is easy to say but hard to achieve. But achieve it we must.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We hear a great deal about self&hyphen;determination, and coalition policy, I am told, says that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people `play a pivotal role in the programs and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> decisions which affect them'. I wonder how the government intends to put that into practice, as the early signs are not encouraging.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a crucial time in the life of our country. There are historical markers at many points of our nation's journey at present: the Mabo decision; the report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody; the reconciliation process; the forthcoming centenary of the Australian constitution and so on. Indigenous people have heard many promises, have read many policies and strategies. They are right to ask why it is that their situation is still a cause of shame to our wealthy nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe Miss Florence Grant had a point in refusing the invitation to attend today's lunch. I hope that she may witness a time when she feels comfortable in taking her full  <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1172"> and rightful place in the affairs of this parliament and this nation.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)(a) Removing the `loss of income' provisions would ensure that the maximum rate of payment would vary only with recipients' age and family status. It might also help to simplify administration but there is a risk that it would put some people in a more advantageous financial position than was the case before they became incapacitated for work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) The latest estimate of the cost of removing the `loss of income' provisions is in the order of $2.2M a year. This takes into account the number of people who currently receive other payments when the `loss of income' provisions prevent receipt of sickness allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)(a) The effect of exempting from these provisions people who had been in receipt of a payment under the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme (NEIS) immediately prior to claiming sickness allowance would be to pay sickness allowance at the maximum applicable rate, subject to income and assets tests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) The cost of exempting former recipients of NEIS payments from the `loss of income' provisions cannot be provided as my Department cannot identify the number of customers in receipt of payments under the NEIS prior to being paid sickness allowance. The cost of exempting these customers from the `loss of income' provisions is likely to be minimal. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1173">  </PARA></ANSWER></ANSWER.TO.QON>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1174">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The Constitution of the Carers Association of Tasmania Inc. (CAT) was developed by a Constitution Committee, following a statewide meeting of carers in March 1993. The Constitution was registered by the Office of Corporate Affairs on 25 May 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The Commonwealth Department of Health and Family Services does not provide any funding directly to the CAT. However, the CAT does receive Commonwealth funding through:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the Tasmanian Department of Community and Health Services, under the Commonwealth&hyphen;State Home and Community Care Program (HACC); the 1995&hyphen;96 approved upper limit for the CAT was $92,964; and,</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the Carers Association of Australia Inc., in relation to Carer Support information kits in English and in ten languages other than English; the 1995&hyphen;96 allocation to the CAT is $65,500.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth has an agreement with the Tasmanian Department of Community and Health Services concerning money provided by the Commonwealth under HACC, and an agreement with the Carers Association of Australia regarding Carer Support kit funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The Department understands that several complaints were lodged with the State department of Community and Health Services in August 1995, about financial irregularities and unconstitutional activities in relation to the CAT. The State Department advised the Commonwealth of these complaints.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result an independent audit of the organisation was undertaken. This audit revealed that the organisation was solvent with no major anomalies in their expenditure. However, one of the complainants expressed dissatisfaction with this outcome. The State Department then conducted their own audit which confirmed the original finding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The State Department has contacted the Association seeking clarification of some minor anomalies and requested a budget strategy for 1995&hyphen;96.
