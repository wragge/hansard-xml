<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased that I can speak on the Income Tax Rates Amendment (Family Tax Initiative) Bill 1996 and the Family (Tax Initiative) Bill 1996. This is legislation that to some extent is positive for families, albeit fleetingly, before a range of other measures introduced by the government actually start to bite.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is legislation that is something of a novelty. After all, it actually delivers to some extent on one of the government's pre-election commitments. So many of the other pieces of legislation that we have been considering from this government not only break election commitments but also are anti-family. The Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996, the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Newly Arrived Resident's Waiting Periods and Other Measures) Bill 1996, Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill 1996, the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill 1996 and the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Further Budget and Other Measures) Bill 1996&mdash;just to mention some of the key bills that are before the parliament&mdash;are all decidedly anti-family and are all going in the direction of destroying the fabric of the social safety net that we in the Labor Party worked so hard for, not only in maintaining but in strengthening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The family tax initiative was the centrepiece of the coalition's pre-election promises. The <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> coalition said this in its policy launch statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the greatest challenges of modern family life is to balance effectively work commitments and goals with family responsibilities and aspirations. Any credible family policy at a governmental level must be directed at helping families to achieve that balance. A Coalition Government will have this objective as one of its key priorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will put the needs of families at the centre of national policy-making. We will reduce the economic pressures on families (especially those with dependent children). We will increase the opportunities open to them. And we will give them more genuine choices about how they live.</PARA>
<PARA>As much as the government might like us to, the family tax initiative cannot be considered on its own. It must be considered along with the other measures announced by the government in their budget and taken in the context of a budget that impacts so heavily and adversely on families, particularly low income families. I am not sure that the family tax initiative does much to help families `to balance effectively work commitments and goals with family responsibilities and aspirations'. I do know that the measures contained in the workplace relations legislation will work against any such balance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said during the debate on that bill, the social costs of implementing the measures contained in the workplace relations legislation will have a devastating effect on families in Australia. It will dictate their level of income, their level of spare time and the way they manage their time&mdash;not only for themselves but for their families. Parents may have to work longer and more irregular hours, with less time to spend with their children and less capacity to organise adequate child care. Conditions such as paid holiday leave may be eroded. Weekend work may be foisted on workers. If maternity leave is written out of an agreement, women will be forced to return to their jobs or forced to give them up. The workplace relations legislation is a real Pandora's box of nasties that are not only anti-worker but anti-family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition claim that the family tax initiative will reduce the economic pressure on families. They also try to claim that it will increase the opportunities open to families <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and give them more choices about how they live. However, the choice families are offered by the coalition is not about real choice and opportunities but about forcing people to choose what they can afford and what they can really do without.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Their claim of reducing economic pressures on families becomes a farce when considered in the broader budgetary context. What they are giving with one hand in the form of the family tax initiative, the Howard government is ripping away many times over on the other hand, despite John Howard's assertion that that is not the case. In fact, over the next four years, John Howard's broken promises will take over $17 billion out of the community. That is well over twice the amount of money that is being given back to the community in election promises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality of the coalition's budget is that families will carry the greatest burden, even with this small bonus of the family tax initiative. They will face increased costs in child care, health and aged care and will bear the weight of reductions in funding for education, training and labour market programs. I ask: how can the family tax initiative be taken seriously when the government is at the same time pursuing so many other anti-family measures?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to take longer than the time allowed for this debate to detail every measure that will adversely impact upon Australian families, but let me take the Senate through some of the more serious measures and the ones that I have particular interest in in the area of social security.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Probably the most serious betrayal of families is the cuts to child care announced in the budget by the coalition. The government has decided to abolish operational subsidies for community based long day care centres. Soon community based long day care centres will have to face the choice of passing on the increased cost to parents withdrawing services such as baby places or extended hours or close. It is more choice, that is for sure, but none of them are attractive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decision not to provide capital funding to build 5,500 new long day care places means that these new places will simply not <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5694"> be provided. The restricted eligibility for child care assistance fee relief and the application of a means test to the child&hyphen;care cash rebate will mean that almost all parents will face high out of pocket expenses for child care. Low income families will be hit the hardest, despite the coalition's commitment to protect the most vulnerable in our community. These costs alone will more than offset any extra money a family may get from the family tax initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite promises to maintain all Commonwealth concessions, the government has provided no increase in the pharmaceutical allowance to offset the 50c per script increase in the prescriptions co&hyphen;payment. Families who benefit from concession cards will also have to pay $26 more each year for prescriptions for themselves and their children before they reach the safety net limit, when prescriptions become free and part of the family tax initiative will also have to pay for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can add dental care to the coalition's bill for families. What has been widely condemned is a mean and completely unnecessary measure: the government has abolished the Commonwealth dental health program so that families who hold concession cards will no longer have access to free dental treatment for the whole family. For families with members in receipt of a pension or allowance, there are a number of measures that will increase the economic pressures on families even more and certainly reduce the opportunities open to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For parents returning to work or study, they will no longer receive the employment entry payment or the education entry payment. The abolition of the earnings credit scheme will remove incentives for many parents to take up part-time and casual work&mdash;flexible work arrangements that allow families to balance their work and family commitments. The pensions and allowances lump sum advance scheme need has been restricted so that families who need an advance on their pension or allowance to help them make larger purchases or pay off large bills may now find it harder to access that finance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For families with one or more parents looking for work, the imposition of longer <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> waiting periods for unemployment payments will require parents to use up accrued leave such as long service leave and their savings before payments can be made. The government's vindictive measures to inflict harsher penalties for breaches of the activity test on unemployed people will leave many parents without any form of income support for long periods of time. Families will suffer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are also indirect burdens being placed on families. The increased charges and up&hyphen;front fees for nursing homes will place a large burden on families who, in a desperate attempt to get adequate care for their frail ageing relatives, may have to raise the money for significant entry fees or take on the burden of care themselves. On top of that, plans to offset the HACC program with increased user fees will hit the families of the people who benefit from HACC services. Mr Howard and Senator Newman have tried to woo families with this family tax initiative. However, as we start to add up the numbers we can see that the small benefits they are offering to families are totally eroded by their budget cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to briefly raise a point that was detailed by my colleague Mark Latham in the House of Representatives. That is the issue of bracket creep. For every $1 through the family tax initiative, average PAYE tax paying families will lose another $8.30 in bracket creep taken away through gross PAYE tax collections as families move into higher tax brackets of taxation because the government will not introduce tax indexation. There does not seem to be much left over, if at all, from the family tax initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me also say that this is not a simple piece of legislation. I do not hold it up as a piece of classic, clear, simple and accessible governance. Let me hasten to add that I do not in any way blame the drafters of the legislation for this. The policy that the coalition put to the electorate before the election was an extremely complex piece of policy. It has become more complex as the problems with the policy, for example, the income of the second earner, have seen the post&hyphen;election light of day.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5695">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On my part, and from the opposition's perspective, I believe this is a complex, unwieldy and unworkable system for delivering extra help to families. Let me give the Senate an example. Imagine you are a small business employing 20 people and every fortnight you calculate the amount of tax to deduct from their pay. At the moment this is based on how much you pay them less any rebates they might be eligible for. When this initiative is in place, the same employer will have to know for each of his or her 20 employees their domestic circumstances&mdash;how many children they have, how much their partner earns. It will be an administrative nightmare. This is from a government supposedly committed to reducing the administrative burden on small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party has no amendments to the workings of this legislation and will not be supporting the amendments of the minor parties. This is clearly and solely the coalition government's mess. I, along with others on this side of the chamber, look forward to debating the amendments to the tax act the coalition will inevitably introduce to try to clean it up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, the family tax initiative cannot make up for so many other measures that demonstrate the coalition's betrayal of the Australian people. They have broken promises. They have revealed their true colours on so many issues of importance to Australians. They courted voters giving them false hope and rhetoric about delivering to families, about protecting the poor, about protecting the needy and the most vulnerable in our community, about guaranteeing that no worker would be worse off under the new industrial relations legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The measures contained in so many other bills before this parliament go to the heart of Australian families and diminish their capacity to live a decent life. The family tax initiative does not even go part way to compensate. The opposition will be moving an amendment to the second reading of the Income Tax Rates Amendment (Family Tax Initiative) Bill 1996 to reflect the points that I have been making which my other colleagues here will make soon and which have been made by <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> opposition speakers in the House of Representatives. I move the following amendment:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the end of the motion, add "but the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> notes that only a limited proportion of family types receive the full benefits of the so&hyphen;called Family Tax Initiative;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> expresses its concerns that other budget measures leave the average Australian family substantially worse off;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> notes with concern that the Government is only returning to PAYE taxpayers a small proportion of bracket creep/fiscal drag revenue collections via this bill; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> expresses its concern that this and other Budget&hyphen;related measures have established very high effective marginal tax rates for non&hyphen;working parents returning to the workforce."</PARA>
<PARA>This amendment mirrors the one moved by the opposition in the House of Representatives. It reflects our belief and the increasing recognition in the Australian community that this budget takes from families a lot more than it gives in most cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment raises four points. Firstly, it notes that only a limited proportion of family types receive the full benefits of the so&hyphen;called family tax initiative. The family tax initiative works out to $3.85 a week for each dependent child and an extra $9.60 a week if the family has a child under five. Couples are only eligible for this additional payment if the second partner earns no more than $4,535 a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The family tax payments are means tested. Families only receive the basic payment if their taxable income is less than $70,000, plus $3,000 for each child after the first child. The extra payment for children under five is only paid if the main breadwinner's annual income is less than $65,000, plus $3,000 for each child after the first child.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead of providing a rebate for this amount, the legislation takes the rather unusual step of adjusting the income tax free threshold by $1,000 for each dependent child under the first part of the concession and by $2,500 if the family has a child under five years old. This has the same effect as providing a rebate, but for some reason the government has decided on this unusual step. I <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5696"> presume it is to reduce the comparison with the more generous family taxation rebates which applied under Labor, such as the spouse rebate, sole parent rebate, housekeeper rebate, the child component of the zone rebate and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second part of the opposition's amendment to the second reading expresses the Senate's concern that other budget measures leave the average Australian family substantially worse off. Of course, the Liberals hope that people will only notice the tax cuts that are written up in bold headlines and will miss all of the extra charges and cuts that are hidden away in the small print. Even after the cost of the family tax package is taken into account, the budget cuts $7.2 billion out of the economy over the next two years. No matter how John Howard and the Liberals try to hide it, the simple fact is that you cannot cut that much money out of the economy without having a big effect on ordinary Australians and their families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Howard has only been able to afford the family tax cuts and health rebates he promised in the election by making deep cuts to other services for Australian families. For every dollar that John Howard has given by meeting his election promises, $2.25 has been taken away by breaking promises alone. To make matters worse, the recent increases in the premiums charged by the health funds have substantially offset the benefit of the new rebates for private health insurance. While John Howard is giving tax cuts to families with one hand, the reality is that he is taking a whole lot more back with the other hand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third part of this second reading amendment is that the Senate notes with concern that the government is only returning to PAYE taxpayers a small proportion of bracket creep/fiscal drag revenue collections via this bill. As I said, the government is taking more in increases in PAYE taxation than it is returning to families by way of family tax relief and private health insurance. The budget papers show that gross PAYE receipts are to increase by 8.3 per cent this year. This represents an increase of $4.4 billion. This is an enormous slug on ordinary taxpayers and it compares with the total <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> amount being provided under the family tax initiative in 1996&hyphen;97 of under $400 million. Of course, there is no benefit flowing to families this year concerning private health insurance&mdash;only higher fees. Families know in this case that they are not better off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, this second reading amendment expresses its concern that this and other budget related measures have established very high effective marginal tax rates for non&hyphen;working parents returning to the work force. As I have said, taxation concessions are not phased out in the way that most social security benefits are. That is, they are either fully payable or not payable at all. I commend this second reading amendment to the Senate. Let us give this government a very clear message in relation to this bill and the broken promises of Mr Howard in his first short eight months in government. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The bill we are debating does, as Senator Faulkner said, put into effect the government's pre&hyphen;election promise of a $1 billion family payments benefit. That is what it does on paper, but the Democrats seriously doubt whether the entire budget package&mdash;including the family tax rebate and all of the cuts to health, education, social security, child care, aged care, dental care and so on&mdash;results in any net benefit to families at all. Because what this government gives it is already taking away, even without the help of the private health insurers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats believe that the mechanism chosen by the government to effect this rebate is quite flawed. Senator Margetts has prepared an excellent paper on the inappropriateness of the design of this tax initiative. We think she is quite right to argue that the government is creating unnecessary complication by creating something new rather than building on the existing taxation rebate system. But the Democrats would go further than Senator Margetts and argue that the government should have built this rebate on top of the existing parenting allowance system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We support the enactment of this pre-election promise but we do so with a little bit of reluctance because we remain unconvinced <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5697"> that the best and fairest way of assisting Australian families is through tax relief. Secondly, we think that it is very poorly targeted. We said that in the pre-election campaign. The government made some corrections to its design, but we still think the effect is that it is poorly targeted, and I will expand on that in a moment. The third reason for our reluctance is that the government has failed to use the opportunity to fund this rebate from a crackdown on tax avoidance and family trusts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All this adds up to a measure which, while offering some relief to low and middle income earners, and that has to be acknowledged, is also going to benefit some well off, even what we would consider rich, families at a considerable cost. We think that is the design flaw because we think that that cost could have and should have been avoided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not particularly good public policy and it is not particularly good family policy when you can identify these flaws. What it is is a good bit of election pork&hyphen;barrelling. The problem is that it now has to be paid for. The great disappointment is that, instead of paying for it, as I said, through cracking down on tax avoidance, we all have to pay for it through cutbacks in other essential services and programs.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XW4">Senator KERNOT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that is a very unfair choice. I think that is very badly designed, Senator Panizza. </PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats are concerned obviously with how the rebate will be paid for. It has been funded entirely by cuts to social security programs. Half of the payment&mdash;that is, $483 million&mdash;turns up as an outlay under social security, as this will be the part paid to lower income families, rather than through the tax system. The total amounts of cuts to social security payments will be $957 million in 1997-98&mdash;paying for the entire family tax rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Faulkner already pointed to the inherent unfairness of taking money away from the unemployed, from the sick, from the aged, from migrants and from indigenous <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australians to fund a rebate which will flow to basically every family in Australia. That is what I am saying&mdash;at what cost?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two&hyphen;income families end up about $3.75 a week better off; single&hyphen;income families are about $13.30 a week better off. That might look good on paper. It sounded good to people on budget night, but as the details have unravelled we have realised that that benefit will be more than wiped out by the loss of the Commonwealth dental program, the abolition of subsidies to community based child care, the increase in expenses under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, the cuts to nursing home assistance if there is an aged member of the family, the massive hikes in HECS charges, the cuts to Austudy and social security payments, the cuts to labour market assistance if a member of the family is unemployed, the cuts to ATSIC if the family happens to be an indigenous family, the cuts to public schools funding and the cuts to public hospitals funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Families will need every single cent of their $3.75 benefit to pay for all those extra user charges. In most cases, particularly where the family does have an aged, sick, disabled or unemployed person, they are going to need a whole lot more than $3.75 to offset the money this government is taking away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They call this a family budget, but as it unravels my feeling is that Australians will increasingly identify it as a `put your hand in the pocket for more money for families budget', because in fact it is anti&hyphen;family. People are not happy about getting $3.75 in one hand and, over the next two and three years, forking out five times that in order to keep up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5698"> The Democrats think the rebate should have been paid for by cracking down on tax avoidance using artificial income splitting through family trusts and other artificial arrangements. We agree that PAYE taxpayers carry too heavy a load in our tax system. The government could easily find more than a billion dollars by paying closer attention to those higher income families who are splitting their income and rechannelling their income to reduce their tax. We think this would have made a fairer and far more supportable pack age than the route chosen by the government&mdash;paying for it by cutting assistance to the aged, the sick, the unemployed, the indigenous and the poor. Where is the family focus in that for goodness sake?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also concerned at the way this rebate is quite poorly targeted&mdash;in other words, to whom it is paid. A two&hyphen;income family with three children could receive the full rebate with incomes of up to $79,000. About 95 per cent of families would receive that payment. The definition of income is taxable income, and that allows a whole range of tax planning loopholes to be used to reduce the income of a high income family sufficiently to pick up the payment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is just not well targeted enough. It is also confusing in that it adds several new thresholds, such as $65,000 for the part B benefit and $70,000 for the part A benefit, into the family payments area on top of the already established cut&hyphen;off for family payments of $63,766.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats think it would have been far simpler and fairer to base family tax payment eligibility on the family payment means test. If you had done that, the key differences would have been that it would start at incomes of $63,766 instead of $70,000, and that income would include a range of benefits high income earners take advantage of but which are not included in taxable income, such as not counting negative gearing losses, including any exempt foreign income and excluding households with assets of more than $500,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When these measures were introduced into the family payments system, they reduced the number of families receiving the payment by 10 to 15 per cent. That is a saving of, we think, about 10 per cent that is achievable here. That is $100 million. That is $100 million that the government would not have to squeeze out of other social security programs. I think it would be a much fairer targeting&mdash;particularly being mindful of what I have already said about how the rebate is being paid for&mdash;and I think it would be acceptable to families who already understand and use the family payments system.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, we have had the election; we are eight months down the track. We remember this government chose to make this initiative the centrepiece of their pre&hyphen;election promises. They got the big impact then. They are just hoping that nobody is going to pay too much attention about how it is paid for down the track. They are hoping that everybody is going to forget about all the little bits and pieces in the budget as the months pass. They want to say, `We said we would do this for families and we are delivering on it.' At the most simple level, that will work. But at the important level of who pays for it, how it is targeted, what its design structure is, it is not a good piece of legislation and it is not a good piece of public policy. It is just a good piece of politicking, and you know it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is one of the $6 billion of core election promises being kept. That sounds good. Do not forget that there is $12.5 billion of non&hyphen;core&mdash;this new term we got after the election&mdash;election promises that have been broken in the first six months. The delivery mechanism, the targeting and the method of funding the tax rebate might be flawed. They have taken a risk. It is on the government's head. They clearly think the politics of it are worth it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We support this bill with much reluctance. We think it could have been much better. We will support the opposition's second reading amendment because I think it does summarise the major flaws in this bill. It actually reflects the remarks that I have made in my speech.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that this government paints itself as a pro&hyphen;family government. It is interesting that we are enacting this piece of supposedly pro&hyphen;family legislation. Let us wait for the proof down the track of what families end up with in their pockets as a result of this initiative offset by the whole budget. Let us not crow too early.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I say at the outset that our amendments do not represent our preferred option. The family tax initiative was a clear plank of coalition policy in the election. We do not have any objection to doing things for families and children, but we do question giving tax breaks and benefits to people at a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5699"> time when government is ruthlessly cutting out or cutting back basic services, such as the Commonwealth dental program, higher education funding and pharmaceutical benefits. If government is so concerned with debt and spending that it must cut into services that equitably provide basic services that people expect of government, I think it is hard to justify giving tax sweeteners without increasing revenue somewhere.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At this stage, I mention that the opposition's second reading amendment will be supported by me, especially points 1 and 2 that note that only a limited proportion of family types receive full benefits of the so&hyphen;called family tax initiative, and that express concern&mdash;and this is a strong point, I believe&mdash;that other budget measures leave the average Australian family substantially worse off. I am less excited about points 3 and 4. I think they could be subject to debate but I believe the amendment is worthy of support and it is very important that those messages, especially the messages embodied in sections 1 and 2, get sheeted home to the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also have very basic problems with making things more complicated than necessary, especially the administration of tax and social security. If government wanted to grant a benefit, it could have added an extra $7.70 to the fortnightly family payment or, if it wanted a more targeted benefit, it could have added the $7.70 per fortnight to the additional family payment. This would have been straightforward and administratively simple. That is why I say this is not our preferred option. The disadvantage is that $7.70 per fortnight or $3.85 per week does not sound so enticing when compared to the draconian social policy of this government. But in real terms, this is what the family tax initiative will provide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead of taking the simple route, this government chose to make their sweetener sound artificially large. By changing tax thresholds, they could make what is effectively a $200 rebate into a $1,000 handout to families. Of course, reading bottom line figures, that is 20 per cent of $1,000&mdash;$1,000 times the lowest marginal ordinary income tax rate.  </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In doing this, the government made the choice to add administratively to social security by adding a third form of family payment, with a third set of applications and administration. It also started messing with income tax rates thresholds, making them vary with the particulars not only of individual taxpayers but also their families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I predict that this will create immense difficulties for the tax office, not only in calculating this but also in getting all the requisite information not only about a taxpayer but also about their family. I further predict that the cost of administering this scheme in the way government set it out will be substantial, and personally, I wonder whether $7.70 a fortnight in benefit will justify the cost of setting up two new structures to administer it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our preferred option would have been the simplest one&mdash;delivery of the benefit through one of the two existing systems of family payment. But the government has said that the basis of their scheme is clear. I know the opposition, while sympathising, feels it cannot make such radical changes in a scheme which the current government took to the polls. So our amendments do not represent our preferred option. The course we have taken is to try to preserve the government scheme, while transferring the tax treatment to a more workable form.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Greens (WA) amendments have an effect on the Income Tax Rates Amendment (Family Tax Initiative) Bill 1996 in two ways. First of all, they recreate the effect of the government bill in the Income Tax Assessment Act, rather than in the Income Tax (Rates) Act, which has significant effects in terms of simplifying taxation law and self&hyphen;assessment difficulties. Secondly, they create a taper for the rebates, rather than having a sharp cut&hyphen;off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effect of our amendment of the Income Tax Rates Amendment (Family Tax Initiative) Bill 1996 is mainly to make consequential amendments related to the change in the income tax rates bill. There is also an amendment to change the term `breadwinner' to `primary income partner' and `breadwinner's partner' to `lower income partner', and another change to eliminate sexist language by <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5700"> deletion of the reference to `opposite sex' from one of the definitions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By adding approximately two pages of text to the Income Tax Assessment Act, rather than over 20 pages to the Income Tax (Rates) Act, the Greens amendment preserves the rationale of tax legislation while reducing difficulties. The Income Tax (Rates) Act is a simple act designed to set the various rates at which different classes of taxpayers pay tax. This is the act that states the tax rates for residents, non&hyphen;residents, and so on. As such, the act is clear and straightforward. When a person moves from one class to another&mdash;for example, when a non&hyphen;resident taxpayer returns to residency&mdash;formulae are needed to assess their tax rates for the whole of the year. This act also provides such formulae.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Income Tax (Rates) Act was never designed to provide means of altering the rates with regard to specifics of individual taxpayers, the number of dependants, whether those dependants have incomes, and so on. This act has no provisions for dealing with taxpayers other than as broad classes. The purpose of this bill is to set the tax rates for those classes. It is the Income Tax Assessment Act which was designed to deal with all the individual variations of conditions for taxpayers. It is this act that determines deductions, exemptions, benefits, rebates and so on. It is this act that specifies when an individual taxpayer is assessable or exempt and under what conditions or variations. It is this act which defines things like eligibility of specific dependants and treatment of spouse income. It is the Income Tax Assessment Act which is the act under which the family tax initiative should occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Taxation law is already immensely complex and convoluted. It makes no sense at all to make it more so. The rates act has never been used in this way. To do so now will set a precedent and we may begin to see the rates act further modified to deal with a range of issues, individual variations, benefits and political promises. It is an attractive option, when a $200 rebate can be sold as a $1,000 gain in the tax&hyphen;free threshold. So it is about politics and selling a message, and it is about politics and disguising a message.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effect of this is to require the definition within the rates act of a range of particulars of eligibility, conditions and so on, duplicating what is already effectively in the assessment act. It also requires immensely convoluted methods where income thresholds may be moved far enough to shift the tax&hyphen;free area into higher marginal tax rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We see this in this bill, where government, to preserve the equality of the $200 rebate have, for example, had to create a 14 per cent margin for those who, through having over 14 eligible child dependants, might have shifted the threshold for the 15th child from the 20 per cent margin to the 34 per cent margin. Also, because rates vary with classes of taxpayer, complex formulae for calculating partial rates with movement of rates thresholds had to be provided, essentially with no purpose other than to preserve the benefit as a $200 rebate, rather than a legitimate change to the threshold of whatever system of rates the taxpayer was paying under.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is, as the Greens amendments show, far more simple and straightforward to call a rebate a rebate and put the changes under section 159J, which already deals with child and student rebates. This has the political disadvantage of stating clearly what is being done and making clear that this re&hyphen;establishes child rebates, which were discontinued in 1976. It also draws attention to the fact that the level of child rebates currently listed under the act, though unpaid, are $376 for the first and $282 for subsequent children, while the new rebate is only $200.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Child rebates were discontinued in 1976 in favour of child endowment which later became family payments and are paid through social security. They benefit those whose income is too low for them to benefit from a tax rebate. We see this government not only attempting to recreate the child rebate but also creating within social security a third family payment called the family tax payment. In our opinion, that is unnecessarily duplicative legislation. In point of fact, the entire family tax initiative could have been achieved by adding $3.85 per week or $7.70 per fortnight to the current family payment, instead of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5701"> giving any tax rebate, with a great deal less administrative expense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the issue of compliance, the government is certainly adding an additional burden on the Australian Taxation Office which must try to assess, simply, this shifting threshold model. Since taxpayers, under self&hyphen;assessment are ultimately liable for mistakes and are assumed to have knowledge of the law, this also creates a burden on taxpayers. Where a rebate can be simply handled by the addition of an extra line under the rebates section, the government method entails giving various confusing formulae for anyone who is not in the simple resident PAYE taxpayer class.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I feel the government approach is messy, inappropriate and liable to increase costs and problems. It opens up a whole new range of tax manipulations through threshold changes. I personally, and the Greens (WA), favour reducing the complication of the tax system, particularly where self&hyphen;assessment will create problems for taxpayers. I feel my amendments are far more appropriate than the government bill and urge other parties to support them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While table 2 in section 159J of the Income Tax Assessment Act is referred to in other portions of the act, and in other legislation, I have not found any cases where the amounts of rebate have been referred to. Only the class of rebates, which have been preserved, is referred to in any legislation we have seen so far. If there are implications within other pieces of legislation, we think they could be subsequently addressed through consequential amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have also applied the idea of tapers, already included in dependent rebates and family payment. I will cover that in more detail in the committee stage of the bill. While I think they are a good idea, I am willing to concede to their amendment if it means that my amendments will be accepted. So I am happy to break up my amendments so that we can vote on them separately.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My amendments do not seek to improve the intent of the government's scheme more than marginally. I understand that such a change would not get support. Our amendments are intended to at least save the nation from tax legislation that will be difficult to administer <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> or is possibly unworkable. They are intended to ensure that in starting new programs we do not dramatically increase the complexity, administration and compliance costs of tax legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that other parties accept the notion of an effective child rebate as proposed by the government. We, too, accept that there will be benefits to average families, particularly under the part A scheme. Some families, including some poor families, may benefit from the part B scheme, too, in spite of its obvious bias towards certain social groups. But I cannot sit still and allow legislation as badly designed as this to go out of this place without at least making an effort to make it workable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I realise, from the words so far of other senators, that it might be an object lesson for the government to allow them to stew in their own juice, to create a system which is unworkable and see how they are going to fight their way out of it. In some ways it is analogous to the situation with the ATSIC bill where I pointed out to the minister that, in their efforts to try to change the election while it was happening, they had changed the eligibility criteria. We pointed out the problem and saved the government, the taxpayer and ATSIC millions of dollars in trying to sort out the problem later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are making the effort, we have made the gesture, and it is open for the government to accept it. It is open for other senators to accept it. I urge other parties to support our amendments in the committee stage. I also understand the feeling that, if the government is going to be so stupid in doing something for a political advantage, people would like to see them take the rap for the stupidity of their approach.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We do not oppose this bill, but we certainly have major reservations about it. I rise to support the amendment moved by Senator Faulkner.

It has promoted the family tax initiative as a bonus for the families of Australia and New South Wales, the state that I represent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5702">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This tax initiative is not an adequate compensation for the massive cuts in services and the increased costs that the people of Australia will have to face as a result of what this government has done. Essentially, the proposed plans provide families with a means tested $3.85 a week extra in the pocket for each dependent child by increasing the tax free threshold.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us get a real grasp of the generosity of this $3.85. If you are lucky, for $3.85 you can get an extra loaf of bread and two litres of milk. Such is the generosity of this government to families. It gives a family an extra $9.60 if it has a child under five and the second partner earns less than $4,500 a year. The families of New South Wales would require a much higher payment than this just to retain their present position. It is very small compensation for the cuts to services that this government introduced in its budget and for the increased costs in health, child care, education and a vast array of other areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The family tax initiative fails to deliver real benefits to the families of Australia. It fails to improve the financial position of families. In fact, as a result of this bill and the budget, families in Australia are worse off. The coalition offered, with a lot of fanfare and razzamatazz, the family tax initiative even though it does not come close to compensating for those extra costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition further said in its policy document that a coalition government will work to maintain and strengthen the central role of the family in our society. The Treasurer (Mr Costello), in his second reading speech on this bill, said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The family tax initiative is a clear example of the government's commitment to giving families greater choice in how they spend their hard&hyphen;earned cash and in how they juggle work and family responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA>I will come back to this issue later and show that it is really a complete fallacy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition has failed on both these counts. The family tax initiative does very little to strengthen the central role of the family in our society. It is a moderate increase in the tax free threshold which does <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not, as I have said, compensate for the extra cost imposed by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part A of the proposal provides an increase in the tax free threshold of $1,000 for each dependent child, and they must be under 14 or up to 18 in full-time education. Families that earn less than $70,000 will get $3.85 a week for each dependent child. Part B of this initiative will provide one income families where one parent earns up to $65,000 and there is at least one child under five with an additional increase in the tax free threshold of $2,500. So that is $3.85 plus $9.60&mdash;not really a very princely sum, is it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there are two parents, the second can earn only $4,500 to be eligible, which means that any family where the second person is working more than a few hours a week is automatically excluded. In fact, only 13 per cent of families in Australia are eligible under part B of this initiative. I think that is a pretty clear statement of the fact that this government is out of touch. When it talks about battlers, it really does not know whom it is talking about because it thinks that the battlers, the mainstream of Australia, are this small group of 13 per cent that it said are the real Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What families are facing, which outweighs the benefit of anything contained in this package, are greater costs&mdash;greater costs brought about by decisions of this government. Let us have a look at the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The government has increased charges under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme&mdash;$2.60 for every prescription for all families. Even the less well off in community and the vulnerable in our community&mdash;pensioners and health card holders&mdash;have to pay an additional 50c per script.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only that, but this government has also broken the nexus between the pharmaceutical allowance provided to social security recipients and the additional cost paid for pharmaceuticals. So the government has said, `As we no longer accept that we have a responsibility to cover the costs of those vulnerable and older people in our community, we have broken the nexus.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I go back to families. A family can often have a number of children sick at the same <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5703"> time if they have caught something like mumps or measles, which are still quite common diseases these days, and it may have to fill up to three scripts. That family would have to pay $60 out of their pocket extra to what they would have had to pay previously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Child care is an issue of great concern to families at large&mdash;a principle that this government seems to have discarded. The fact is that the majority of families have both people in work&mdash;in fact, over 50 per cent. That is the norm in Australia these days. Child-care costs will now rise because of decisions that the Howard government has made. Families who have children in community based child-care centres will be paying an additional $25 to $30 a week for each of those children. The quality and availability of child care will decline and parents will have fewer choices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sad thing about the undermining of the community based child-care sector is that community based child-care centres play two important roles&mdash;they are very important for me as a parent and, I think, for most parents. One is that they are a check on the quality of care and the other is that they do the most to provide child care for children under two years of age. If you have a very young child, you will know how very difficult that is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has cut $500 million from expenditure on child care. The government has also tightened eligibility for child-care assistance and the child-care cash rebate. The government has also overturned the hard-won principle that child care is a legitimate work related expense by introducing a means test on the child-care rebate. There is no means test for other work related expenses, such as books or tools, but women in the work force who have to take up child care do have a means test imposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the changes that have been imposed by this government in the area of nursing homes. It is a very hard decision for a family when they believe that a parent or an elderly relative has reached the stage where they should be placed in a nursing home. It is a time of great emotional difficulty and soul searching. This is difficult enough, but <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the financial changes that have been brought about in this budget make it even more difficult.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the estimates hearings of the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee in answer to a question on notice, the Department of Health and Family Services indicated that entry fees in hostels were on average $30,000 in New South Wales. This is the model that it is adopting for nursing homes now. In fact, the department estimated that Australia&hyphen;wide the average fee for entry into nursing homes would be $26,000. That is a fee that before the election of this government people did not have to pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has not placed a limit on this fee that the vulnerable family in search of a place for their elderly relative has to pay. There is no limit. It says that there is a de facto limit of $88,000. To me that is pretty steep and I do not think many people in the community would see that as reasonable. But that is not where the pain ends for those people who have a relative they need to place in a nursing home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you earn a small amount over the pension, then you have to pay a fee of $34 a week&mdash;$12,000 a year&mdash;for the privilege of being in a nursing home. That is a privilege you had for free before the election of this government. It is not just the elderly person who bears the cost; it is the whole family who bears the cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's justification in imposing these fees is, `They have them in hostels so why not in nursing homes?' But the fact is that the entry to a hostel is a choice that you have. In most cases, people do not have a choice about entering a nursing home. They are physically frail, they are ill and they do not have the support at home to remain there because of the extent of their frailty so it is compulsory for them to enter a nursing home. It is brought about by necessity. The government has chosen in these circumstances to impose these sorts of fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will now go on to the abolition of the Commonwealth dental health program, which really, for all the things that were expected from a conservative coalition government, shocked even us. It shocked us that you <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5704"> should see fit to abolish a program that provides dental care for those people who really are struggling out there in the community. You have said that these people are not entitled to dental care. I visited a dental health clinic the other day. I have to confess that there were not many silvertails out there. There were people in their 70s and 80s with bad teeth, some of them trying to get their teeth repaired and some of them needing false teeth. A couple of dozen of them sat out there waiting for some treatment which they would not be able to obtain at any other place because they cannot afford it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But this government saw fit to abolish that program. Previously you could get emergency care in a dental health clinic, usually within 24 hours, at the maximum three days, and you could get the run&hyphen;of&hyphen;the&hyphen;mill routine dental care in about eight weeks. But what is the situation now? You wait up to two weeks for emergency care and you are on the waiting list for routine care. By Christmas the waiting list is estimated to be two years. The reality of that is that there is no routine dental care for the elderly and the vulnerable in our community because of this government's decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The dental health cuts have already had a major impact. We have seen the other bonuses being offered by the government&mdash;the private health insurance rebate. What a great idea! Nobody has the benefit of that yet. It will come in about 1 July next year and is about $400 for a family. But already half of that rebate has been lost by increases in premiums for health insurance that this government has approved. So that particular budget item is a big zero for families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On top of the particular items I have had the opportunity to outline in detail, there are higher university costs, cuts to funding to government education and more costs associated with health and child care. In fact, there will be major increases in fees and charges imposed by state governments because of the run-on effect of cuts and decreases to payments to the states. A family with at least one child in a community child-care centre and a parent in a nursing home will be paying an additional $100 a week because of decisions <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> made by this government. If you happen to be a health card holder, you are even worse off each week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I guess I have to feel sorry for the Treasurer and the Assistant Treasurer who have to sell a deal where they say, `We'll give you $3.85 and we'll take $100; that is a pretty good deal.' If they manage to sell that, they are doing pretty well. Certainly, it is not a deal that most families in Australia who have pretty good commonsense would accept.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a further aspect of this bill that I find particularly concerning. This family tax initiative is an attempt at social engineering. It clearly indicates there is a preferred model of family. It does not accept that there is a wide array of families where family members have made different choices about their roles and their lifestyles. It says that there is only one particular valid model and that is the one that is indicated by this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe families, in all their diversity, are a caring and valid vehicle for the care of all their members. I believe all children, in no matter what type of family, are entitled to care, protection and assistance. Thankfully, the government has made some changes to their proposal. Initially, a family was to be excluded from any benefit if the non-bread winning spouse earned any income at all&mdash;that is, income from their actual effort, if they were working income earners. But for people who did not earn income by their own sweat, if they had up to $20,000 of unearned income, that was all right; they could still get the benefit. Thank goodness they saw the error of their ways in relation to that. I applaud that change. The government has now said that the non-bread winning spouse can earn up to $4,500.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under this bill, the situation is that a two-income family with two dependent children under the age of five receives no assistance under this proposal if one person is earning $39,000 and the other is earning, say, $36,000. In fact, they will be paying, as I have said, approximately an additional $100 a week because of this government's decision. But, alternatively, a one-income family with the father earning $68,000, for example, with two dependent children under five gets $17 a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5705"> week extra and does not pay any additional child-care costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a gap between the two families of about $70 a week just because they made different lifestyle choices and the second family did not conform with the appropriate model according to this government. But I guess that really does not come as a big surprise to a lot of people. A very interesting study called the Australian candidate study released recently revealed that 33 per cent of coalition candidates in the last election believed that Australia had gone too far in providing equal opportunities for women and 40 per cent did not believe the government should increase opportunities for women in business and industry. I guess this package brings about the effect of a lot of those candidates' views&mdash;that women had it too good under the previous Labor government and it is about time that process was reversed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not oppose this bill. We want to make it clear to the community that it is a farce&mdash;that you get $3.85 and they take $100 out of your back pocket. We do not believe that is a particularly good deal.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. The Howard government's family tax initiative must not be examined as a separate initiative designed to assist Australian families; it should be looked at in terms of the overall Howard budget. It is in this light that the real intent of the budget is clear. The family tax initiative is little more than a smokescreen to disguise other attacks on workers and their families. The tax initiative seeks to claim that the government is making Australian families far better off. This $3.85 per week is supposedly to make up for the evils of the first government budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When one looks though at other changes proposed in the budget, one becomes increasingly aware that the cover&hyphen;up attempted by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) cannot be allowed to continue. There are a series of significant problems and deceptions in Mr Howard's family tax initiative which are apparent in the following areas: the initiative's lack of support for families when considered against changes to child care; the initiative's lack of support for families when considered against changes to aged care; the initiative's lack of support for families when considered against changes to general health care; the initiative's lack of support for families when considered against government allowed increases in private health insurance premiums; the initiative's lack of support for families when considered against previous Labor government tax rebates designed to support families; and the initiative's lack of support for families when considered against state grants cuts attacking state hospitals and schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The family tax initiative will give families $3.85 per week for each dependent child. An extra $9.60 per week will granted where families have a child under the age of five. Importantly, the proposal really only deals with the granting of $3.85 per week. This is because at best only 13 per cent of the Australian community will be eligible for the second part of the offer. Why? The government has placed a $4,500 threshold on the second income earner. This threshold will easily be reached if a part&hyphen;time or casual worker works nine to 10 hours on a Thursday <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5706"> night and a Saturday. The result?  The exclusion of these families from the second rung of the offer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As previous mentioned, the tax initiative is really a deception. It gives with one hand and it takes with the other. The proposal means little when compared to the changes to child care made by Mr Howard. The proposed child care changes will take from families much more than the family tax initiative will give. This deception occurs in a number of ways. As members in the other place have already pointed out, the extra costs for families due to cuts in child care support by Mr Howard far exceed the benefit of the family tax initiative. A recent EPAC study on child care estimates that the cost of the cut proposed by the government in the operating subsidy for community based child care will cost families $21.40 per week for children under three and $14.35 per week for children older than three.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cuts are just as draconian for private child care. This side of the chamber has calculated that a family on an annual income of about $30,000 and with two children in long day care for 50 hours per week, will pay an extra $19.60 per week. If the same family earns $45,000 per year, they will pay $15.30 extra per week in child care fees. The result is that for low income families the $3.85 thrown at them by the Prime Minister through the family tax initiative compares very poorly with the $21.40 he intends to take away from them through additional child care costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The deception of this initiative does not stop at child care; the elderly are not safe from the attacks of the Howard budget. The changes in this area have already been much publicised and attacked by the Labor Party and the community in general. However, they still deserve a mention in passing. Mr Howard will charge the elderly $34 per day for nursing home fees. This is in addition to the $26,000 up&hyphen;front entry fee now proposed by the government. Unfortunately, the attacks on the elderly do not stop there. The Commonwealth dental program, which the Prime Minister promised to maintain at its real value, has been cut by the budget. The result will be an increase in waiting lists for health care card holders. Prescription prices for <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> health care card holders will also increase. This increase will mean that prescriptions will cost an additional 50c, so the price will rise from $2.70 to $3.20. Home and community care programs will move toward a user&hyphen;pays system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Twenty per cent of the cost of home care will have to be paid for by those who most need the care. This will affect programs such as meals on wheels, which will cost anywhere between $4 per hour and $6.30 per hour. For an elderly person who has three meals on wheels per week at the upper limit of $6.30 per hour, there will be cost of approximately $1,000 per year. This will also have an impact on the family tax initiative for children: it will mean that couples with elderly parents will dig into their own pockets to ensure their parents are adequately looked after. The cost will be far greater than the miserable $3.85 per week that Mr Howard will throw at them. If couples have to find $34 every day to ensure adequate care for their elderly parents, the $3.85 from the family tax initiative can only be considered a sick joke.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are number of other health cuts which take from families who have children more than the family tax initiative will give. As already outlined, the cost of prescription drugs for families will increase from $17.40 to $20. Hospital funding grants to the states will also be cut. Additionally, the cost of eye, knee and appendix operations will increase. The increase in the cost of prescription drugs leaves $1.25 for the family from the tax initiative. However, the damage goes even further. As anyone with children knows, kids get sick at the same time. Consequently, the caring parent usually catches the virus. Prescription medicine for the sick children and the carer will cost the family no less than $80 in one hit. God help them if the prescription requires repeats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Add this to the fact that bulk&hyphen;billing is in danger due to the government's failure to adequately compensate doctors and the health rebates being eroded by government sponsored premium increases in health insurance, the availability of medicine becomes a questionable issue. As just mentioned, private health insurance premiums will also take more <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5707"> from families than the Howard tax initiative will give back. The family tax initiative will in no way encourage participation in private health insurance nor will it go in any way towards assisting with the increased premiums from the major funds that the government has allowed and supported. These increases put the final nail in the coffin when it comes to Mr Howard's attack on health care for families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How will these increases affect families? For example, a couple in New South Wales, who will get a rebate from the government for private health insurance, will have their premiums increased by $306. Two&hyphen;thirds of this $450 rebate will be wiped out for families with dependent children. These increases destroy any benefit from the private health insurance tax rebate. When comparing the increase of the health insurance premium to the health rebate, the $3.85 per week family tax initiative does not even deserve a mention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The introduction of the tax initiative by way of increasing the tax free threshold is curious in itself. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition summed it up best when he surmised that even if it were introduced as a rebate, it would of course be compared with all other rebates&mdash;those introduced by the previous Labor government. When compared with these, the Howard rebate would appear pathetic. All of these increases far exceed any moneys given to families through the family tax initiative. The Howard government will attempt to deceive the Australian people by taking up the $3.85 per week family tax initiative. Meanwhile, they publicly ignore the child&hyphen;care cuts, the health care cuts, the aged care cuts and the increases in private health insurance premiums, while the office of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) gleefully adds up all they have taken from Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These cuts mentioned are, of course, just the tip of the iceberg. There are a number of other areas in which the federal government has made cuts destroying the credibility of assistance through the tax rebate. These all destroy any assistance that the $3.85 per week tax rebate would provide. For example, in relations between the Commonwealth and the states, there has been an enormous reduction <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in the grants made to the states. The result of this will be to reduce the quantity and quality of services that the states are able to provide. Areas such as hospitals, schools and TAFEs will be affected. Already in some states primary schools have leased some of their land to groups such as mobile phone companies for aerial reception purposes just to raise enough money to pay the school's daily bills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the cuts to state grants by the Commonwealth, this situation can only get worse. States such as New South Wales, for example, are already grappling with the problem of federal funding being insufficient for service provision. In New South Wales, Mr Carr has been forced to introduce the Howard&hyphen;Costello tax in a number of areas just to continue current essential service provision in that state. These increases have occurred in areas such as land tax, payroll tax and stamp duties on motor vehicles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Howard and Mr Costello do not escape criticism from their colleague Mr Kennett and his government either, although this is nothing new. The Victorian government has been forced to postpone tax cuts in that state in order to pick up the tab left by the cuts in funding by the federal government. I will repeat a quote of Alan Stockdale, the Victorian Treasurer, already made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) in the House of Representatives. Mr Stockdale said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These burdens flow through to State taxpayers and they'll have to fund these burdens, and Mr Costello is taxing them by stealth in flagrant breach of his election commitment, upon which he was elected with an overwhelming mandate by the people.</PARA>
<PARA>If this coalition government has any mandate at all, it is not to slash services provided to our community by the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has been the Prime Minister's response to these concerns and criticisms? In question time in the House of Representatives on Monday he castigated the opposition for daring to say that a package of $3.85 per week, while all the other costs previously mentioned are increasing, was not enough for Australian families. The Prime Minister believes that $3.85 per week is an excellent <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5708"> return to the Australian community for the suffering that will be inflicted by the other wide range of cuts proposed by his government. Clearly, the Howard family tax initiative can be seen as nothing more than a deception of the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The wide range of cuts mentioned in health care, aged care, child care, higher education, private health insurance increases and cuts to the states, which will affect schools and hospitals just for starters, are all devastating on their own. As a combination, as Mr Howard has surely intended them to be in order to increase tax receipts, they will push many families over the edge. The quality of the lifestyle and the quality of education and health care for their children will be greatly decreased.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The devastation of these cuts and the impact they are about to have is evident in my home state of Western Australia. Anticipating the full impact of the Howard budget cuts and the cuts in federal grants to be realised in early 1997, the Premier, Mr Court, has called an unprecedented early Western Australian election in an attempt to avoid any political backlash that will stem from the cuts and Mr Court's support of them. By calling an early election before Christmas&mdash;the first since 1905 in Western Australia&mdash;Mr Court will avoid the commencement of the Howard budget cuts coinciding with the state election campaign. This is a further example of state Liberals attempting to distance themselves from Mr Howard's budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The family tax initiative cannot be considered a supportive step for Australian families and the Australian community. It will provide little solace for those bearing the full brunt of Mr Howard's budget cuts. That is why it is a deception. However, its attempt to cover up the broad range of cuts only serves to allow the opposition a chance to highlight the severity of the cuts even further.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to close the debate on the Income Tax Rates Amendment (Family Tax Initiative) Bill 1996 and the Family (Tax Initiative) Bill 1996. I wish to thank all the contributors for their contributions, although they were of varying <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> quality. Some, particularly the last ones, seemed to be more concerned to get a few issues up on the state election front rather than make a serious analysis of the bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These bills give legislative effect to the family tax initiative, the centrepiece of the coalition's family package, to ease the tax burden on low and middle income Australian families with children. Lower income families will have the alternative of the fortnightly cash assistance. The initiative recognises the cost of raising families and offers families a choice in whether one parent wants to stay at home and care for children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition framed the policy to acknowledge the central importance of the family and to give them hope for the future after 13 years of Labor policies and neglect. Consistent with our election policy, the initiative is being delivered as an increase in tax-free thresholds rather than as a tax rebate, the alternative which is preferred by the Greens. The initiative will give a major boost to almost two million Australian families with dependent children and is being delivered in full and on time. The initiative is a $1 billion a year direct injection into the pockets of Australian families starting on 1 January 1997, which makes the comments that Senator Bishop just shared with the chamber even more curious.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two methods of delivery for the family tax initiative: first, through the income tax system as adjustments to the tax&hyphen;free threshold called the family tax assistance; and, second, low income families will receive the family tax initiative as a direct fortnightly payment, called the family tax payment, from the Department of Social Security. Some 900,000 families will receive an immediate boost to their disposable income through this measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5709"> During the debate of the bills in the House, a number of incorrect statements were made by members of the opposition about the family tax initiative. I would like to take this opportunity to briefly dispel some of the myths that have been peddled by the opposition. Firstly, let me reassure the Senate that the family tax assistance will benefit around two million Australian families with children out of some 4.9 million families with chil dren. The cost of the initiative is about $1 billion in a full year. The cost is made up not only of the cost of the increased tax threshold but also of the family tax payment paid through the Department of Social Security.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, some members of the opposition&mdash;most notably the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans); the shadow assistant treasurer, the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham); and the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence)&mdash;have also incorrectly claimed that part B of family assistance will benefit only 13 per cent of families. They are unable to do simple maths. They seem to have inadvertently omitted that low income families will receive cash payment from the DSS instead of tax assistance, as they have excluded single-income families. If you eliminate the opposition's errors, using their figures 27 per cent of families will be eligible for part B assistance, not 13 per cent. When you compare this with the total families with children, the percentage is 54. Even higher is the percentage of families with children under five.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, contrary to statements by the member for Werriwa that single parents do not qualify for part A of the benefits, they indeed do, provided the family income test is met. Single parents may qualify for both parts A and B.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I do read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  of the other place, even the odd speech by members of your own side. The family tax initiative recognises that not all Australian families are identical. It recognises the wide range of family structures in Australia. As well as nuclear families, it accommodates sole parents, grandparents caring for grandchildren and foster families. However, part B of the initiative provides additional assistance to those with young families. We make no apologies for that extra help.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not surprisingly, members of the Labor Party also made some unfounded assertions that the government has given a few dollars with the family tax initiative but taken back a lot more with the budget. That was a theme raised by a number of opposition senators. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Firstly, and most importantly, the budget was carefully designed to rein in the large budget deficit created by 13 years of Labor fiscal irresponsibility. Labor failed the task of reducing its budget deficit to a sustainable level. As a result, families have been forced to pay higher interest rates than they otherwise should, and more and more of the taxes paid by ordinary Australians must be used to pay the interest on government debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The government's deficit reduction program is an integral part of its ongoing commitment to families. Already, Australian families are benefiting from falls in interest rates. Lower mortgage repayments are substantially benefiting families across Australia, leaving more money for other expenses. Lower interest rates will also assist families who are in small business and who are primary producers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Our industrial relations reforms will lead to more real jobs for Australians: jobs for mums and dads and young Australians. In the budget, we also honoured our election commitment to make private health insurance more affordable for lower and middle income earners. From 1 July 1997, families with dependent children with private health insurance will benefit from an incentive of up to $450 per year provided as a reduction in premiums or as a tax rebate. We have maintained Medicare in its entirety, including bulk-billing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has demonstrated its commitment to affordable, flexible and high quality child care. The government's child-care package will provide greater choice for families. We have allocated $256.6 million over four years to retain the operational subsidy for family day care. We have provided $195 million over four years to retain the operational subsidy for occasional and outside school hours care. We have provided $10.9 million over four years to fund services targeted to rural and remote regions and disadvantaged areas. The government has maintained child-care assistance and the child-care cash redate, whilst making adjustments to remove some anomalies and to better target assistance to families with the greatest need. These adjustments will reduce subsidies to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5710"> high income families and protect low and middle income families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I believe that Australian families, who will start to receive the benefit of the FTI election commitment in their hands from 1 January next year, will realise that this government is committed to Australian families. We will not be supporting the second reading amendment moved by Senator Faulkner for all those reasons which I have outlined. We will not be supporting the Greens' amendments to the bills. The government has introduced legislation to reflect its election commitment, which promised tax relief in the form of an increased tax-free threshold. That is what we have delivered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, in relation to Senator Kernot's comments, the government has delivered on its election commitment in the manner that was taken to the Australian public during the election campaign. These bills before the parliament are important. They are bills which give effect to one of the centrepiece election promises the government made. I urge the Senate to support the bills.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the course of this period of sittings I expect to be drawing attention to several instances of government amendments to bills being presented as requests when, under the past practices of the Senate, they should be moved as amendments. The interpretation and application of section 53 of the constitution, which determines whether the Senate makes amendments or requests for amendments to bills, has been under examination by Senate and House of Representatives committees, and recently the Procedure Committee presented a report on the subject.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5711"> The government drafters have been preparing government amendments as requests in accordance with their own interpretation of section 53. This interpretation, however, has not been accepted by the Senate and is con trary to both the past practice of the Senate and the recent recommendations of the Procedure Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of this bill, which is not a bill imposing taxation, two of the government amendments have been submitted as requests on the basis of the notion that an amendment should be a request if it might have the effect of increasing the taxation payable by any category of taxpayers. Such amendments have not been treated as requests by the Senate in the past and would be treated as requests under the Procedure Committee's recommendations only in the context of other parts of those recommendations. One of the recommendations is that any amendment which would increase tax payable should be moved in the House. I therefore consider that all of the government amendments should be moved as amendments.</PARA></INTERJECT>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find that fascinating because if that is the advice that Treasury has given you then perhaps Treasury should have a look at it again. If you have a look at what actually occurs here, the bill is introducing a $200 child rebate, not a $1,000 addition to the tax free threshold.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to get this clarified before we start. To explain it to you, minister, because I know you and the government would be interested in it, I believe that occurs because the amount of income a taxpayer can earn above a family tax threshold at the lower marginal tax rates is being compressed. If it was a genuine $1,000 addition to the tax threshold, it would not be compressed. A single taxpayer can earn from $5,400 to $20,700&mdash;a band of $15,300&mdash;and pay only 20 per cent tax. A family taxpayer with three children will get a tax threshold of $8,400 but only be able to earn $12,300 at a 20 per cent tax rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To put it another way, the bill is making family taxpayers pay for their family tax thresholds through a sharp analog of bracket creep. I just wonder whether the minister would care to comment on that. Is this bill in effect providing for a $200 child rebate? Let me say, minister, that I applaud the initiative so far as it was put forward. I believe the government intended it to be an increase in the tax threshold, but presumably once Treasury got to it, they simply made it a tax rebate. Nevertheless, I do congratulate the government for its initiative. I was very surprised, in fact, that it did not have a raft of speakers on its side of the chamber applauding its action. It is clear that this action has touched a chord in the hearts of a lot of families, who have, in fact, responded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you want to take this on notice, minister, and examine what has come out of the bureaucratic churning that has gone on, what you have got now is not an increase of $1,000 in the tax threshold but a $200 tax rebate. That is a matter that was alluded to by Senator Margetts quite clearly in her speech on the second reading debate. I was rather surprised to hear you say in your response to the second reading debate&mdash;even after Senator <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5712"> Margetts raised the matter&mdash;that you still maintain it was an increase in the tax threshold.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will deal with the points Senator Harradine made not entirely in sequence because I was very taken with the concluding remarks made in relation to the very strong support he is providing to this initiative by the government. You correctly said, Senator Harradine, that it had touched a chord in the community. You raised the issue of the speakers in relation to the Income Tax Rates Amendment (Family Tax Initiative) Bill 1996. Let me assure you that we are very proud of this bill. It is a bill that was welcomed during the election; it was welcomed during the Lindsay by&hyphen;election. I do not normally wish to raise those embarrassing issues as far as the opposition is concerned, but it has clearly identified this government as a pro&hyphen;family one. I certainly welcome the comments that you have made and the support you have shown.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the other matter, the bill does provide an increase in the tax&hyphen;free threshold, and that is actually shown in its schedule. I understand that you seem to have some concerns about that, although it seems to involve a matter of form rather than substance. The bill does increase the tax&hyphen;free threshold; the benefit of the increase is delivered at 20c in the dollar in all cases, even where the threshold extends into the 34c tax bracket. This will keep the delivery simpler. Senator, you asked me whether I would take your comments on notice. I will certainly see whether there is anything I can add to that. I will provide you with some advice. We welcome your strong support for the bill; I think it is shared throughout the Australian community, although, not entirely surprisingly, not without qualification on the other side. I table the supplementary explanatory memoranda relating to the government amendments to be moved to this bill and the Family (Tax Initiative) Bill 1996.

<PARA>I did give my reasons for making these amendments during my speech on the second reading, so I will not belabour that point. I just wish to say again that this family tax initiative creates fundamental problems within the nature of tax laws by changing thresholds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will say more about the tapers which we would like to see applied by our amendments. This is the only real area of divergence from the government's scheme. While I do not think the current section 159J or the current government scheme are the best options, we have attempted to faithfully duplicate the intent of the government bill, with one exception. This exception is to provide tapers, as is usual for rebates, under 159J.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A taper provides a means to avoid the situation where, with an increase of $1 in assessable income, a taxpayer loses several hundred dollars of benefits. In the case of the family tax initiative, we have constructed the taper so that, in regard to maximum family income, the rebates phase out over the last $5,000, terminating at the government's proposed sudden&hyphen;death level. In other words, for a family with one child of 10 years, the rebate will begin to reduce at $65,000 of assessable income and disappear at $70,000 per annum. For a family with a child under <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> five, the additional $500 rebate begins to cut out at $60,000 and is gone by $65,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will stop here to point out that the current level at which the minimum family payment cuts out is about $64,000 for a family with one child. So the $70,000 limit for this rebate is higher than that. I also point out that the old additional family payment, which is now incorporated into family payment as maximum family payment, had a taper. It begins cutting out at around $22,700 and reduces by 50c in the dollar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government plan imposes a spouse income limit in respect of only the $500 rebate. Under my amendments for the rebate of $500 when you have a child under five, the spouse's income would taper off at 25c in the dollar for income above the government's proposed level&mdash;that level at which the government seeks to cut out benefit&mdash;above $4,500 per annum or $86 per week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the large number of women in low&hyphen;income families who may have part-time work, we do not feel that these people should be penalised with a sudden&hyphen;death cut&hyphen;off above that level. To do so runs counter to many of the recent changes in social security legislation which recognise the importance of not creating disincentives to increasing part-time work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A loss of $500 worth of benefit would be a major disincentive to any but those with a substantial increase in income. Personally, I find this part of the scheme to be discriminatory. When the ordinary family payment assesses family income, the dependent child income, it does not assess the income of one partner relative to the other. The government bill is designed to provide benefits specifically to families where one member is dependent on another. It will discriminate against a family with two working parents in low income jobs to give a benefit to someone making more than both the two pooled parents because they have a spouse at home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is designed to foster dependency and there are no prizes for guessing which gender is supposed to be the dependent one. Fundamentally, I find this section unjust. If I thought for a moment that the other parties would support me, I would have eliminated <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5717"> the spouse income test and had only the family income test. All the high income, single income people would still have received the benefit. A family with one working partner on $60,500 and a non&hyphen;working partner getting an income from a trust of $4,400 and a family income of $64,900 would still get the government $500 rebate, although they would be ineligible for minimum family payment if they had only one child.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Such a change to total family income payment would also have included all of those families who are not rich and where both partners need to work. For example, if one partner makes $25,000 per year, which is $400 per week, and their spouse makes $100 per week or $5,200 per year for a total family income of $30,200, under this government bill, this family will be excluded. They will not get a brass razoo of the $500 rebate although they are still eligible for additional family payment to low income earners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I point to this as a very regressive and unjust aspect of the bill. It abandons many of the battlers of this country while giving largess to the rich who can afford to have only one working spouse. It is an intentional action by the government, not an oversight. It is intended to support an obsolete notion of the ideal family of the 1950s, with dad working and mum at home with kids. Coupled with the way this government is attacking wage&hyphen;earners in the workplace relations act and the way they are attacking the unemployed in social security, the jigsaw pieces fit together to create a grim picture for the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For child incomes, the Greens have also introduced tapers. These correspond to the current taper levels for dependents in the Income Tax Assessment Act. This is 25c in the dollar and, for the part A benefit, my amendment would start the taper at an income level $800 less than the government limit, cutting out at that limit. I have had to do it this way because the child income limit is a variable based on the Social Security Act. These limits are approximately $6,700 per annum or $129 per week for an eligible child over 16</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA>and $6,500 per annum or $125 per week for children under 16. In respect of the $500 rebate for children under five, we would set a 50c in the dollar taper, starting $1,000 below the government's limit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the government's scheme, the child income level for such infants and toddlers will be around $6,500 per annum or $125 per week for those under 16. Our proposed taper on income limits would therefore start at a child income of $5,500 per year. This is actually higher than that allowable for the child's second parent. Remember that this is a child under five.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government proposal for the child's maximum income level is certainly not intended to benefit the poor. This particular measure is another sign of the government's agenda to create certain advantaged families. A family with a wealthy dad, non&hyphen;working mum and the ability to direct a family trust to pay mum $85 per week and a two&hyphen;year&hyphen;old baby an income of $124 per week will obviously be the big winner. Those families with two working adults both making an amount over $90 per week with a young child will be excluded from part B benefits, which were obviously intended for a selected group of well&hyphen;heeled constituents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summation, the rates act was clearly not designed or intended to deal with the particulars of eligibility for variations to taxation. It establishes the underlying rates. The assessment act was designed specifically to deal with application, assessment and exceptions based on personal tax variation. It was also designed as a vehicle for government benefits, incentives and disincentives in relation to taxation. It is the act that is designed to assess the tax obligation of the individual taxpayer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is wrong to seek to implement its programs through changing tax thresholds. It will place a major burden on the tax office and will probably result in problems to taxpayers. It is against all efforts to simplify tax legislation and make it more logical. I urge the government to save itself problems and to adopt our amendments. I urge other non&hyphen;government senators to support my amendments and avoid making the tax legislation more unworkable and convoluted. If you <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5718"> do not, I think it is possible that this legislation will prove difficult or impossible to administer. Certainly, no&hyphen;one who supports the government legislation in its current form can claim to be a friend of tax simplification.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have tried to preserve and honour the intent of the government in my amendment. At the same time, I think the particular methods of implementing this intent have far more to do with political appearance than sensible or well&hyphen;constructed legislation. Yes, it is possible to make these changes through the rates act, just as it is possible to build a house cantilevered over a chasm on an earthquake fault line. The question remains: why do you want to do this when there are easier and more reliable options? If the government insists on pushing ahead, if the Senate insists on allowing it to do so, and if my fears are realised and government has to come back here to fix this up, I can only say that it will be on your head.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think the government intended that at all. It just happens that the Treasury has sorted it out that way and has given the government the bill.

<PARA>I have pointed out some of the ideology inherent in this bill. A particular verbal manifestation of that ideology is the insistence on the term `breadwinner'. This is not a technical term. It is not a term used anywhere else in legislation. It is slang. It is a folksy, emotive term designed to create certain images, primarily of a nostalgic interpretation of the image of a family during the Menzies era. Perhaps it is on a par with the term `homemaker' as occupation. You cannot turn back the clock.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the term is inappropriate, particularly in legislation. Today most families are dual income out of necessity. Both partners frequently contribute more equally to the family income. Many people cannot find full&hyphen;time work, and dual income families dependent on part&hyphen;time and/or casual employment are common and increasing in number.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The idea of `breadwinner' with all it invokes is inappropriate for many family structures. It is used here because this government is seeking to actively promote a certain structure for families, to try to impose what it sees as the traditional past on the moving frame of the present. Such imagery may have appeal for those who are 40 or older&mdash;gosh, that is me&mdash;but I think that will seem foreign to today's families with young children and adults in their early 20s. I remind senators that this is the most likely group to have children under five. This term is already probably terminally dated.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is inappropriate to use slang terms in legislation to push ideological images of picket fences, mum in the kitchen and dad in the Holden coming home from work.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is one of the most unconvincing performances that I have ever heard from a minister in this chamber.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the points that have been made in a serious vein by Senator Margetts and Senator Kernot about this being a 1950s term are quite valid. This is 1950s terminology.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that the language Senator Margetts proposes is more appropriate language for the 1990s. Given the nature of your comments, Senator Kemp, I think you would need to have a more substantive case than to just argue that this amendment not be carried because it is language that has run its course. If you can mount a case&mdash;seriously&mdash;that there are some significant or substantial consequential problems that would result from the passage of this amendment, then the opposition would give them due consideration and weight.

<PARA>This amendment seeks to eliminate terminology that creates gender bias within legislation. Section 4 is an entire section of several pages stipulating exactly what constitutes a member of a couple. Subsection (3) stipulates things to consider in assessing whether a couple is in a relationship. It stipulates things such as the financial aspects of the relationship, including any joint ownership of real estate or <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> other major assets and any joint liabilities, and any significant pooling of financial resources, especially in relation to major financial commitments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This subsection also talks about legal obligations, the basis of sharing of day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day household expenses, the nature of the household, any joint responsibility for providing care, the living arrangements of the people, the basis on which responsibility for housework is distributed, the social aspects of the relationship, including whether the people hold themselves out as married to each other, the assessment of friends and regular associates, the basis on which the people make plans for or engage in joint social activities, any sexual relationship between the people, the nature of the people's commitment to each other, including the length of the relationship, the nature of any companionship and emotional support that the people provide to each other, whether the people consider that the relationship is likely to continue indefinitely, and whether the people see their relationship as a marriage&hyphen;like relationship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This would seem like a very detailed description of what virtually anyone would consider to be the criteria to assess whether people are a couple in a relationship. The fly in the ointment is the introduction of a totally gratuitous and arbitrary exclusion of a whole group of people. It is primarily part of a systematic exclusion and bias against that group. In subsection 2, the definition of a member of a couple includes (b)(i), which is the subparagraph that I seek to change. Subsection 4(2)(b), which defines couples in an unmarried relationship, states:</PARA>

<PARA>Section 4(2)(b)(i) states that it is impossible for members of the same sex to legally be in a relationship, in spite of fulfilling all of the criteria anyone would use to assess this. This is fundamentally and solely a clause to exclude homosexuals. At this point, I believe that many of those who do not approve of homosexuality do at least recognise that members of the same sex do have relationships and, intuitively, using the criteria contained in subsection 4(3) can see and admit that, yes, these same sex people are in a relationship and those are not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also widely accepted that legal systematic discrimination solely on the basis of gender preference is wrong. We have the opportunity to right that wrong. We could here and now eliminate a bit of that systematic discrimination. The effect of my amendment would be to change 4(2)(b)(i) to read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The person has a relationship with a person (in this paragraph called the "<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">partner</EMPHASIS> ").</PARA>
<PARA>It is very simple. There is a clause here which is nothing but a statement of systematic refusal to extend recognition to people because they love people of their own gender. We can eliminate that discrimination. I invite your support.</PARA></SPEECH>

That circumstance itself is a token of the particular esteem in which the office of the Presidency of the United States of America is held by the Australian people, and it is also a markedly special relationship that exists between our two countries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Mr President, when the six colonies of Australia federated in 1901 to form the Commonwealth of Australia, we adopted a Westminster system of parliamentary government. But we borrowed extensively from the United States of America in relation to our other constitutional forms. We named our lower house the House of Representatives and our upper house the Senate, after the pattern of your country. We decided to assign specific powers to the central government with the residue to the state governments, after the pattern of your country. We borrowed heavily on your federal experience. The history of Australia from the parliamentary point of view has been that mixture. But out of that amalgam of British and American tracts has emerged a distinctive and characteristic Australian parliamentary democracy. It has been an echo of the aspirations of the Australian people over the long years since Federation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> There are only a very small number of countries which have continuously been democratic through the 20th century. The United States of America and Australia are two of that small and very select number of nations. For that reason, above many other reasons, your presence here today is warmly received, warmly welcomed and warmly applauded by all of the Australian people, irrespective of their political beliefs. It is rare indeed that we have an assembly of all members and senators across the party divide unanimously to welcome the leader of a great nation, a nation which has led the cause of freedom and the battle for freedom and the values we all share in common over such a long period of time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5728">  We both belong to a robust democratic tradition.

I should say that there are more than simply the government and opposition represented here. There are a number of Independent members and also members of two other political parties, the Greens and the Australian Democrats. This is a great gathering of all Australian opinion to hear you in this place, and no better forum than this.</PARA></TALK.START>

It is a place of which we are enormously proud and is a great symbol of our nation and the unity of our nation and the hopes and aspirations of our people. It has within it a very specific Australian design.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is of course not the first time&mdash;your visit here or the visit of your predecessor George Bush&mdash;that there has been the involvement of the United States in our parliamentary process, and I think it is useful to reflect on that. Throughout World War II we did have a number of parliamentary briefings given by General Douglas MacArthur, who is a man whose name rings in the halls of fame of this nation and a name that is remembered with gratitude. This brings to mind the fact that we ought to in this place appreciate through yourself the role of your nation over the last 50 years or so of international history.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You now preside over a nation which has produced probably the most unselfish gesture that any nation has in recorded history&mdash;that is, your people have been prepared to lay themselves on the line when they could have been secure in isolation and to risk for themselves nuclear devastation on behalf of their friends. It ought not go unrecorded that we do appreciate that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should be said that that sat lightly on this country because I do not think we have ever been in recent times likely to have enemies that would cause the United States to risk that nuclear devastation in assisting us. Nevertheless, we have thought it important for ourselves to play a part in that. I have often argued, particularly when I was the Minister for Defence, that we have never been consumers of American security except in that one period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also like to point out to my American colleagues that General Douglas MacArthur had more Australian troops under his command until late 1943 than American. His great victories early in the war in New Guinea were fought substantially with Australian troops. He set that matter at rest and changed the ratios in the Philippines. But, until that point in time, there had been a very substantial contribution. We have made our contribution over those years, too.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We very much appreciate the remarks I heard you make in your press conference&mdash;that you had praise for the Australian government and successive Australian governments for the role they now wish to play in removing from the American people and the world that terrible obligation. Your praise for the role of our government recently in the comprehensive test ban arrangement was very welcome on all sides of politics here, as is your commitment to ensuring that your people and the world generally have that horror removed from them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5729"> You have been a man who has exercised leadership in this region&mdash;whose leadership we all count on. You go from here with our Prime Minister to APEC&mdash;a forum the leadership component of which you had so much to do with in initiating. That forum is now broadening its wings from simply a consider ation of economic matters, critical as those are, to broader regional considerations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have always sought American engagement in this region. We have never always agreed with you on the things that you have chosen to do in that time, but we have always sought it because we have always believed that at the end of the day the values we share are the same. Those values are decent human values. Those values are egalitarian values that recognise the rights of all people of all backgrounds. Those values are values which at the end of the day ensure world peace and ensure decent living standards. So it is a privilege for me to stand here today on behalf my party to welcome you.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Well, my friends, two centuries later, our friendship, tested in war and seasoned in peace, has also become well cured. Our people have built bridges of commerce and culture, friendship and trust, reaching over the greatest expanse of ocean on earth. The United States is proud to be Australia's largest foreign investor and largest trading partner. We are also proud of the wars we have fought together and the peace we have fought to sustain together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The great diversity of our ties was born of shared experience and common values. Our pioneers both settled vast frontiers and built free nations across entire continents. In one another, I really believe we see a distant mirror of our better selves: reflections of liberty and decency, of openness and vitality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this century, our bonds have truly been forged in the fires of wars&mdash;war after war after war. Together we carried liberty's torch in the darkest nights of the 20th century. My message to you today is that we must embrace the dawn of this new century together and we must make the most of it together. We carried a torch through the night; now we can create the dawn our children deserve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For Australia's strength and sacrifice through these many struggles, for your fierce love of liberty and your unfailing friendship to the United States, the American people thank you. And the American people look forward with you to this new era of freedom and possibilities. After all, our nations are at peace; our economies are strong; the ideas we have struggled for&mdash;freedom of religion, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5730"> speech and assembly, open markets, tolerance&mdash;are more and more the habits of all humanity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the first time in all history, two&hyphen;thirds of all the nations on this earth and more than half the people alive today are ruled by governments picked by their own people. The rigid blocks and barriers that too long defined the world are giving way to an era of breath&hyphen;taking expansion of information technology and information. And because of these things we now have a chance, greater than any generation of people who ever lived before us, to give more and more people the opportunity to realise their God&hyphen;given potential to live their own dreams, not someone else's plan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But this chance we have is nothing more than that. It is a chance, not a guarantee. For all its promise, we know that this new century will not be free of peril and therefore we know that our freedom still requires our responsibility. Nations and peoples still will be tempted to fight wars for territory or out of ethnic, religious or racial hatred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I told the American people over and over again during the recent election campaign, it was literally heartbreaking to me to think of how much of their time I had to spend dealing with people who still believe it is all right to murder each other and each other's children because of their racial, their religious, their ethnic, their tribal differences. We must stand against that, and the example of how we live together must be a rebuke to that in the 21st century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Make no mistake about it, there is a nexus of new threats&mdash;terrorists, rogue states, international criminals, drug traffickers. They too menace our security, and they will do more of it in the new century. They will be all the more lethal if they gain access to weapons of mass destruction, whether nuclear, chemical or biological.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Because of our size, our strength, our prosperity and the power of our example, Australia and the United States have a special responsibility not only to seize the opportunities but to move against the new threats of the 21st century. Together we can reduce even more the danger of weapons of mass destruc tion. We can take the fight to the terrorists and the drug traffickers; we can extend the reach of free and fair trade; we can advance democracy around the world; and, yes, we can prove that free societies can embrace the economic and social changes and the ethnic, racial and religious diversity this new era brings and come out stronger and freer than ever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The threat of nuclear weapons born a half century ago finally is diminishing as a new century begins. The United States and Russia are reducing our arsenals, pointing our weapons away from one another and working to safeguard nuclear materials and facilities. Every single Australian should be very proud of the role your country has played in guiding the world toward a more secure future. You helped lead the fight to extend the non-proliferation treaty. Your determined diplomacy brought the comprehensive test ban treaty to reality and the world to the verge of banning all nuclear testing for all time. Every nation is in your debt for that achievement. On behalf again of the people of the United States, I say thank you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now we must pursue together our remaining arms control agenda for the reductions in Russia's and America's arsenals, once Russia ratifies START II: a chemical weapons convention, so that our troops never face poison gas on the battlefield and our people never fall victim to it in a terrorist attack; a stronger biological weapons convention, so that disease is never used as a weapon of war; and a worldwide ban on landmines, so that all our children can walk with confidence on the earth beneath them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we deal with these challenges to our security, we must recognise the new ones which are emerging and the new approaches they require. Terrorism, international crime and drug trafficking are forces of destruction that have no tolerance for national borders. Together we must show zero tolerance for them. That means putting pressure on rogue states, not doing business with them. It is very difficult to do business by day with people who kill innocent civilians by night.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It means giving no aid and quarter to terrorists who slaughter the innocent and drug <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5731"> traffickers who poison our children. It means, in short, pursuing a concerted strategy&mdash;intelligence and police cooperation worldwide, coordinated legal action in every country to stop money laundering, shutting down grey markets for guns and false documents, and increasing extraditions. It means security coordination in our airports and airplanes, and giving, each in our own nations, our law enforcement officials the tools they need to cooperate and to succeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The measure of our people's security includes not only their physical safety, however, but, as we all know, their economic well-being. Our two countries have led in opening markets around the world and we can be pleased with our progress. Through GATT, the WTO, APEC and literally hundreds of smaller accords, we are moving to extend the reach of free and fair trade. But we can do more, issue by issue, agreement by agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am determined to work with Congress in my second term to move ahead boldly on market opening initiatives around the world. Decades from now I want people to say that our generation rose to the challenge of creating a new open trading system for the 21st century. If we do, more people will have good jobs and better lives as they share in humanity's genius for progress.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the long term we can best advance the security and prosperity we seek by expanding and strengthening not only trade but the community of free nations. The tide of democracy is now running strong and deep. Consider this: in just the past few weeks, the people of Lithuania, Bulgaria, Romania, Moldova, Nicaragua and Thailand have freely elected their leaders&mdash;a prospect literally unimaginable not very long ago. In my own hemisphere every nation but one has raised freedom's flag. In central Europe and in Russia, Ukraine and the other new independent states, the forces of reform have earned our respect and deserve our continued support. For the first time since the rise of nation states on the continent of Europe it is literally conceivable that we have an opportunity&mdash;a real and tangible opportunity&mdash;to build a continent that is democratic, undivided and at <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> peace. It has never been possible before, and together we can achieve it now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that some people on both sides of the Pacific are concerned that America's continuing involvement with Europe and our intense renewed involvement with our neighbours in Latin America will lead to disengagement from the Asia-Pacific region. They are wrong. Mr Prime Minister, if I could borrow your eloquent phrase&mdash;at least I am giving you credit, which we politicians do not often do&mdash;the United States does not need to choose between our history and our geography. We need not choose between Europe and Asia. In a global economy with global security challenges, America must look to the east no less than to the west. Our security demands it. After all, we fought three wars here in living memory. The Cold War's last frontier lies now on the Korean peninsula. The region as a whole is in the midst of profound change&mdash;so our security demands it; our prosperity requires it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One-third of our exports and more than two million American jobs depend upon our trade with Asia. Over the next decade, Asia's remarkable growth will mean ever expanding markets for those who can compete in them. Our future cannot be secure if Asia's future is in doubt. As we enter the 21st century, therefore I say to you that not only has America been but she is and will remain a Pacific power. We want America's involvement and influence to provide the stability among nations which is necessary for the people of the Asia-Pacific region to make the routines of normal life a reality and to spur the economic progress that will benefit all of us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To meet those challenges of stability we are now pursuing three objectives: stronger alliances, deeper engagement with China and a larger community of democracies. First, we share the view of almost every nation in Asia that a strong American security presence remains the bedrock for regional stability. We will maintain about 100,000 troops across the Pacific, just as we maintain about 100,000 troops in Europe. We will keep them well trained, well equipped and well prepared. We <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5732"> will continue to revitalise our core alliances, both bilaterally and regionally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These efforts, let me say clearly, are not directed against any nation. They are intended to advance security and stability for everyone so that we can grow together and work together, all of us, in the new century. Our alliance with the democratic, prosperous Japan has been one of the great achievements of the postwar period. Last spring, after more than a year's hard study and work, Prime Minister Hashimoto and I signed a new security charter. Japan's continued support for our military presence and even closer links between our armed forces will enable us to deepen our cooperation on behalf of peace and stability in this region and beyond.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With our close ally in South Korea we are working to reduce tensions on the Korean peninsula that threaten all of North-East Asia. We must give new momentum now to the four&hyphen;party peace talks President Kim and I proposed last spring, and we must continue our work to dismantle North Korea's frozen nuclear program. We are reinforcing our security ties with the Philippines and Thailand while multiplying the power of our troops through greater access to regional military facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, and simply put, the defence links between the United States and Australia have never been stronger in peacetime. Mr Prime Minister and members of parliament, the agreements our foreign and defence ministers signed this summer in Sydney authorised the largest exercises involving our troops since World War II. American marines will soon begin training in northern Australia, and we are deepening our already strong security cooperation. Today I say again with utter confidence: our alliance is not just for this time; it is for all time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we work nation to nation let us continue to build a new architecture for regional security as well&mdash;an architecture through ASEAN that will strengthen our ability to confront common challenges. Already this effort is helping to defuse tensions in the South China Sea and to dispel distrust across the region. We must pursue it to its full potential.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our second stabilising objective is deeper engagement with China. The direction China takes in years to come, the way it defines its greatness in the future, will help to decide whether the next century is one of conflict or cooperation. The emergence of a stable, open and prosperous China, a strong China confident of its place in the world and willing to assume its responsibilities as a great nation, is in our deepest interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">True cooperation is both possible and plainly productive. We worked closely with China to extend the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and to secure the passage of the comprehensive test ban treaty. We joined to shore up peace in Cambodia and increase stability on the Korean peninsula. We are making progress together on some tough issues, from nuclear technology to intellectual property rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The United States and China will continue to have important differences, especially in the area of human rights, and we will continue to discuss them candidly. But, by working together where possible and dealing with our differences openly and respectfully where necessary, we can deepen our dialogue and add to Asia's stability. I look forward to doing just that when I meet for the fourth time with President Jung in the Philippines next week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third part of our work for stability is support for the advance of democracy. Our two nations know that democracy comes in many forms. Neither of us seeks to impose our own vision on others, but we also share the conviction that some basic rights are universal and we have to decide whether we believe that. I believe that everywhere people aspire to be treated with dignity, to give voice to their opinions, to choose their own leaders. We have seen these dreams realised in the democratic odyssey of the Asia-Pacific, from Japan to South Korea, to Thailand and Mongolia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this century we have sacrificed many of our sons and daughters, your nation and ours, for the cause of freedom, and so we must continue to speak for the cause of freedom in this new age of commerce and trade and technology. We must push repressive regimes <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5733"> in places like Burma to pursue reconciliation in genuine political dialogue. We must assist new democracies like Cambodia by encouraging the development of political parties and institutions. We know that the freer and better educated people are, the more creative they become, the better able they are to compete, the more able they are to satisfy each other's deepest wants and needs. We can look at the economic vitality of the Philippines, Thailand, Taiwan and South Korea to see the proof of this assertion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As stability extends its reach and strengthens its grip, the Pacific may finally be able to live up to its name. In Cambodia farmers once again till the land that had become horrific killing fields. In Vietnam school children can worry more about their exams than about the war. From Bangkok to Manila, power is no longer used against the people; it is in the hands of the people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A generation ago it was hard to imagine how rapidly freedom could come to these nations, how rapidly their economies could grow. But freed from the threat of war, unleashed by their new-found freedoms, the people of this region have built among the greatest success stories the world has ever seen. They have transformed economic wastelands into powerful engines for growth; enriched the lives of millions by harnessing the technology of change. Today the economies of the Asia-Pacific are clearly the most dynamic on earth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> More than seven million Americans trace their roots to Asia. Five of our states touch the Pacific. We are inexorably linked to the promise of the Asia-Pacific region. That is why in the first year of my term I sought to elevate the APEC forum that began right here in Canberra into the first ever meeting of Asia and Pacific leaders. At our inaugural summit in Seattle, working closely with your former Prime Minister Paul Keating, we agreed to give this extraordinarily diverse region a common goal: to work as a community of nations committed to economic integration. A year later in Jakarta we made a historic commitment: free trade and investment in the region by 2020. Some said that was an illusory vision, but already that vision is becom ing a blueprint&mdash;a blueprint taking shape as concrete commitments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At next week's leaders meeting, Prime Minister Howard and I hope and expect that APEC will give a boost to specific market opening initiatives. For me, I hope that means unshackling trade in computers, semiconductors and telecommunications&mdash;the high-tech sectors of the future. We have an opportunity to set an example for the rest of the world, and we ought to seize it. If we do, the nations of the region will benefit&mdash;those who provide the services and those who receive them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Progress, after all, is not yet everyone's partner, and we have a responsibility to open the doors of opportunity to those who remain outside the global economy. For example, some two-thirds of the people on our planet have no access to a telephone. I found that hard to believe when I saw so many of your fellow citizens with their cellphones in their hands as I drove up and down your streets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More than half the people of the world are two days walk from a telephone. They are totally disconnected from the communications and information revolution that is the present vehicle for human progress and possibility. If we add their creative energies to the mix which now exists, of course they will gain skills and jobs and greater wealth, but we also will benefit from the higher growth rates, from the expanded markets and from the increasing likelihood that those people will find peaceful rather than war-like ways to release their energies. We can do this if we have the courage not to retreat but instead to compete.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At this year's meeting at APEC, and everywhere I go, I will also deliver again a simple, loud and clear message: the United States is more determined than ever to create an Asian</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5734">
<PARA>Pacific community of shared efforts, shared benefits and shared destiny. The interests that compel our engagement have grown, not shrunk, and so has our commitment to a Pacific future. We know from our past that we can succeed, that we are equal to the difficulties ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I began the day by quoting Prime Minister Menzies, so let me conclude by returning to his words. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The world needs every scrap of democratic strength that can be found in it because nobody, however optimistic, need underestimate the measure or the character of danger that always confronts us. It is not merely our privilege to be strong, it is our duty to be strong.</PARA>
<PARA>The world needs Australia. The world needs the United States. It needs us together as partners and friends and allies. We have stood together in the hard times as partners and friends. Let us stand together and work together now for a new future of peace and possibility that extends to our children and our grandchildren and to all the children of the world.</PARA>
