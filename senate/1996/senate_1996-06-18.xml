<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to Senator Short, the Assistant Treasurer. Minister, are you aware of the requirements of section 130B of the Sales Tax Assessment Act? Are you aware that that section requires that `where a minister makes a public statement which announces that it is the intention of the government to introduce into a house of the parliament a bill relating to a sales tax law to operate from a date before the enactment of the bill, the commissioner must, within seven days of that minister making the statement, publish, for the information of taxpayers in each state and territory, a public notice, in plain English, in at least two newspapers circulating generally in that state or territory'?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So far as the requirements of the tax act for the publication of sales tax or other tax change measures are concerned, they are ones of course that the government always has fully in mind. We will continue to do so. If you are referring to the Treasurer's announcement last week on 11 June relating to sales tax, that was an announcement in relation to the Premiers Conference that was forthcoming. It was a matter for discussion and consideration within the context of the Premiers Conference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think you will find that has been done on numerous other occasions, and presumably it will continue to be done as is necessary in the future. But, so far as the requirements from the taxation commissioner are concerned, the fact is the Treasurer has announced that the necessary arrangements and announcements to put into effect legislatively the decisions that were finalised only last Friday will be done at the appropriate time.</PARA></ANSWER>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to Senator Hill, the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Minister, most Australians are well aware of the benefits to Australia in general terms of investment in this country but could you explain the vital importance of major capital investment in Australia's natural heritage? Have you noticed any growing support for the government's proposals in this area?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="1677" SPEAKER="Hill, Sen Robert" NAMEID="BH4" ELECTORATE="SA" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Environment" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will deal with the second part of the question first. It is in fact pleasing to see more organisations coming out in support of the government's plan. That is not surprising because of the obvious merit. No doubt all honourable senators, in reading last weekend's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> , would have noticed that the world's largest coastal environment group, the Surfrider Foundation, `demanded yesterday that Telstra be sold for the sake of the nation's environment'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Very interestingly, the announcement was made by Mr Brad Farmer, head of the Australian arm of Surfrider and a former adviser to the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Cheryl Kernot. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For 18 years they (the Democrats) have been asking exactly, virtually to a T, what the Liberal Government is offering, and to decline it on these grounds is less than honest, I think.</PARA>
<PARA>That is true because for so long the Democrats and the Greens have called for a greater investment in the natural heritage of Australia, and now they have the opportunity to support it of course they intend to block it. It was also interesting to note that the Environment Management Industry Association of Australia came out in support of our natural heritage bill, to be introduced into the parliament tomorrow. Dr Cole of that organisation said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Money, not good intentions and high sounding rhetoric, is what is required to protect and improve our environmental resource.</PARA>
<PARA>That says exactly what the situation is. The former government, the Labor Party, no doubt would have liked to have done more in this area as well because everyone recognises the need to re-invest in our natural environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind the Senate that over five million hectares of native vegetation were cleared within only 10 years between 1983 and 1993. I could remind the Senate also of those animals and birds that have become extinct, those mammals and plant species that are currently declining. I could talk about the state of our rivers, our seas, our coast. Everyone recognises that what is now necessary is a major capital investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This parliament has before it the opportunity to endorse the government's process and re-invest $1 billion in this program. Mr President, I remind you what will come out of that investment. Some $318 million over five years would be invested in a national vegetation initiative both to retard further clearing and to fund a very major revegetation program. About $32 million would be invested in a land and water resource audit. Some $163 million would be used for the Murray-Darling project; $85 million would be for the national river care initiative to pick up other rivers that are not covered by the Murray&hyphen;Darling initiative; and $100 million would be for the coast and clean seas initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Everyone accepts that the time has come for us to pause and recognise the situation, and to reinvest a large capital sum in the natural environment. In so many ways it has been overworked, in so many ways it has been damaged&mdash;partly out of ignorance&mdash;and it can be rectified only by a large capital injection of funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have the process to do that; we have the way to do it. All we need is for the Labor Party and the other minority parties to come on board and to recognise that this is an opportunity too good to miss, and to join with us in making this very major investment in Australia's natural heritage.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to Senator Short, the Assistant Treasurer. Minister, yesterday in this place you said, in answer to a question from Senator Chris Evans:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You wrecked an economy . . . You left us well below achieving the growth potential of this nation.</PARA>
<PARA>Minister, how do you reconcile these remarks with those of the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, who recently said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian economy continues by world standards to enjoy very strong growth and, in common with most of the OECD countries, we have lower levels of inflation and we continue to enjoy the benefits.</PARA>
<PARA>Minister, will you undertake to point out to the Prime Minister where he was wrong?</PARA></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="1678" SPEAKER="Short, Sen Jim" NAMEID="DJ4" ELECTORATE="VIC" PARTY="LP" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister was not wrong. The fact is that the Australian economy is growing robustly at the moment. We welcome that&mdash;we always have welcomed that. We have said, though, that the Australian economy could have been doing a darn sight better over recent years had it had some responsible economic management, which was disastrously lacking when Labor was in office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Look at a few comparisons in the context of the economy growing robustly at the moment. When Labor came to office in 1983, the foreign debt of this country was $23 billion. Today it is $180 billion plus. In the last four years alone, Commonwealth debt has increased despite the fact that the economy has been growing. It has increased fivefold to $84 billion from a figure just four years ago of $16 billion. Indeed, total Commonwealth debt today is a massive $93 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the last three to four years, including the projection for next year, the accumulated bottom line deficit of Labor governments will total a monstrous $40 billion. That is the reason why interest rates are far higher than they should be. That is the reason why unemployment is so much higher than it should be. That is the reason why, compared with our major competitor nations around the world, particularly those in South&hyphen;East Asia, we are doing badly.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of those things are solvable. They should never have happened in the first place. They were due to the mismanagement of the former government and that is precisely the reason why, to use the words of your former Treasurer, Ralph Willis, just two to three weeks ago, `Labor lost the trust of the Australian people'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You lost the trust of the Australian people because under your regime you squandered the great opportunities for growth and development that this country has. The mandate for the present government, which we have set out in a very active and vigorous way to fulfil, is to restore hope, confidence, opportunity and growth to the Australian people and the Australian economy.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yet again, Senator Short, you have failed to answer the question. Have you read the Prime Minister's comments? Do you agree with them? Why do you continue to contradict the Prime Minister on the excellent economic growth of Australia?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no contradiction at all between my comments and the Prime Minister's. As I said, the Prime Minister is totally correct in saying that the Australian economy is in a robust situation. The point I am making is that for the last 10 years, particularly the last four years of economic growth, the then Labor government squandered the enormous opportunities it had to put Australia onto a really sustainable, long&hyphen;term growth path. That is what we are on about totally.</PARA></TALK.START></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to Senator Richard Alston, the Minister for Communications and the Arts.

I quote:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So let Senator Alston come in here and quote from something else other than British Telecom's figures, because what we need to point out is that reliance on one source like that forms a very small part of the story. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1679"> </PARA>
<PARA>Minister, I am sure you can rise to the challenge, and I ask you to provide Senator Kernot and the Senate with third party evidence that shows that British consumers have benefited from a 40 per cent price reduction since the privatisation in 1984.</PARA></QUESTION>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No doubt when she does return she will be able to absorb some of the information that I think is critically missing from the current debate. I have to confess that I have not yet heard from Fidel. I presume that his fax has not got through because of congestion on the line or because he cannot afford the high prices that are charged in Australia for international access.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What Senator Kernot challenged me to a month or two back&mdash;on 29 May, in fact&mdash;was to come into this chamber with some independent figures. In other words, she did not accept the validity of the BT figures which I tabled in this chamber. She, I think, was asking for some third party verification.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that Oftel, which is the regulator upon which Austel in this country is based, has recently released a paper called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Pricing of Telecommunications Services from 1997</EMPHASIS>. This gives a history of what has occurred in the United Kingdom following privatisation. Senator Kernot seems to be under the impression that price caps were only introduced into the UK in 1993. The fact is that they have had price caps there since 1984, and changes to that price capping regime in 1993 were pretty much in line with the changes that have occurred in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Oftel reports that, since the first price cap in 1984, BT's prices have fallen on average by 40 per cent in real terms, while BT's efficiency has increased overall by an average of 3.5 per cent a year in real terms. They also say quality of service has improved significantly both in terms of network quality through substantial investment and new <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> technology in customer service, and BT has continued to earn an adequate return on capital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They also say that for prices across all areas, from local calls at peak time to off-peak to national and international rates, the reductions on average have been about 40 per cent. They outline significant reductions in residential line rentals and business line rentals. Indeed, the prices have only increased by about half the inflation rate. Meanwhile, connection charges have fallen in real terms for residential consumers by 6.3 per cent and for businesses by 36.9 per cent. Local calls have fallen by 47.3 per cent, and standard call charges have fallen by 35.7 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I could go on and on, but the fact remains that there is some very good news coming out of the UK. It is very disappointing that Senator Kernot seems to want to be the Hanrahan of the Senate and pretend that somehow we will all be `rooned' if we do what the rest of the world is doing. There is no-one left. Once Albania went, I would have thought the game was up. With South Africa now prepared to speed up the privatisation process, there really is not anyone left in this game who wants to run this sort of line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why I think it is very important to understand why the Democrats are doing it. Do they argue that, if the UK had not privatised, you would have had even more substantial reductions in prices and increases in quality of service, or do they seriously contest the proposition, as every other independent observer would contend, that it is the combination of all these things that makes the difference? Unless you have privatisation accompanying the rest, you will not get anything like the benefits they have derived in the UK.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is about the only difference. We have got price caps; they have got price caps. They have got competition; we have got competition. In fact, we go further with untimed local calls and the consumer safeguards regime, and yet we are very much off the world pace&mdash;about 30 per cent, according to Telstra's own assessments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why is it that we are lagging the rest of the world and BT has been able to outperform, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1680"> and British consumers have been able to reap a bonanza? The answer is that it is a combination of all these things. If privatisation was a real hindrance in that process, then, of course, they would be much better off, and I doubt that even the Democrats would argue that. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

I am sure the minister is aware of the continuing and, in fact, worsening human rights situation in Burma, and the fact that the SLORC has placed further restrictions on pro-democracy <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and her supporters from engaging in political meetings and gatherings.

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable senator for her question and her continuing interest in Burma's human rights issues&mdash;as I do, Mr President, your interest and Senator Reid's and, once upon a time, Senator Schacht's.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of us who have protested the loss of democracy, one at the ballot box and the other lost at the point of a gun&mdash;the continuing situation of political prisoners' labour circumstances that cannot be characterised other than as forced labour&mdash;remain disturbed and disappointed that so little progress has been made to improve the human rights situation in Burma.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think, Senator Bourne, from time to time we see some modest signs of hope&mdash;only to see them so quickly dashed. In the lead&hyphen;up to the recent convention of the National League for Democracy, there were many arrests, which caused great international concern as well as concern within Burma. Nevertheless, the convention was able to go ahead, and we thought perhaps that was a positive sign for the future. Then there were some signs that the detainees were starting to be released, and we thought that was perhaps a modest positive sign for the future. But then we had our hopes dashed by, as you say, a further clampdown: the proclamation of a law that provides for draconian penalties of up to 20 years imprisonment for individuals and suspension or abolition of organisations expressing political dissent that can be characterised as undermining peace or stability. Therefore, the chances of further conventions, such as the one that was allowed to take place, are very unlikely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As you know, Senator Bourne, the international community has wrestled for a long time as to what is the best mix of policies to try to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1681"> influence change for the better in Burma. Whether they have been the ASEAN type policies of engagement or whether they have been policies more akin to that of Australia&mdash;and the United States, in particular, in many ways has led the alternative of providing limitations upon trade or other contact&mdash;neither formula, unfortunately, has produced the results that we would like to see. Certainly the new Australian government will maintain the embargo on the export of defence and defence related goods to Burma.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue of whether Burma enters ASEAN remains, we believe, an issue for ASEAN to determine. As I said a moment ago, ASEAN, in trying to influence a better outcome in these matters, has sought to adopt a somewhat different approach. Our intention is to very much continue with the policies that this country has now pursued for some time of setting benchmarks and, when we can see positive signs of progress, of giving some reward and encouragement to those positive signs. We certainly do not want to get ahead of the game and give encouragement that would suggest that the international community is going to accept the legitimacy of Burma's regime whilst it continues to oppress its people in the way that it currently does.</PARA></ANSWER>

I certainly wonder whether any restraints on trade, even if they are only in terms of expressed sentiment, are really going to make much difference.

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FF4">Senator CHAPMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Assistant Treasurer. Is it true that the former Labor government left the Australian people a legacy of ballooning public debt and that Labor had a 13&hyphen;year window of opportunity to do something constructive on public debt but chose to do nothing about it? What will be the benefit for the average Australian of the reduction in public debt resulting from all Australians being given the opportunity to purchase, and directly own, part of Telstra?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Chapman for his question. The answer, of course, to the first part of his question is an unequivocal yes. The former government did leave a legacy of ballooning debt to the Australian people and, of course, to future generations of Australians. That question from Senator Chapman really goes to the whole heart of what the government with its debt reduction strategy is all about. What it is all about is trying to repair the huge damage to the structure of the government's finances that occurred under the 13 years of Labor and to get the government's books back into the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1682"> black. The legacy of Labor's debt to the Australian people is arguably one of the greatest legacies that any political party in government has left to the people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last four years alone, as I said in response to an earlier question, despite the fact that there was growth in the economy and despite the fact that the government should have been in surplus rather than in deficit, the Labor government racked up deficit after deficit after deficit. The net result is that over the last four years the total of Commonwealth general government debt increased almost fivefold from more than $16 billion to almost $84 billion, and total Commonwealth debt blew out to a monstrous figure of $93 billion.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to thank Senator O'Chee for that question. The genesis of this stupid and unnecessary strike is a decision by the Queensland Industrial Relations Commission to give coverage of the Dalrymple Bay coal terminal to the AWU rather than the CFMEU. Rather than accept the umpire's decisions, the CFMEU is thumbing its nose at the court and putting a deadline on the users of the port to support the CFMEU or accept the industrial consequences&mdash;typical blackmail that we have been used to in the past.

It is true that the International Whaling Commission will meet in Aberdeen next week and the government has instructed its delegation to pursue positions that are consistent with our policy statement; that is, the objective of the implementation of a permanent international ban on commercial whaling.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are proud, as the coalition, that it was the Fraser government which led the way in pushing for an international ban on commercial whaling, and we intend to pursue that same policy with vigour now that we are back in government. This is set to a disturbing background, which was touched upon in the question of Senator Crane; that is, Norway has recently doubled its kill of minke whales <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1687"> and Japan's so-called scientific take is now up to some 540 minke whales. To that background, we have instructed our delegation not to vote in support of the proposed revised management procedures. Although it might be argued that those procedures will provide for the taking of whales at a lesser rate than perhaps some other formulas, nevertheless we believe that to enter into that debate could in fact be inconsistent with the ultimate objective that we are seeking; that is, the permanent international ban. We have instructed our delegation accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also instructed the delegation to vote in support of a ban on the electric lance method of killing whales. We will be voting in that instance together with Britain and New Zealand. We have instructed the delegation to oppose any proposal for an aboriginal take of whales not based on clearly demonstrated evidence of subsistence need. In that instance, in particular, we are concerned by a US proposal for the Makah Indian tribe to be allowed a take of grey whales, some five whales, for so-called cultural reasons. In that instance the claim is not even being made that it is for subsistence need, and this particular tribe, the Makah Indians, have not taken whales for some 70 years. So we believe that would be a significant step in the wrong direction, and we have instructed our delegation to indicate that through our vote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have further asked our delegation to call on Norway to abandon its annual minke whale hunt; to express the government's strong opposition to Japan's `scientific take' of whales; to reaffirm the government's support of the southern ocean whale sanctuary established under the IWC; and to continue to promote non&hyphen;lethal research into whales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that, by pursuing the positions I have just outlined, we will be sending a clear signal to the international community that this new Australian government is serious about seeking, and moving towards, the implementation of a permanent international ban on commercial whaling, which is long overdue.  </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate, the Minister for the Environment. My question concerns Coode Island which, for those people who live outside Victoria, is an island very close to the centre of Melbourne where dangerous chemicals are stored. It was the scene some years ago of a fire. Is the federal government going to help the Victorian government to reallocate the chemical complex that is on Coode Island to some other place?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Cooney no doubt knows the history of this matter which was, as I understand, that after a fire  some five years ago it was decided that the chemical storage complex in suburban Melbourne was inappropriately located and should therefore be moved. In the first instance I think it was suggested that it should move to Point Wilson. The former Australian government, the Labor government, decided that Point Wilson might be better used for an armaments depot. Then the suggestion was put that it should move to Point Lillias. That has been under consideration for some time. There has been an environmental impact process taking place by the Victorian authorities and endorsed by the Commonwealth. It was designated by the Commonwealth under the EPIP act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two major concerns of the Commonwealth. The first is that it is likely to impact upon the correct Ramsar listed wetland. As you know, there have been very few instances in which wetland boundaries have been changed. The second concern of the Commonwealth, which was put to the environmental process by ANCA, both in writing and orally, was the problem of the endangered species the orange&hyphen;bellied parrot, which uses this land space during the winter. As I understand it, it breeds in the wilderness areas of the south&hyphen;west of Tasmania and then, as the temperature declines in Tasmania, moves to the southern mainland states, in particular, Victoria and this area. There are very few pairs of this parrot left in existence today. Therefore we have very serious concerns as to its wellbeing.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1688">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That environmental assessment process is nearing a completion. The Victorian government has not made a decision upon it. We continue to express to it our concerns about both those issues, the wetlands in general and the orange&hyphen; bellied parrot. I hope that we will endeavour to see whether there is a formula that could allow both objectives.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to Senator Herron, Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. Given the legacy of 13 years of neglect and mismanagement of Aboriginal programs by the Hawke&hyphen;Keating Labor governments, what is the Howard coalition government doing to ensure that steps are being taken to improve accountability within Aboriginal organisations?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="1688" SPEAKER="Herron, Sen John" NAMEID="VW4" ELECTORATE="QLD" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VW4">Senator HERRON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Panizza for the question. After 13 years of Labor neglect, conditions in Aboriginal communities have not improved. Funding has not been getting through to indigenous people, and successive Labor governments have chosen to ignore the fact&mdash;just as they are today in opposition. As a result, health standards and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> infrastructure in many indigenous communities are a disgrace.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Infant mortality in the Aboriginal population is two to three times that of non&hyphen;Aboriginal children. Life expectancy is 16 to 19 years shorter than for the rest of the population. Approximately 14,000 dwellings are still required to meet housing needs in urban, rural and remote locations. In October last year, 120 remote Aboriginal communities did not have adequate water supply systems; 134 communities lacked appropriate sewage disposal systems; and 250 communities had no electricity. After 13 years, that is the record of the Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many indigenous people are living in Third World conditions because the previous government failed to make sure that funding was reaching the people. I have visited a number of disadvantaged communities, as I have already mentioned, over the last three month. It is a shame that those opposite, who are the loudest in their criticism, cannot accompany me there to see them. Then they would be quiet. They would be silent and they would be ashamed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, Aboriginal legal services were in disarray, depriving many prisoners of adequate legal representation. This government will not let this condition continue. We announced recently that a special auditor would be appointed to improve accountability in Aboriginal organisations and, ultimately, outcomes for indigenous peoples. Special auditors KPMG started work last week. They will have the opportunity to look at approximately 6,000 grants to 2,000 recipient bodies. The special auditor has been appointed to enable the government to follow the money trail and ensure that funds are getting through to indigenous communities. There has obviously been a serious problem for many years, and we are taking steps to rectify the situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I mentioned previously, I visited more communities in Western Australia last week and again saw many examples of areas that have not received adequate funding. People are actually suffering. Previously, the Office of Evaluation and Audit was constrained in its ability to trace the money trail. It did not have <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1689"> the power to stop grants where there was a breach of requirements. The special auditor will be able to fill in these gaps. This is the first step in the enormous task of improving conditions for Aboriginal people.</PARA>

It said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Wholesale sales tax will apply to general purpose road vehicles provided wholly or partly for private use as part of remuneration by Commonwealth, state, territory and local governments to take effect from 11th June 1996.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth has undertaken not to proceed with the withdrawal of the WST exemption in relation to other items canvassed in its offer of 11 June and the Treasurer's associated press release.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, on 14 June the Treasurer was saying, `Here is a final agreement, reached after negotiation and consultation with the states. It is an agreement as of today&mdash;that is, Friday, 14 June&mdash;even though it were to take effect from three days earlier.' There is a huge difference between the date of effect of a measure and the date on which the statement is made. Time and again you have statements that are made in this parliament and elsewhere that will take effect from a different date. That is precisely the case in relation to this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not have section 130B of the Sales Tax Assessment Act in front of me, but as I understand from what you read, Senator Faulkner, it says&mdash;correct me if I am wrong&mdash;`within seven days of the minister making the statement' and then the necessary follow through with the press announcements and so on. The fact is that the minister made the statement in relation to the agreement that was eventually reached on Friday, 14 June. I am sure that anyone with any knowledge of the law&mdash;I do not know whether Senator Faulkner does or not, but I see Senator Cooney looking wise over there, and I would be interested to hear his view&mdash;would know that the statement can only be the statement that relates to the date on which the agreed announcement is made.

It was Prime Minister Keating who destroyed cooperative federalism at the altar of his own political ambition. We have now taken a great step forward.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have seen that the state premiers have been prepared to come together with Prime Minister Howard and Treasurer Costello to make a significant commitment on behalf of the states, including Tasmania, Senator Murphy, to ensure that future generations of Australians do not have to pay the high mortgage that you people have imposed upon them through your fiscal ineptitude.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other interesting fact is that the government has sought to overcome what has become a serious rort in the taxation system in Australia. Of course, the Commonwealth did not get everything it wanted to. The states, as I said yesterday, do not come along to Canberra and say, `Here's a few billion dollars; we want to sort out the tax system. Take all the money; we'll pay our share.' Of course they are going to fight. They have their own budgets to balance; they have their own political problems in each state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason this opposition is so nervous about sorting out the sales tax rort&mdash;the reason that particularly Senator Murphy, another former union activist, is so embarrassed about sorting out the sales tax rort&mdash;is their continued embarrassment over my uncovering a few years ago the old Transport Workers Union sales tax rort. That involved a quarter of a million dollars worth of sales tax. I first raised the issue in January 1994.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1693">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When they were in government, Labor leased luxury cars like Fairmonts&mdash;that is probably what Senator Murphy drives these days&mdash;to their mates in the Transport Workers Union. It is the same sales tax rort. This is why they are so embarrassed about it. They do not want to talk about the sales tax rorts because they leased cars to their mates in the Transport Workers Union&mdash;a tax free, quarter of a million dollar gift to your mates in the union.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here we are having to fix up the rort. The Treasurer in his statement of 14 June&mdash;for Senator Sherry, who cannot even get his calendar right&mdash;said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Wholesale sales tax will apply to general purpose road vehicles provided wholly or partly for private use as part of remuneration by Commonwealth, State, Territory and local governments to take effect from 11 June . . . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is extremely disturbing to hear anybody in the Senate suggest that words of legislation are a joke. If the implication is that it depends on who you need to inform as to whether or not the law and the words of the law need to be complied with, then that is a real problem in relation to contempt of the parliamentary and democratic process. Basically, it is not a selective law, you cannot decide whether or not you think it is a good tax. It has nothing to do with whether it is a good tax or a bad tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of us think that the way in which it was put together was probably not very wise. However, the idea is also not about who the people are who are interested in the outcomes of the tax. It is not a selective bill that says that you can choose who you inform. Section 130B of the Sales Tax Assessment Act clearly says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where a Minister makes a public statement which announces that it is the intention of the Government to introduce into a House of the Parliament a bill . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The reality is that there will always be groups in our society who will want to change the decision of a government. We do agree that the states have a greater lobbying ability, obviously, than most other groups in the community. However, in this case they acted as lobbyists. The fact that this was a meeting with an obviously very influential group of people&mdash;albeit state government lobbyists and premiers&mdash;is not sufficient to say that the announcement did not take place. The announcement did take place. The very influential lobbyists, that is, the state premiers, had a difference of opinion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is nothing in the act which indicates that it depends on whether the announcement is to be presented to an influential group of lobbyists or not. That is not in there. There is nothing in it which says anything about whether it affects people in government or in government positions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1694"> If we are to have respect for the parliamentary process, perhaps the government needs to speak to its departments and com municate. I am sure that there must have been somebody within one of the departments trying to present this concern to the minister, saying that this was the statutory requirement. If this communication did not happen, then one wonders on how many other occasions communication between departments and the minister may be so bad that the opportunity for ministers to fulfil their statutory requirements is not met.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To base a defence on whether or not a group, albeit a very influential group, agreed with this announcement is not a defence relating to this government abiding by its statutory requirements. Therefore, I rise to support what has been stated here today by the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course we rise to support it, because it was, in fact, the amendment of the Greens (WA) in the fist place. We believe that the community did have the right to know about the implications for taxation, especially such things as sales tax. A government press release is not good enough. People in the community do have the right to know. They have the right to know when a change has occurred. They do have the right to know in simple terms what the implications of this change are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even government employees have the right to know. Of course, the implications of these changes not only affect government employees but also the revenue and services provided to all states and territories in Australia. That has become quite clear. The arguments that have been put by the government in this case are not sufficient. I believe that they have to admit before this Senate that they have made an error. They have to work out a way of purging that error to this place and to the democracy of Australia.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is pretty clear what has happened here: the boys have got it wrong. I say `the boys' because it was a very limited number of people on the other side who decided to dream up this particular tax change. It was principally Mr Costello, the Treasurer. On the Tuesday he was full of confidence, full of bravura that this was going to be the great micro&hyphen;economic reform, the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> greatest thing to hit the decks for some years. By the end of the week they suddenly found out that he would not be able to get it up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that Senator Short has changed his language. Yesterday when this matter was raised in question time he was talking about the statement which came from the Treasurer's office on Tuesday as though it were a proposal. We said it was an announcement and he said it was a proposal. Today he realised that it was an announcement, and `announcement' is the term he chose to use.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That statement which came out on Tuesday, 11 June at 3.15 p.m. stated very clearly what it referred to. There was a long list of all the different bodies to whom it would apply&mdash;public railways, public transport authorities, Commonwealth and state governments. It goes through a long list down to passenger buses, ambulances for use by a hospital or ambulance society, fire engines and so on. The reason for that, and the reason why these announcements are made in this way, is it stops speculation. It stops some people taking advantage of what is going to be an imminent government decision before the legislation has actually gone through the parliament and thereby profiting from that elapse of time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If they had only listened to the Premier of Queensland, Mr Borbidge, who made it perfectly clear on the Wednesday when he said, when thinking through the ramifications of this measure:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Did he&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, Mr Costello&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">set out to cause massive financial problems for organisations like Guide Dogs for the Blind?</PARA>
<PARA>He clearly saw the implications of the announcement which was made on the Tuesday but by the time we got around to the Friday the story had changed. The government realised that despite all the confidence, bravura, arrogance, posturing and hairy chestedness of the Treasurer this thing was not going to get up because the states were not going to agree to it. It was at that point they tried to pull the fat out of the fire.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One has to have some sympathy for the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Short, because in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1695"> this respect he can claim some blamelessness&mdash;that is, he was not involved. It all happened, it is perfectly obvious, entirely without him. Nobody rushed around and said, `Jim, what do you think about this? Jim, would you like to add some of your economic expertise to this? Would you like to see whether there are some implications we haven't thought of?' In both yesterday's and today's question time he was in the unfortunate position of playing catch&hyphen;up football, teaching himself the rules while people kept throwing him the ball. Unfortunately, it is not working very well. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the privately expressed understatement of Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett, it was the most amateurish shambles he had ever attended.</PARA>
<PARA>When he says that, I have to agree with him absolutely. When all this shambles was going on, when they were trying to pull the fat out of the fire on the Friday, what did they do? They said, `We'd better put out another announcement.' They sought by that announcement to clarify the situation, to signal some form of retreat. But, as Senator Faulkner and Senator Sherry have clearly pointed out, they forgot the process of making announcements. They forgot the statutory requirement upon them to give seven days notice in the way that is prescribed by the legislation. They are in this embarrassing position today because they forgot that requirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> When you look at the style with which they have conducted this affair&mdash;when you look at the verve and style with which they went to the Premiers Conference and made these announcements to the press but subsequently had to try to pull the fat out of the fire&mdash;you have to have serious worries about how this crowd is going to get a budget through the Senate. Senator Faulkner made a prediction earlier that he did not think in the life of this parliament Senator Short would continue in his ministerial position. I think I can make a shorter term pronouncement than that. I am very sad I will not be here to see it but I will still make this prediction: I cannot see how this government is going to get a budget through this Senate with the way it is carrying on now. If it is going to be this disorganised, if it is going to be this shambolic, if it is&mdash;as Mr Kennett describes&mdash;an amateurish sham bles, it will never get the budget through the Senate.

<STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(3.44 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The national forest policy, by virtue of its lack of real initiatives to get logging out of native forests or to ensure secure preservation of high conservation value forests is a blueprint for unsustainable logging practices. The national forest policy statement proposed getting export woodchipping out of native forests by the year 2000. This government is showing a commitment to doing exactly the opposite by having no commitment to a reduction in the yearly woodchip quota.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, there is great concern throughout the community that this government is about to raise the ceiling on the woodchip quotas and declare open slather on our nation's unprotected forest heritage. In relation to this matter, Dr Bob Brown said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . our wild forests will be fed at an unprecedented rate into the rubbish tips of the northern hemisphere.</PARA>
<PARA>In relation to the government's Natural Heritage Trust announcement, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It makes the Natural Heritage Trust repair ethic look like applying bandaids to the hand that holds the chainsaw.</PARA>
<PARA>In his usual colourful language, he has hit the nail on the head.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Four years after the drafting of this national forest policy statement, we still do not have a single hectare more of old growth forests in secure conservation reserves. We have many precious areas proposed for protection, yet all of this is teetering on the outcome of fickle political will. Meanwhile the chainsaws are continuing in the south&hyphen;west of Western Australia, the north of New South Wales, East Gippsland and Tasmania. This government will not even give a commitment to protecting areas already identified as having outstanding natural values by the Australian Heritage Commission's register of the national estate in the south&hyphen;west of Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Against this alarming backdrop comes a signal of hope. International governments are now echoing what countless scientific studies from the Barnett report in Western Australia to the Resource Assessment Commission's timber inquiry at a national level have told us, that logging old growth native forests is not sustainable. It is not possible to simply regrow an old growth forest ecosystem that has taken thousands of years to develop and is a delicate and extraordinarily complex self&hyphen;sustaining system. Once you have destroyed it, it is gone. Plantations regrow; forests do not. They certainly cannot be replaced by the monoculture, even&hyphen;aged, simplified forest plantations we put in their place and call regeneration or regrowth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Greens have no objections whatsoever to plantation timbers being used. To use plantation timbers is ecologically sustainable; to have agroforestry is ecologically sustainable. We should be planting more trees on already cleared lands. We should be preventing further land clearance for agricultural or any other purposes. We ought to be utilising those resources so that the timber industry can have an ecologically sustainable base. It is not possible to do that if we are clearing old growth forests in the guise of setting up plantations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead of looking at that plantation based industry on cleared land, forests that are hundreds of years old are being progressively juvenilised. They have been simplified, stripped of undergrowth and the moss covered fallen logs essential to survival of so many <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1700"> rare and endangered species. These new regrowth forests or monocultures are lacking in old trees with hollows for small marsupials, lacking tree ferns, lichens, vines and all the wonderful biodiversity for which old growth forests are the pool. Instead, under the national forest policy statement we are turning our forests into tree farms; uniform, static, lifeless wood factories where few animals move, few birds call, streams become dry and the soil infertile.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know also from a hard economic perspective that these forests will never reach the yield of plantations and agroforestry on already cleared land. In Western Australia plantations yield three times that of regenerated forest, whilst agroforestry can yield as much as 10 times as much. In this situation they also fulfil the essential secondary purpose of lowering the water table and reducing the crippling salinity affecting our farmlands. Still the national forest policy keeps us bound to native forests, bound to continued species and habitat extinction and bound to economic loss under enormous subsidisation of a timber industry that cannot keep itself afloat and sheds more and more rural jobs every day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 22 May this year the Western Australian Conservation Council received a letter from the Dutch Ministry of Transport, Public Works and Water Management indicating its decision not to buy karri from primary, that is, old growth, forest. Their intention was to buy karri from the south&hyphen;west of Western Australia for canal linings in the Netherlands. After an extensive period of assessment and investigation between the government of The Netherlands and the Western Australian Department of Conservation and Land Management, the Dutch came to the conclusion that to import karri from the south&hyphen;west of Western Australia would be to exploit an unsustainable resource.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This decision is of the utmost significance. It will set a precedent not only for the Netherlands but for the European Community and the world. The Dutch are world leaders in environmental standards. It stands to reason that if they will not buy karri, no&hyphen;one else with environmental and ethical concerns will either. As I said before, that is a most hopeful <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> thing that has happened. The people in Western Australia who know that our beautiful karri and marri forests are unique in all the world and who see their destruction with grave concern and feel totally powerless have at least gained some vindication from overseas. It is an international view of what we are doing to our precious old growth forests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Dutch government decided it would only buy karri from existing areas of sustainably managed production forests. Their definition of `sustainable' is much more extensive and sensible than ours. It includes monitoring for biodiversity, the necessity for and extent of buffer zones, the extent of forest diseases, the amount of prescribed burning and implications for climate change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The karri which did come from appropriate regional regrowth plantations was too small to fulfil their requirements. The WA forestry practices failed miserably in other ways. When the conservation and land management departments management plans are based on those of interstate authorities and vice versa, this also has clear implications for forest management nationally. With Australia's recent record on the environment we are looking at becoming outsiders in a global community already committed to drastic action against the ecological collapse imminent on this planet. Affluence such as ours relative to that of developing countries means that there is no excuse for continued destruction of our very life support systems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have the technology and the ability to create a sustainable wood products industry. We do not need to clear our forests to service a foreign debt of 50 per cent of GDP, or to scratch out a meagre existence with unsustainable farming practices, or to get fuel for basic cooking or hygiene, or to raise cash crops. To continue to devastate our last remaining native forests as per the national forest policy is to continue an ecological violation of not just domestic but international proportions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Dutch decision holds some grave messages for the future of the forest industry in Australia. Either log forests sustainably on farmland and leave the old-growth forests alone or risk a crippled timber industry in both domestic and international markets. This <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1701"> is not the assertion merely of an impassioned conservationist community or the majority of Australians&mdash;even though it is that&mdash;but it is of hard economic reality direct from the global community. That is why it is of vital importance on a day when this government is considering its actions in relation to woodchip export licences. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This MPI debate has been brought to the Senate by the Greens (WA). In terms of the language of their submission, one can get some indication of their position in relation to the forest debate in Australia. That position seems to be fundamentally at odds with that of the major political parties in this country. I am not sure what the position of the Democrats is, but we might learn more during this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unlike the coalition and unlike the Labor Party, the Greens are opposed to the national forest policy statement which, as I recall, was entered into in 1992. It was signed by the Commonwealth government, the premiers of each of the states, and the chief ministers of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. What that agreement sought to achieve was a dual objective: on the one hand, there is resource security, which is premised on the legitimacy of responsible harvesting within native forests and, on the other hand, there is a comprehensive, adequate and representative conservation reserve system. So, in other words, the agreement between the Commonwealth and all of the states sought to achieve both outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now, as I read the matter submitted by the Greens for debate in this place, what Senator Chamarette is really saying is that the Greens remain opposed to that statement and, as I know, there are some conservation groups within this community that are opposed to it also. In other words, they start from the premise that they are opposed to all forestry activities within native forests. Therefore, they are simply not on board with this process. They are irrelevant to this process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our position is that we are wanting to find a proper balance between resource security for the forest industry that can responsibly harvest some of our forest products. It should be <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> done in a way that can maintain jobs and provide a livelihood for Australians and a hope for the families and children of people who are involved in the forest industry. Also, to address the&mdash;</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Greens do not have to worry about economic consequences. It is also necessary to address the major deficiency in our current account in forest goods. As Senator Chamarette may or may not know, we currently run a wood and paper deficit in this country of some $2 billion a year. About 10 per cent of our current account deficit is made up of wood and paper products. Senator Chamarette, I fear that some of those goods that we import are produced from forest products that are harvested in a far less responsible way than Australian forestry practices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other half of the objective, which I would have thought the Greens would support but which they do not opt to be part of, is to provide for the long-term benefit of this nation in terms of comprehensive, adequate and representative conservation reserves&mdash;something that some of us have sought for years and years. But, again, when the Australian Greens have an opportunity to participate to a process to achieve that outcome, they abdicate. They are not prepared to come on board, so they are not prepared to participate in a process that can achieve major conservation objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the one hand, I am surprised about that but, on the other hand, I am not surprised. We have witnessed in recent months the astonishing revelation of what happens when the Greens and the Australian Democrats&mdash;both of whom claim to be here largely representing a conservation constituency&mdash;are presented with the opportunity of a $1 billion Natural Heritage Trust to reinvest in the natural capital of Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It certainly was. Of course, the ALP was committed in government, and remains committed in opposition, to the full implementation of the national forest policy statement. In my role as the former environment minister in the Labor government I was very committed to ensure the conservation objectives of the NFPS were implemented. Federal Labor was prepared to make the tough decisions that were required to implement the national forest policy statement. At times that involved some very difficult negotiations with state governments, to bring them on board to achieve the policy vision that is contained within the national forest policy statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The central conservation objective of the NFPS was its commitment to the establishment of a comprehensive, adequate and representative system of reserves for our forests. Importantly, I think, the NFPS also contains an agreement that, until the assessments of the full range of environmental and heritage values are completed and the reserve system is established, activities that might significantly affect those areas of old growth forest or wilderness that are likely to have high conservation value should be avoided. Of course, that has been colloquially known as `the moratorium clause' of the NFPS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The NFPS makes it clear that the Commonwealth does have certain responsibilities in relation to protection of our forests. We have particular responsibilities in terms of protection of World Heritage values, protection of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> biodiversity, endangered species, Aboriginal heritage and also National Estate values.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that the previous Labor administration was able to do something that no other government has done before. We tried to solve what traditionally has been the most difficult and contentious environment issue of recent years. Our approach to this was by implementing the national forest policy statement and creating a world&hyphen;class system of reserves to protect our high conservation value native forests and the biodiversity that those forests support. Also, we treated seriously our obligations to ensure that those forests outside the reserve system were managed in a way that was ecologically sustainable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous Labor government went about this process in a very systematic manner. We involved all groups in the community which had an interest in the forest. That included the industry, trade unions, community groups and environmental groups&mdash;effectively community interests from both sides of the green divide. We recognised the absence of agreement on what criteria should be used to establish a forest conservation reserve system and took the initiative to set up a group of eminent scientists to make recommendations to the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In July of last year the Labor government, on the advice of this group, decided on the Commonwealth criteria for a national forest reserve system. Those criteria were designed to establish a world&hyphen;class forest conservation reserve system. They included a broad benchmark of protecting 15 per cent of the pre&hyphen;1750 distribution of each forest community, the retention of at least 60 per cent of all old growth, increasing up to 100 per cent in some cases for rare old growth, and, of course, our commitment to protect at least 90 per cent, ranging through to 100 per cent, of all wilderness. We also recognised the importance of off&hyphen;reserve management to achieve our conservation objective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The scientific integrity of these criteria was endorsed by the peak environment groups&mdash;the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and the national biodiversity council. It is important not to forget the role that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1703"> the states played in relation to this. You need to remember that the NFPS is a state and Commonwealth agreement. That means that it requires not just a commitment from the Commonwealth but state cooperation as well in order for the statement to be effectively implemented. The then Prime Minister, Mr Keating, recognised this in his statement of 22 December 1994 when he announced that the government was putting in place some very important measures to break the impasse that had been reached on the implementation of the NFPS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think a problem for the resolution of the forest issue is that state and territory governments have primary responsibility for forest management in this country. They hold the data. They hold the maps. They are the forest managers. They are the agencies and governments that really decide the final composition of the reserve system. This leaves the Commonwealth with only a very limited avenue for involvement in the forest industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The federal Labor government took on the critical role of driving the national forest policy statement by fully utilising those limited opportunities that were available to us. The lever that was used was the export woodchip licence renewal process. It is not the best lever. It is an inadequate way for the Commonwealth to enter into the forests issue but it was a responsibility from which the Labor administration did not duck.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We never backed away from our strong commitment to protect the high conservation value native forests in this country, regardless of the unremitting battle that took place with conservative politicians and conservative state premiers in this country. Throughout the whole process, the Labor government remained committed to the establishment of a world class forest conservation reserve system based on criteria that were welcomed by interested parties right across the board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did we get from the coalition, then in opposition, on these issues? It gave no commitment to criteria for a national system of forest reserves. The best it came up with was a recognition that the 15 per cent biodiversity benchmark was a worthwhile objective. We said then, and we are seeing now, that this <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> was an escape clause for the coalition to drop back to a 10 per cent criterion which is preferred by conservative state governments. The coalition always conceded that in some areas, particularly in Queensland and northern New South Wales, the 15 per cent would not be applied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition did not give an indication of support to levels of protection for old-growth and wilderness. It did not give any commitment for funding for proper comprehensive regional assessments and regional forest agreements, while Labor set itself the objective in our wood and paper industry strategy of phasing out the export of woodchips in native forests in favour of downstream processing by the year 2000. The best the coalition could offer was&mdash;and I quote from its policy&mdash;`domestic processing is preferable to woodchip exporting'. The coalition gave no commitment to ensuring that competition policy principles would apply to state forest agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe the contribution that the previous Labor government made in relation to this debate, particularly in 1995, was that for the first time we managed to really move the national forest policy statement on so there could be a long-term solution to properly protect our high conservation value native forests in this country. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Democrats will be supporting this urgency motion. We believe it is a continuing disgrace that our native forests are being woodchipped&mdash;in particular, that they continue to be clear felled at such a rate. I make no bones about it: the reason we are in this mess is that the previous Labor government did very little to put our old-growth forests, our mature forests and rainforests, out of the reach of the chippers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government did not protect adequate stands of forest in East Gippsland where&mdash;and I have seen it myself in past months&mdash;area that include rainforest are still being clear&hyphen;felled. It did not protect magnificent stands of jarrah forest in Western Australia. I remember the Sharpe block 6 which was accidentally logged. It did not protect <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1704"> adequate stands of old-growth forest or rainforest, and in many cases a combination of both, in Tasmania. The high conservation forests in New South Wales have been at risk and are continuing to be at risk under this new government's policies. This madness, a legacy from the last Labor government, means that at least 5 million tonnes of our prime forest which should be preserved will be lost this year. They should have been preserved because of their intrinsic value, their extraordinary beauty, their complex, unique biodiversity&mdash;ecosystems that are found nowhere else in this world. They should have been protected because of their important value as water catchments and for many other purposes, including tourism. They should have been protected, for example, to prevent further erosion of our fragile soils. Instead, they will be turned into woodchips and exported.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The national forest policy statement is not worth the paper it is written on. Not only are the state governments flagrantly disobeying its conservation intent, but the document itself is another excuse for unsustainable logging to continue indefinitely. The policy is industry oriented and the process is to create regional forestry agreements to effectively guarantee supplies&mdash;that is, until the trees run out and they simply have to give up. We must ask: why is this government supplying such an unsustainable dinosaur industry&mdash;a dinosaur that is gobbling up our native forests, and we are actually paying for it to do that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday, the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) tried to justify an increase in woodchip export quotas when he said, `There is timber left on the forest floor and this is therefore a waste.' Yes, there is timber left. So firstly we have to ask: why are we still cutting down trees for woodchip? I have seen perfectly good logs going into the mill at Eden. I have sat at the turn&hyphen;off on the Pacific Highway and watched millable timber, truck load after truck load, going into that mill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have stood with Senator Bell at Triabunna in Tasmania on the east coast and again watched millable timber, truck load after truck load, being sent to the chippers. I have walked through the Wombat forest in central Victoria and seen huge volumes of timber just <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> left rotting on the forest floor&mdash;much of it canopy; a lot of it either twisted or split. In other words, they have taken out the best, the straight and the solid timber, chipped that and left the rest on the forest floor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point I make is that this industry was set up to use waste. They have not done so unless it has been forced on them. They have made an economic decision that it is cheaper to chip the long, straight timber and they have left on the forest floor what they should have been chipping.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now they come back and say, `There is some wood left on the floor. We want to use the canopy now. We have decided we will chip what is not straight.' Here the minister jumps to attention and says, `Right. We will look at increasing the quota,' rather than saying to them, `Surely this is why woodchipping was allowed in the first place, to use the waste. Why are you continuing to clear&hyphen;fell such huge areas and leaving the waste on the forest floor in the first place?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to look at some of the other arguments the industry puts before us. I will just go through some of the papers that have come across my desk. They argue that regrowth occurs faster if they clear&hyphen;fell as opposed to selectively log. Technically this may be so in some cases, but let us be very clear about this. Regrowth is not the regrowth of the forest. Regrowth is usually regrowth of one or two species. Indeed, the trees&mdash;I have seen this happen in East Gippsland&mdash;in surrounding coupes that they do not want reseeding into logged areas are cut out to ensure that the only seed trees in the surrounding areas are those that will grow the particular couple of varieties they want for their chippers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1705"> Let us be clear: a forest system is not restored. Indeed, to actually get a forest back&mdash;if you can do it&mdash;will take hundreds of years. Work that has been done suggests that it is at least 200 years before we start seeing full ecosystems returning. In Tasmania it is more likely to be around 400 to 450 years before mature eucalypt forests are there again. Of course, we have to wonder what is going to happen to the various species in the mean time. Presumably they go into some sort of hibernation for several hundred years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What it is all about is getting that regrowth back quickly so that the industry can go back in 10 or 15 years and clear&hyphen;fell again. What they get the second time is only suitable for pulp or for chips. It is nothing like the volume they got the first time, but this is really only about money. It is very clear and very easy to go through and take it all out the second time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The economic argument, if we have to go to that, is a spurious one. Here I really wonder, having listened to the minister's speech, why he is not speaking on behalf of the Treasurer (Mr Costello). I really do wonder about an environment minister who comes in here and tries to justify the clear&hyphen;felling of our native forests with an economic argument. But we will talk economics. We will talk economic rationalism for a moment and we will actually look at the utter economic madness it is to turn our native forests into woodchips.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A report released by Dr Andrew Dragun, senior lecturer in law, economics and public policy at La Trobe University, found that the Victorian government directly spent $90 million on logging for a return of $40 million in a 12-month period. In other words, the Victorian taxpayers subsidise the industry to the tune of $50 million a year. Dr Dragun goes further and says that, when you take all costs into account, a more reasonable estimate of the annual subsidy could be in the order of $385 million. He called this an industry social welfare policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The combined debts of the forestry commissions around the country&mdash;I am quite happy to go through them state by state&mdash;are over $5 billion. The debts are: Queensland, $1.66 billion; New South Wales, $1.12 billion; Victoria, $1.17 billion; Tasmania, $565 million; and Western Australia, $481 million. Only my home state of South Australia is actually able to show a profit. Why? Because my home state gets 90 per cent of its sawlogs from plantations. That is where the real future of this industry lies. Consulting economist Francis Grey has identified 23 types of effective subsidy to this industry.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It makes good economic sense to actually keep our native forests intact. Why? Not only do they provide habitat, including for endangered species, they also store greenhouse gases. It is amazing to see the minister come in here and talk about revegetation when he is actually supporting policies that cut down the trees faster than they are being replanted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If he really was serious about our greenhouse policy, we would be protecting our native forests and we would be trebling or quadrupling the planting and, in particular, providing some incentives for people to move out of the native forests and into plantations. This is where some of the very difficult decisions have to be made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some areas in this country, some small country towns, where if people want to keep working in forestry industries they are going to have to look at moving into the tourism industry in the forests rather than felling trees. If they are going to keep felling trees, then they will have to look at policies such as have already been implemented in New South Wales where these people are given first option at jobs next to some of the new plantations, such as out at Oberon. As new plantation forests come on stream, people who are still working in the forestry industry&mdash;on the south coast of New South Wales or in East Gippsland, for example&mdash;are given the opportunity and the financial support to move themselves and their families so that they can keep working in the industry they have chosen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another economic reason for keeping our native forests is that they hold the soil together and provide organic matter for it. Also, they help to ensure clean water. I mention the ridiculous situation in East Gippsland where the catchment for Mallacoota is still being logged and is under threat of further logging. To keep felling the Betka makes absolutely no economic sense whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A hectare of old&hyphen;growth mountain ash forest clear&hyphen;felled may produce $270 worth of woodchips once, but studies show&mdash;indeed, a study commissioned by the Victorian government shows&mdash;that more than $6,000 of water can be produced by that same forest, year after year.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1706">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion I stress: native forest logging is not sustainable. It is going to finish. Let's finish it before we destroy our forests.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People on all sides of this parliament do care deeply about the sustainable use of our forests. In the use of the word `sustainable', I mean ecological and economic sustainability. The two necessarily go hand in hand. There is no need for them to be separated. The processes put in place in some regards by the previous government and which will be added to and supplemented by this government do seek to ensure that we see ecological and economic sustainability more appropriately meshed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the most excellent policy launched by the then shadow minister for the environment, Senator Kemp, who happens to have joined us in the chamber, the coalition made it quite clear that it was committed to the protection of Australia's high conservation value native forests. I am sure Senator Chamarette would have been pleased to have seen that when the policy was released. We also have strongly supported the national forest policy statement. This is something that the Greens (WA) and many environmental movements do not support, because they do not see it as the solution to the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a pragmatic view. I have been involved in the political and bureaucratic side <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the forestry debate for a relatively short time, although I have had a life&hyphen;long association with forests and spend much of my recreational time in forests, enjoying them for their many values that enhance my life. I do care about forests. However, I do not pretend to care about them any more or any less than any other person in this place. I believe that Senator Chamarette and many of the people she represents have a strong, deep, passionate and genuine interest in the forests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we as the government have to do and what the previous government had to do was try to balance those genuine concerns about maintaining old growth forests; try to achieve sustainable practices in other native forests; try to develop a sensible balance with the plantation establishment; and create some economic certainty in the development of downstream processing, which has been missing in Australia for many years. The development of downstream processing, value adding to our forest products and our plantation production, has been missing in Australia because of the economic uncertainty created by the previous government and because of the ad hoc environmental approval processes that often lacked either transparency or any basis in logic or science. The people who were trying to make decisions to establish some downstream processing in Australia were simply not able to do so in the best interests of their shareholders as they were surrounded by economic and environmental uncertainty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1707"> The coalition hopes we can solve that problem by creating a better economic climate in which to make decisions. We also hope to develop more trust between the state and federal levels of government when handling forest issues. Prior to the election of the coalition government there was an enormous amount of mistrust. As Senator Faulkner said, these negotiations between federal and state governments are never going to be easy. The states have significant and virtually total control over land management issues&mdash;and quite properly so. The federal government has only the very rough and remote lever of export controls to use as suasion. Senator Faulkner recognised that it is not a particular ly sound policy instrument to use. But we do intend to proceed with those processes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">`It is very hard to balance the economic and ecological outcomes that one would desire as a government and as a community. It is not so hard when you are a Democrat or a Green senator because, ultimately, you do not have to bear much responsibility for balancing those things. I am not saying that you do not have a very legitimate role. It helps to balance the process when the Greens and the Democrats put forward a position which, nationally, is not sustainable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition is committed to achieving a process of comprehensive regional assessments. We believe that it is only through these comprehensive assessment processes that you can well and truly assess and cover enhanced and valuable data in relation to biodiversity, old growth, wilderness, world heritage, national estate and indigenous interests. We need to assess the ecological sustainability of current forestry practices. Equally, we need to have a thorough assessment of the economic and social consequences of the future regime of managing our forests. The coalition will do this in a way that will develop better outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We recognise that this is not a debate that is ever possible to win&mdash;at least, that is my view. We will never satisfy those people who never want to see a chainsaw go anywhere near a forest&mdash;and I really do respect the people who hold those views. We will never totally satisfy an industry that is demanding a resource. But what we can do is achieve an outcome of resource security without threatening the crucial values contained in forests&mdash;all of the values that forests contain&mdash;and which ensures that we protect forests for future generations in Australia and for people across the world, because this is a global issue. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA>I am quite surprised that the minister has not actually made any statement and that he is not in the chamber to make any statement in relation to the tabling of this document considering what has been involved with this issue over the last couple of years. The review of the management and safety in the offshore operations of BHP Petroleum starts badly and, in my opinion, continues badly. For a start, section 1.1.2 on the very first page states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The following were the terms of reference for this review:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> To examine the circumstances of the recent <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Griffin Venture</EMPHASIS>  incidents to provide advice on whether there were any cultural, management, operational, procedural or training deficiencies which may have contributed to the incidents; and to review subsequent measures undertaken by BHP Petroleum since the incident . . . </PARA>
<PARA>They were not the terms of reference. We asked for that to be the terms of reference and the minister refused to change the terms of reference. In fact, several phone calls were made and the media also checked with the minister to find out whether those terms of reference could be changed so that, officially, the terms of reference could deal with the incidents properly and the inquiry could try to get to the bottom of the 1994 incident as well as the 1996 incident. But that was not the case because there was no agreement that the terms of reference would change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is not a good start when on the very first page the indications are that the terms of reference were officially changed. They never were. If they were, we certainly did not hear about them, and we certainly asked on a number of occasions. We were advised that all of those incidents could be looked at, but there was no change to the terms of reference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of issues in this report which I believe you could drive a truck through. Let me give an example. Section 2.2.3 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are conflicting opinions about whether the gas&hyphen;freeing process would have proceeded in the absence of Mr Visscher's intervention . . .  <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>This was in regard to the May 1994 incident where, during a potential gas&hyphen;freeing incident, the vessel could have exploded. The major point that was made when that original document came out was that the vessel was not in jeopardy because there was no source of ignition. There is clear evidence now, and has been all along, that there was a potential source of ignition. If that was the case, the next point says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Visscher's allegation that the purge pipes were not adequately earthed is also subject to conflicting evidence. In my opinion, however, on the balance of probabilities, the pipes were probably not earthed properly.</PARA>
<PARA>If the pipes were probably not earthed properly, it is saying that BHP probably lied. That is the reality. If the company has never actually said, `Well, that was the case; there was a purged pipe put together with tape, held together by drums, not earthed', and never actually admitted to that, we are encountering a situation where BHP probably lied. That, strangely enough, is in contravention of the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act. It is simply not good enough to brush these issues under the carpet. There is never going to be a real change in the way things operate on these very important vessels if there is never a real change of culture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will give an example of how frightened I am of the current situation. The current word in BHP says that the next time BHP management hear of&mdash;I am paraphrasing&mdash;an incident, the persons concerned will suffer the full wrath of BHP for jeopardising BHP's operating licence. What message does that give you, after all this time? I can tell you the message it gives to its employees: if you have made a mistake, do not tell us because you're going to go for the high jump, just like we put the whistleblower through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In reality, the indications are that whilst we still have a situation where BHP is arguing on pedantics about whether or not the vessel was in jeopardy because the process was stopped by the whistleblower, we are never going to change the situation so that we can be sure that the culture on board vessels operated by BHP will really change and that the feeling of the people working for BHP will be such that they feel free to discuss these issues.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1710">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What kind of issues are we talking about here? We are talking about production related issues. If you stop the gas&hyphen;freeing on the tank that is required for oil storage, it costs something like $2 million a day. So the decisions are production driven. As the margins on offshore oil production are squeezed at the moment, unfortunately, more and more we may see a situation where the margins appear to drive the safety culture. That is extremely dangerous. We will put lives at risk and we have the potential for the worst maritime disaster in Australia's history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we never agree to address this situation in this parliament, if we never decide that we are going to get to the bottom of this and if we think that we are doing a favour to any company by allowing them to dig a hole around an error and a series of errors, we are doing nobody a favour. Most of the statements that are incorrect, you can find evidence to disprove. Therefore, if we as the Senate really want to find out what happened and what is going on with the safety culture of BHP, we are doing them no favours whatsoever in accepting this report. We will have to sit down and find out what happened. Who was the designated authority? What role did that designated authority play? As I said, you could drive a truck through these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second report to the designated authority went out on Friday, 10 February. The Western Australian Department of Minerals and Energy was scheduled to do an investigation on 13 February. There was in fact no time. Those bookings would have had to be made in advance. There was no time for that particular inspection to have been arranged as a result of that particular report. Yet, along with all of this, we hear that the Western Australian Department of Minerals and Energy made an inspection in relation to the incident. There were no notes. There was no indication of what questions were asked. In fact, the inspectors themselves have finally admitted that it was a routine inspection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is evidence available that shows that BHP, after that date, in a letter to Mr Visscher, indicated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In our further discussions at your home on 28 February, you indicated that you had no confidence <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in the ability of the review team, in response to which I suggested we seek the involvement of the Western Australian Department of Mines and Energy as a third party to assess the facts of the matters.</PARA>
<PARA>This was talking about a meeting that took place on 28 February. If this meeting took place on 28 February, it would be a bit hard to say BHP could have retrospectively asked the Western Australian Department of Minerals and Energy to provide a report of the incident and go and inspect the vessel on 20 February. There is something wrong with those dates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nearly every statement you look at in this report has problems. This is not good enough. We are talking about the reputation of Australia's companies. We are talking about the ecology of the Western Australian coast, and perhaps other coasts, because the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Jabiru Venture</EMPHASIS> also had a similar gas&hyphen;freeing incident this year off the Northern Territory coast.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I would like to respond briefly to Senator Margetts. As Senator Margetts will be aware, this government inherited a potential problem on these particular vessels. In consultation with the Northern Territory government and the Western Australian government, it was decided that what we would do is appoint a world expert in this field, Dr Tony Barrell. Dr Barrell is well recognised and respected by just about every group in this particular field&mdash;and it is a very specialised field.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For this reason, I must say that I was particularly disappointed in Senator Margetts, who I think might be the only person in the world to cast aspersions on the integrity of Dr Barrell. I think Senator Margetts also complained that the terms of reference that we initially put to Dr Barrell were not changed in the way she wished. In fact, I spoke to her privately in this chamber about it. One of my staff wrote her a letter. In the initial briefing with Dr Barrell, I instructed him to meet not only with Mr Tim Visscher but also with Senator Margetts. Dr Barrell did that.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1711">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My belief is that Dr Barrell brought down a report which BHP themselves have taken very seriously&mdash;and it must have been with some difficulty for a company that I believe holds safety in a very high regard. In fact, it is of interest that the chief executive of BHP spoke to me himself personally about it and expressed his concern that somehow there had been a breakdown in the safety procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> This government does take offshore safety very seriously. This was the reason that we employed Dr Barrell as a consultant. The report itself examined a number of incidents. It gave credit, in fact, to the work done by Mr Visscher. Senator Margetts referred to a couple of points in the Barrell report by way of criticising it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dr Barrell examined a number of incidents. I think Senator Margetts was concerned that the initial terms of reference would just be limited to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Griffin Venture</EMPHASIS>. In fact, it was extended at my request, while not in the terms of reference, to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Jabiru Venture</EMPHASIS> and it covered the whole BHP program. Dr Barrell looked at the gas&hyphen;freeing incident on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Griffin Venture</EMPHASIS>, the valve failure and gas release incident on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Griffin Venture</EMPHASIS> on 29 May 1994 and again on 3 January 1996 and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Jabiru Venture</EMPHASIS> on 23 March.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although the primary focus of the report is on BHP's present and future petroleum arrangements, my main concern, as a relatively new responsible minister, was to ensure that BHP offshore personnel are safe&mdash;not to reinvestigate incidents that have already been examined, but to actually make sure that from the history that had been built up those people would benefit from such a report. That was the whole purpose of it. No-one wants to see a major disaster. As I indicated, Mr Visscher was responsible for putting forward a range of concerns about the incident.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Margetts has said, she was approached by Mr Visscher and, in the process, tabled six statutory declarations in November last year in conjunction with her notice of motion. Dr Barrell was aware of those statutory declarations, and that was part of the investigation process that went on. He concluded that, it being more than two years after the matter, it was difficult to determine <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> true facts. I would like to reiterate that there is no more respected person in this particular field than Dr Tony Barrell.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Part of the program of the investigation was to interview Mr Visscher himself. There was no attempt by anybody to cover up. In fact, one of the things that BHP did, and for which I think Dr Barrell congratulated them, was to open up the whole process. They were not interested in cover-ups. The chief executive of BHP himself read this report. If that is not starting from the top down, with regard to the concern that this company has to ensure that the safety of the people who work on their particular vessels is looked after, I do not know what is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">BHP has responded in a way on which I think one can only congratulate them. It is no joy for a company with a reputation like that of BHP to have a report like this come down. Anyone with any sort of balance or commonsense would appreciate that. They have addressed each of the issues. I will not go through them now, because time will preclude me from doing so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">BHP were given the report to look at and were given the opportunity to respond. Let me just say to you that in the conclusions to their response they have said that they accept Dr Barrell's conclusions, including those about past performance, which they admit quite freely was not satisfactory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They also point out that Dr Barrell reached several conclusions which show that BHP were on the right track. Right at the beginning of Dr Barrell's report, and I think that this should be remembered, he states that, in Australian terms, this is a relatively young industry compared with that of the North Sea. Of course, it is. He says that BHP is some 18 months through an all-embracing three-year program designed to deliver a comprehensive safety management system for its offshore <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1712"> facilities. He also states that significant improvements have already been achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is easy, Senator Margetts, to criticise a company like BHP. In my view they have responded in a very positive way. They have accepted the fact that there were problems in the past. They have also accepted the fact that there were design problems in the original vessel. I think that they have shown their good faith by moving to have those vessels shut down and refitted at a cost to BHP of $36 million.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is one of the most disgraceful episodes that I have come across, not in terms of what the Australian National Audit Office has done but in terms of what the audit office has discovered. This relates to one of Australia's major defence projects, a multimillion dollar project, a project that is central to Australia's defence <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and which was grossly and disgracefully mismanaged by the Labor government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It involves $1.1 billion and relates to an over the horizon early warning system. I will not deal with that at great length. Senator MacGibbon knows more about this than I do anyway, and he will be following me in dealing with this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What concerns me is not only the massive cost over-run but also the failure to deliver this project on time. It is massively over time and over cost and is not working. It seems to me that there is no confidence at the moment that it will work. Some of the major issues that have yet to be resolved have not apparently been resolved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what concerns me particularly is that, when Senator MacGibbon and I have raised this matter in the past in Senate estimates committees, when we have been concerned about how this has been going along, we received no indication at those committees about the extent of the problem that the audit office has now revealed. Of course, it is now up to this government to fix this mess. The extent of the deception of the people of Australia and of this parliament is evident in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Defence Annual Report 1994&hyphen;95</EMPHASIS>. The audit report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.14<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Defence Annual Report 1994&hyphen;95</EMPHASIS>  commented that JORN&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Jindalee Operational Radar Network&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">design activity was nearing completion, confidence that the specifications would be met was high and radar hardware was in production. The ANAO queried the basis for these comments since, at the time of the annual report, Telstra&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>who is the major contractor&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">had submitted less than 20 per cent of the JORN configuration item critical designs for review by the JPO. Defence explained that the comments were made in good faith . . . </PARA>
<PARA>They were totally wrong, totally incompetent, totally hopeless but they were made in good faith. I take them at their word. This means that they were incompetent rather than deceptive, in which case I withdraw the earlier word `deceptive' and replace it with `monumental incompetence'.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1713">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister involved at the time, Senator Ray, must be very embarrassed by this audit report. I know he certainly had a deep sense of integrity about his role as minister, and I hope he may at some time come into this chamber and explain his knowledge of the extent to which this parliament and the people of Australia have been misled. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Defence explained that the comments were made in good faith on the basis of advice before Telstra's JORN Technical Audit Report became available late in 1995. The ANAO considers that Defence needs to pay more attention to public accountability for expenditure of public funds and the basis of its comments about JORN in its published annual report.</PARA>
<PARA>Amen to all that. The defence department gets a caning in this report and it deserves it. What I find fairly difficult to understand is that it is evident from other parts of the audit report that Defence recognised there were problems long before the annual report was presented but seemed to hope that they would somehow go away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will read a few extracts from this leaflet because two problems emerge from it. Firstly, the monumental mess of this project and, secondly, the impact on Telstra, which I do not think Telstra ever advised us of. The fact is that Telstra is going to carry some very large losses out of this arrangement unless some changes are made. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The . . . (JORN) Project is a Defence initiative designed to provide significant strategic advantages for Australia. It requires the construction of a long&hyphen;range sky&hyphen;wave over&hyphen;the&hyphen;horizon radar (OTHR) network at an overall project cost of $1.1 billion. JORN will be used . . . for military purposes.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Defence, through its Jindalee Project Office (JPO), is responsible for overall management of the Project. The JPO's main function is to ensure that Telstra (the project's prime contractor) delivers JORN as agreed in the contract. Telstra is to be paid over $800 million for designing, developing, installing and presenting for acceptance two integrated radars&mdash;one at Longreach in Queensland and the other near Laverton in Western Australia. Both are to be controlled from a central facility at Salisbury in South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Project began in 1991 and&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>to use a polite expression&mdash;</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">has progressed more slowly than expected.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, it is way behind schedule. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1994 Telstra rescheduled JORN's completion from 1997 to 1999 and is proposing a further rescheduling, possibly to June 2000.</PARA>
<PARA>I would not be prepared to cross my fingers in the hope that it will be finished by then. The leaflet goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The necessary contract amendment to change the original completion date still needs to be negotiated with Defence.</PARA>
<PARA>The important points made by the audit office are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the outset Defence knew that JORN was a high&hyphen;risk development project and that Telstra was inexperienced in OTHR technology and defence system full-scale development methods.</PARA>
<PARA>So you had an inexperienced contractor and an incompetent person putting out the contract. According to the audit office:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to prompt satisfactory performance, progress payments should have been applied to better indicators of progress and payments withheld until their value was earned.</PARA>
<PARA>Instead, money kept on being churned out basically on the principle from Defence that they had to spend all their money by 30 June otherwise they would not be able to carry it forward. So whether or not the work had been done, whether it had been delivered or whether the project was going ahead, Defence kept churning the money out to these contractors with a disastrous consequence. That is, a great bulk of the money has now been spent on the project but only a relatively small proportion of the project appears to have been delivered. This report goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ANAO considers that this has led to significant misalignment between the value underpinning the project's originally&hyphen;planned progress milestones and the value of progress payments made. If current payment trends continue Defence's JORN full-scale development budget will be spent by mid&hyphen;1997 . . . but there will still be two or more years of system development work to be done, including the high&hyphen;risk, high&hyphen;cost, systems integration phase of the project.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With 80 per cent of the JORN prime contract target price of $814 million spent . . . less than 18 per cent . . . of JORN's 129 configuration items had passed critical design reviews . . . Of the 23 <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1714"> configuration items reviewed, only 5 per cent or 5 of the 94 hardware configuration items had passed through a `first&hyphen;article&hyphen;manufactured' test.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a total mess. It goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Overall, about 28 per cent of JORN's software has now been produced. The . . . software joint venture has produced about 19 per cent . . . of the . . . source lines of software . . . Telstra's other major JORN subcontractor has produced about 49 per cent . . . of the . . . source lines of code now estimated to be required . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, only a relatively small proportion of the stuff has been delivered but 80&hyphen;odd per cent of the money has been spent. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Defence said in response to the audit that there was little doubt that JORN's cost will exceed the ceiling price and the loss will be borne by Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA>We did not hear anything about that from Telstra. It is not in its annual report as some contingent or expected liability.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not had time to read the Auditor&hyphen;General's report No. 28 of 1995&hyphen;96 in detail but I would agree wholeheartedly with Senator Baume that it is the worst report that I have ever seen the Australian National Audit Office issue. If you read between the genteel lines of prose, the report is absolutely scathing of the performance of the Department of Defence and Telstra on what is an absolutely major contract.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to pick up on another point raised by Senator Baume which has been an ongoing matter of concern for some of us on this side. Senator Baume, Senator Newman and I have pursued it time and time <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> again at estimates committees. We have been lied to and we have been treated with evasion by former ministers at the table and the representatives of the department. The matter is this: no account of the status of the Telstra contract on the Jindalee operational radar network, or JORN, project has been given to this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the duty of the executive government to be accountable to the parliament. The Labor Party, when in power, failed to account. This report is the first hard evidence given to this parliament that we have what Senator Baume has described as one of the greatest disasters&mdash;I would say probably the greatest disaster financially&mdash;in defence contracting history in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From memory, this was a six&hyphen;year contract for $1053 million in April 1991 prices. The report says that it was for $1.1 billion, which is close enough. Whether we were required to go ahead with it from a defence point of view is a debateable point but we went ahead with it because it was a non&hyphen;offensive system. In other words, it is a fixed system based in Australia. You cannot pick it up and move it around the country or take it overseas, so it was no threat. Therefore, Foreign Affairs went for the JORN system rather than the AWACS contract, which is the system we need for defence of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the JORN system we have area surveillance which is very imprecise. We know that something is out there, the system will alert us to it, but we have to identify the nature of the target with an AWACS system. I argue now, as I have always argued, that if it is a matter of priorities&mdash;if we can have only one or the other, as was the case with this contract because of financial constraints&mdash;AWACS was the way to go. But now it is six years too late for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The contract was awarded to Telstra. I was very surprised when that happened because Telstra had had no involvement at all in defence contracting, let alone in what is absolutely leading edge software integration of the massive system that JORN involved. It was as though someone went to the Ford motor company and asked it to build a mansion. The Ford motor company is an excellent <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1715"> builder of cars but building houses is not its line, any more than it was Telstra's business to get into this contract. Why the Labor government gave the contract to Telstra I am at a total loss to understand. We will never know.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government was quite incompetent in its contract negotiations. The sort of contract that was used for JORN was the same sort of contract for another highly sophisticated system, the Collins submarine. The Auditor General's response in the report includes the following statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This finding combined with the flawed construct of the contract alone would have been a major contributor to non performance of any prime contractor.</PARA>
<PARA>The government was at fault in the way it wrote the contract. It went to Telstra, which lacked any expertise. Telstra's approach to this massive contract of well over $1 billion was laissez faire. Telstra got the contract, patted itself on the back for getting it and did nothing&mdash;for years. It just drifted and dreamed along.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things Telstra did do was go to the United States&mdash;which it denied at the estimates hearings but I have had the United States' side of it&mdash;and demanded that the US hand over a lot of its research on over the horizon radar. In Australian folklore, over the horizon radar is an Australian invention; we are brilliant at it. That is not true. The Americans had been involved in over the horizon radar since about 1944 onwards. It is only in the last three years that they closed down their operational stations but they have a deal of research on it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra demanded as a right that the Americans give it all their research material. The Americans said, `Hang on a minute, there's no contract that obliges us to do that, there is no agreement with the Australian government.' Telstra behaved really quite badly, although it will not admit to that in public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we come to the surveillance of the contract by the Australian Department of Defence. This report makes out line by line that the Jindalee project office was absolutely incompetent. It knew that Telstra was falling behind, week by week, month by month, on its performance, yet the office did nothing <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> about it. As Senator Baume said, 80 per cent of the time for the contract has now gone, 80 per cent of the contract price has been paid and we have less than 20 per cent of the contract delivered. But we do not have anywhere near the completion of the software. We have not got even a quarter of the way with the software development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Put very simply, over the horizon radar is a high frequency radio signal which is bounced off the ionosphere and reflected from the earth's surface back off the ionosphere to signal station receivers close to the point of generation of the signal. The signal coming back after a transit distance of about 6,000 kilometres is very weak, and the heart of this highly complex process is a very sophisticated software program analysing the signal returns. Telstra, according to this report, is only about a quarter of the way down the path of developing this huge software program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once it has developed the software, it then has to go into systems integration, putting it all together. Anyone who has any knowledge of contemporary defence weapons systems knows that the final part of it, the systems integration&mdash;putting it all together and making it work&mdash;is what takes the time, is where the cost overruns, and is where the frustration comes in. It is all very well to put things together in a laboratory and have them working well as a series of black boxes, but when you put them in the field or on a weapons platform, that is when the problems start.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a classical set&hyphen;up that goes back to the 1960s of the American defence contracts with massive time overruns and massive cost overruns. There is no sign, there is no hope at all in this report that we are going to avoid that. If I had my way, I would recommend publicly that the JORN contract be cancelled as of now and we walk away from it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tragedy is, according to that report, that we have put in over $700 million worth of taxpayers' dollars and we are caught in the inevitable trap that these badly conceived, badly thought through and badly executed defence contracts always end up with. You end up putting such a huge amount of money in them and such a huge amount of time that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1716"> you are committed to going ahead with the completion of them, and that is the mess that the Labor government has left Australia in.

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">MEDICARE LEVY AMENDMENT BILL 1996</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill and the associated Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1996 are part of the Commonwealth's response to the horrific events at Port Arthur. This tragedy has concentrated attention on the fact that there are large holdings of types of rapid&hyphen;fire weapons in our community which are simply not justifiable in the overall national interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All Australian Governments are acting swiftly on tighter gun control, a significant element of which is a twelve month amnesty and compensation scheme. This scheme, likely to begin formally on 1 July, will require gun owners to hand in those guns to be the subject of nation&hyphen;wide bans in return for fair and proper compensation. This covers all self&hyphen;loading rifles, self&hyphen;loading shotguns and pump&hyphen;action shotguns, whether licensed or unlicensed, subject to very narrow exceptions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Through a one&hyphen;off increase of 0.2% in the Medicare levy, these bills will raise the necessary funds to re&hyphen;imburse states and territories for the direct cost of payments they will have made to relevant gun owners.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am reluctant at any time to add to the financial burden of Australians. But this bill imposes a special one year impost which I think most Australians will regard as necessary in the circumstances. Through contributing an amount estimated to cost someone on average weekly earnings a total of around $70 or $1.40 a week, Australians can assist <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in the greatest reduction of firearms ever contemplated in this or most other countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A very large total cost is involved. The estimate is that the increase in levy will raise around $500 million. The Commonwealth judges it to be in the national interest to offer assistance on such a scale to the states and territories, notwithstanding that gun control falls largely within their responsibilities. National leadership needs to be exercised so that the problem of the proliferation of these guns is confronted swiftly and adequately.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The terms of the `buy back' scheme will be subject to national agreement and I have made it clear to Premiers and Chief Ministers that funding by the Commonwealth is based on the strong agreement of all states and territories to implement the measures agreed at the meeting of Police Ministers on 10 May.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I note that a recent University of Canberra study supports the Government's conclusion that an increase in the Medicare levy for this purpose is the most desirable of several options, including on equity and efficiency grounds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rate of Medicare levy will be raised from 1.5 per cent to 1.7 per cent for the 1996&hyphen;97 income year only. The terms of the bill ensure that the rate will be returned to the present level of 1.5 per cent for the 1997&hyphen;98 and subsequent income years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will allow imposition of a proportion of the full Medicare levy, equivalent to a rate of 0.2%, on members of the Defence Forces, and in some circumstances members of their household, who are currently exempt from the Medicare levy. Again, this will be just for the duration of the 1996&hyphen;97 income year. The same income thresholds, reduced levy and phasing&hyphen;in arrangements applying to other taxpayers will apply.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This measure puts Defence personnel in the same position as other Australians required to meet this special community&hyphen;wide impost.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The figure of $500 million represents the best advice about the cost states and territories could face in meeting the direct cost of `buy back' arrangements. Any surplus will be returned to taxpayers through the Medicare levy system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Details of the national amnesty and `buy back' scheme are being worked on by a working party of senior Commonwealth and state officials. The clear objective is to offer incentives which secure a significant return of firearms as expeditiously as possible. This includes a regime of fair and proper compensation, with values set by people with appropriate expertise. It also includes significant penalties for those who fail to return banned weapons at the expiration of twelve months, with more serious penalties applying in respect of high fire&hyphen;power weapons. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1718"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I understand that the thinking at this stage is that the scheme of compensation will involve a schedule of values for particular categories of firearm, depending on condition. Such values would be set by a national panel which includes government and gun industry representation, and independent valuation expertise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am gratified by the response of most Australians to the leadership shown by all Governments on gun control. Many will be inconvenienced by this and other elements of the gun control package. It is a matter of honest regret that taxpayers need to meet this cost, and that law&hyphen;abiding gun owners need to surrender guns which they have found useful to them in one way or another.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rural community in particular are likely to feel the brunt of tighter restrictions, though primary producers will be able to use smaller magazine, low powered semi&hyphen;automatics where there is a demonstrable occupational need which cannot be met by other means. My experience of this community gives me every confidence that they will shoulder responsibly the burden that the new state gun laws will impose.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not enjoy imposing this degree of regulation and inconvenience, which reaches into many Australian homes. But when the whole of the matter is weighed, there is a greater good to be served in taking such comprehensive measures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The profound national trauma which followed the gun violence at Port Arthur has caused us to ask fundamental questions about what sort of firearms are acceptable in our community. Logic, not emotion, has carried all governments collectively to a conclusion that the availability of semi&hyphen;automatic rifles and shotguns should be severely circumscribed, and that there should be greater rigour generally in gun licensing and registration systems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All of us with public duties in this matter need to fully implement the agreement reached by Police Ministers, and to keep our compact with the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These historic measures are designed to avoid any slide into a `gun culture' in this country. We must build a better and safer community for the future.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Preamble, page 2 (line 6), after "adequate", insert "and ecologically appropriate". <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>This is a simple, very basic inclusion of the idea that public housing must be ecologically appropriate. We used the word `ecologically' rather than the word `environmentally' to acknowledge some of the broader issues of urban design. Consumption patterns were built in through housing choices rather than limiting consideration to basic energy efficiency and immediately obvious environmental impacts. I understand that there is broad party support for this amendment, and the Greens (WA) welcome that support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday I was speaking about the fact that public housing was both an environmental impact in terms of energy use and a social impact. In my remarks I talked about a part of the paragraph I was speaking to; in fact, I was quite explicit. So I will be addressing these types of issues in my amendments; that is, that public housing is often seen to have no connection with insulation or other energy and water conservation practices, with solar hot water heaters or with costs imposed on tenants, including transport costs. I think it is a problem that public housing is seen to have little relation with urban design, car dependency, access to services, import of fuel or other such elements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is a major problem that people cannot see the contradictions and waste in funding programs and having policies at all levels of government in relation to housing design and urban form and then spending a billion dollars a year on housing, ignoring everything else they are doing or advising. I think it is indicative that we have some good models like the Department of Defence, which is utilising some of the important economic advantages of the things that we have been advocating to defence housing, yet the department of housing cannot even see the connection in relation to public housing. That has been almost unbelievable. I am disappointed that my raising this issue is seen as a problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1720"> I have mentioned several factors already when speaking to earlier amendments, but I have a few more comments to make in order to make the connection clear. I would appreciate it if those views could be heard so that I do not need to repeat them in subse quent related amendments. If I can speak to the issues now, I will not bore you for too long. Those who know me know that, in general, I am known as the senator of short speeches, and that is why people rush to the chamber when they know I am getting up to speak. There are exceptions, and that is where the issue is complex and important to the Greens, but I do not just fill in time with political point scoring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to earlier amendments, I mentioned some of the impacts on urban form relating to where we put public housing and about the unfortunate trend to eliminate established public housing in central areas to build new houses on the fringes. This is an important ecological issue and an important social justice issue as well. It is absolutely relevant to all my amendments to both ecological sustainability and to offering choice of housing and location.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The location of public housing is important. I am speaking about the fact that for many people the outer fringes are not well served with public transport. Even when there is some service, it often takes many times longer to travel the same distance by public transport than it would by car. In some areas there are buses that travel only once a day, and that is on weekdays. The public transport falls in a heap on weekends and holidays. It becomes extremely difficult for people to negotiate the long distances from urban fringes without a car.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moreover, there are few, if any, suburban shops in many of these suburbs. People have to go to town to shop. Taxis will not go there because it is too far and they feel it is not worth their while. Of course, if you are in a public housing area, you are not going to be able to afford to take expensive taxis to go to the shops. There are few medical clinics with facilities as there are, for instance, around Fremantle, and schools and any social entertainment are also at a distance. The social problems of creating welfare ghettos are also well known.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So providing public housing in such areas without considering the urban impact would lock the poor into getting a car, which would usually be an old petrol&hyphen;guzzling bomb that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> uses leaded petrol, for which the poor will be penalised in fuel tax. For those with less money and for whom driving is difficult, you lock them into isolation which is built of lack of access to health and other services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are obviously difficulties in getting to work. So you have this cycle of people being expected to find a job, and it is actually being made difficult for them to choose in relation to access to jobs that are available. They have a lot of difficulty even getting to training courses, to job interviews or to an actual place of work. It is not an impossible situation, but we do make many people's lives far more difficult than there is any need to be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To add insult to injury, most of the disadvantages that we load such public tenants up with have an economic price tag. So it costs money to be disadvantaged. Think about when you go shopping. If you have to travel long distances, it is quite difficult to do that, even on public transport. If you have to walk or you have no other way to do that, then it is going to make it impossible.</PARA>

<PARA>This amendment is really connected to our amendment No. 6. I understand the opposition is willing to support our amendment No. 6 but not No. 5. I am sure Senator Faulkner will elucidate that. This amendment is simply about strengthening the language of this clause. I would like to see choice ensured, especially the sort of choice that I envisage in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1722"> my next amendment. I also believe that it is all too easy to offer choices that are not really functional choices. Something like the keystart program is not really a choice for many people, requiring, as it does, the promise of reasonable income and the ability to take on a standard loan. They still have the same amount to pay back but they end up getting it at a later time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, I have concerns with the way most of the genuine home ownership subsidy programs disappeared or were phased out around 1986&hyphen;87 and were replaced by schemes which allowed a number of home buyers to appear to get assistance while actually building up a deferred debt&mdash;this sounds a bit like students! This quickly landed a number of them in trouble when house values declined and their total debt mounted. They found that if they sold their house and tried to get out, they owed Homeswest between $15,000 and $20,000. I understand other states had similar problems and in most cases debt was written off. Low income people were allowed to escape from this diabolical scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I feel that offering choice in this context often comes down to three options&mdash;you can go on the rental waiting list and wait seven years, you can go on the purchase waiting list under the scheme and wait five years or you can go on key&hyphen;start. If you are about to graduate from uni and have a job waiting, you can get a house in six to nine months. To me that is not a choice; it is a system that discriminates and differentiates on the basis of income or probable future income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It often comes down to no choice at all. Some people have to struggle on, while the funding is given to those who are nearly able to afford to buy a house under normal conditions. I believe a requirement to ensure choice may be seen as a requirement to ensure that there are various programs functionally accessible to each client. It is in this sense that I wish to amend the bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA>Amendment No. 6 was designed to ensure that the preamble includes a fairly specific reference to choice of where to live. It is designed to assure that there is housing available in most areas and not just in the fringe areas or welfare ghettoes. It is also designed to indicate that choice should be offered between different types of housing, including flats, separate houses, community housing and so on. It should not be, `You can live in these state housing blocks or else you can have a house out in Woop Woop.' There should be diversity of housing. It should be available in most areas. This was something the better cities program had begun to implement with a bit of diversity in public housing planned for inner city areas like East Perth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Basically, what we are saying here is that it is important that there is choice.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to praise the previous housing minister in Western Australia, Jim McGinty. I must say that there is not a lot I used to praise Jim McGinty for. But to give credit where credit is due, he did make a real effort to make sure that there was funded public housing in areas like Fremantle and East Perth, areas which have good accessibility to public transport services, hospitals and so on. This housing was designed in ways that people could look at it and say, `That is good use of the land. There is good space built into there. They are not just dog boxes and they are actually built with people in mind.' I think we can do that. Often it does not cost more to design things well and I think those choices should be available.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA>This is an amendment to reinstate reference to the design, planning and management of cities and towns role of local governing bodies. These words were in the original version of the Housing Assistance Bill when it was introduced by the former Labor government in the last session of parliament. When this bill was considered in the House of Representatives, the government refused to reinstate these words.

We agree that cooperation is desirable. This is essentially legislation drafted by the previous Labor administration, and we accept that cooperation is necessary.

The policy says that a future coalition government will commit all Commonwealth projects and departments to achieving high quality design standards for urban and regional planning design; will formulate quality guidelines for Commonwealth funded projects which ensure measurable community benefit; and, will work with the states, territories and local governments, together with the various interested professional organisations, to advance and assess the results of urban and regional design.</PARA>

We are already cognisant of the fact that funding was to decline and that we still have massive public housing waiting lists&mdash;around 235,000 people&mdash;yet still the coalition, with its raft of promises on public housing at the last election campaign, is not prepared to give a commitment that funding will not be cut.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I went through the coalition's policy document also, Senator Newman. It is probably not necessary to remind you of your funding commitments or your commitments to public housing, suffice to say that you foreshadowed no cuts to public housing in your election promises. If your government intends to keep its commitment to housing policy&mdash;that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1731"> includes commitments to the supported accommodation assistance program, maintaining the community housing program and improving Aboriginal housing, et cetera; I could go on&mdash;I do not see how you could possibly oppose the amendment before the chamber today, unless, of course, you intend to raise the amount of money that you will be spending on public housing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government opposes the amendment before the Senate today, you will be signalling an intention to break your election promises in the area of public housing, and that for the Treasurer (Mr Costello) perhaps face saving and the mythical black hole are more important than those 235,000 Australians on public housing waiting lists. The Democrats strongly support the request before the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I wonder whether she will. The difficulty is that the parties on the Left, if you like, certainly the parties of the opposition, seem to regard it as mysterious that there is only one year's appropriation of funds in this bill. It is not mysterious. It was very deliberate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason is that we have supported the action which the previous government had been taking in trying to achieve housing reform. We came into government after this had been an agreed position between the state and federal governments for some time. We looked at what had to be done and asked: <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> why should we delay this, or allow for delay, if it can possibly be moved along? We are not trying to introduce change that has not properly been considered by all parties. We are not trying to stampede people. We are certainly trying to send a signal that we mean serious business, that the reform process which was started by the previous government is a commitment of this government. And we do not want delay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does not mean that we do not believe that there has got to be transitional arrangements. But we do not want to send the message that we want to be in the same position in three years time as the one we are in now. So we have said that this is the funding for this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the communique, which the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Faulkner) has referred to, we have recognised the long lead times for capital funding and the problems of the carryover of funds. We have said that we will give a more detailed statement to the states in August. They will have a better understanding of our proposals when they receive that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The funding for subsequent years will be by way of annual appropriation. It will be influenced by the stage which the negotiations have reached. We are not going to be providing one sort of funding for one type of housing commitment if a different stage in the negotiation process is reached.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me not be misunderstood on this. We are committed to continuing funding for housing. What we are intending to do, as the former government was intending to do, is change the split in who did what. There is nothing mysterious about it. We think it is inappropriate at this stage to be putting funding down on the table for second and third years when we are not yet further along the negotiation process. We are going to provide transitional funding. We will be giving early advice&mdash;after all, 10 months ahead of the next financial year is pretty early&mdash;to the states about how we see that transitional funding being arranged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that it is fair to all parties, including the federal taxpayer. I certainly hope that it achieves the intention of making sure that this process does not get stalled, that it keeps <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1732"> moving along. That is why the government has proposed an agreement for up to three years and has nominated funding for the first year under that agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am concerned that the Australian Labor Party would endanger this legislation. I thank Senator Faulkner for his commitment to dealing with it on its return from the House of Representatives, but I am not sure whether he is alert to some of the facts. This bill having appropriated money for the first year, further funding was not provided for when the supply bills recently came before the parliament; consequently, if this bill is not passed by 30 June, the Commonwealth will not be able to make such payments until appropriation bill No. 2 for 1996-97 has been passed. That could delay payments to the states by five to six months. It could be expected to have a significant impact on negotiations with the states on longer term housing reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are the facts of the matter. I urge you to think very carefully about that. If you are trying to achieve having appropriations for the second and third years included in this bill, on the grounds that that is going to help the states with certainty and an understanding of where they are going, you are actually potentially putting them at much greater risk by leaving them with cash shortages in the first five or six months of the next financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am giving you the advice that I have given you. I can only hope that, as the former government that was committed to this reform, you would not want to endanger the position of the states in this way. Nevertheless, the government will not be supporting this request.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a point of clarification, I thought I would make a few comments on the minister's mention of the reform process and just place on the record what process should not be delayed. There is a definite agenda, and the government has made some changes to this bill with the intention of shifting the provision of public housing from the public sector to the private sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister is right in saying this was a process which began with the previous government. To some measure, one shift is to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> lease private sector dwellings which are then rented to tenants. In our opinion that is inefficient since it means the benefit does not ultimately accrue to the public. It seems more sensible for government to purchase a house outright than pay rent on it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Basically, that is the process. It is a process at odds with what the Industry Commission recommended&mdash;that is, more funding be available for decent public housing&mdash;and is actually shifting public housing on to private housing. That is what we were getting at with amendment No. 11. Basically, we think that part of it should be a commitment to new housing stock. That does not seem to be the case and, unfortunately, the amendment was not supported.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is basically the `reform' process that is shifting the emphasis onto the private agenda. Quite frankly, that is probably why there is no connection with the ability to pay. Once you do that it is almost taken out of your hands because it becomes totally market oriented. I am very sorry to see that that is considered to be the reform process we are dealing with.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second thing that I believe will come from this reform process is a reduction in the queues for public housing because people will not be economically conscripted into public housing. Many people would like to live near where they can work, near where they have family support, in an area where there is better transport or in an area that is removed somewhat from the drug culture for their children.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a debate on the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996. I note that it is usual for a bill to be first presented to the House of Representatives before it comes to the Senate. There is in the second reading speech and explanatory memorandum no explanation as to why this bill is starting its passage through this parliament in the Senate, but I am sure that, in his reply, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Senator Kemp) might wish to comment on that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is substantially the same as a bill presented by the then Labor government in November last year, a bill which modified the arrangements for the export market development grant and which emanated from the 1995&hyphen;96 budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before arriving in this chamber, the bill was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. Just under a fortnight ago&mdash;in fact, last Wednesday week&mdash;that committee held an inquiry. A large number of industry organisations attended at relatively short notice to present comprehensive submissions, not only on this bill and the clauses it contains, but also&mdash;I am <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sure they would not mind me saying this&mdash;to put a clear and firm stake in the ground.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They wanted to indicate that if, as rumours emanating from the ERC suggest, this scheme were to be abolished or severely hobbled, they, as organisations representing Australian industry, would be absolutely opposed to that step. They wanted to mark their opposition in advance of the government's consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee's report was tabled today. The committee was unable to agree. I filed a minority report which, I think, more accurately reflects the views of industry than does the government achieved majority report. However, I will come to that in a moment. There is some background to the EMDG scheme that it is necessary to give first.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a scheme that is administered by Austrade, and, I might say, by and large, administered very well by that organisation. It was introduced by the Whitlam Labor government in 1974. Its purpose was to encourage Australian businesses to seek out new export markets for Australian goods and services. I might add, in parenthesis, it has been spectacularly successful at doing that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The scheme itself currently provides taxable cash grants of up to $250,000 per annum based on the expenditure incurred by an Australian person or company seeking to create or expand exports of their products in overseas markets. Provided a person has incurred at least $30,000 of eligible expenditure in one year, they will be entitled to a grant. The grant is calculated at 50 per cent of eligible expenditure after the first $15,000. Claimants can receive up to eight grants and are subject to a performance test after two grants. Eligible expenditure includes up&hyphen;front marketing costs such as travel expenses, special promotional literature and overseas representations. Companies who record export sales above $25 million per year are ineligible to apply for the grant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Between the years 1974 to 1991, 69,234 grants were made. Most EMDG grants are approximately $65,000 in value. In 1994-95, approximately 3,400 exporters received a total of $211 million under the scheme. Projections made in 1995 suggest that the scheme will <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1735"> grow to around $292 million by the year 1998-99.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth noting as well that some 70 per cent of all EMDG recipients are small and medium exporters with 25 or fewer employees. The last note in explanation is that, in 1994, as part of Working Nation, the Labor government announced the extension of the scheme for a further five years, thereby ultimately providing assistance to an expected 5,000 exporters per year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is, as I have said, a scheme that has been in existence for some time and it works very well. It works very well for a host of reasons, the most outstanding one being that the scheme is a very cost&hyphen;effective use of government expenditure. The scheme itself has been regularly reviewed. This is not a scheme that has gone on without its pulse being taken from time to time. The most recent review was in 1993 when the Treasury, the Department of Finance, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Price Waterhouse, with the assistance of Professor Bewley, an econometrist from the University of New South Wales, conducted a far&hyphen;reaching review of the scheme. It has also been reviewed by the Industry Commission and by a series of other bodies as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All, in substance, have agreed that this is an effective scheme. I might say that that is a rare conclusion when you consider that the key policy departments that conducted the review&mdash;the departments colloquially referred to as the bean counter departments, Finance and Treasury, who apply hard eyed rationalist thought and scrutiny to the effects of schemes such as this which use a large amount of public money&mdash;could not find fault with it at the end of the day. They gave it a tick, and in the stilted prose and understated commentary of Treasury, you would say that they, in fact, lauded the effectiveness of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first point&mdash;the most significant point&mdash;is that it is cost effective. It has been through the mill; no fault can be found with it, and it has been given a tick.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two other important things that I should say about it. Firstly, the amount of export that this expenditure of public monies creates is something that the committee that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reviewed this bill paid some attention to, and their comments are found, most importantly, on paragraph 46 of their report. They found that, for every dollar expended, the advantage returned to Australia was many times the amount outlaid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The multiplier, as this is referred to, was found by the inquiry to be somewhere between 15 and 25 times. That is to say, for every dollar outlaid in the scheme, $15 to $25 in exports are achieved. Professor Bewley, who reviewed this as an econometrist, put the multiplier at about 10 times, but sometimes for more experienced firms it goes up to 25 times. It is worth noting as well that the Australian Information Industries Association reported, after surveying their own membership to see what the behaviour of the scheme was, that for experienced members&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>In so doing, I draw the attention of the Senate to not only the change of practice of this government&mdash;which is to table for the scrutiny of parliament and the new joint committee on treaties all treaties and exchanges of notes that are relevant to treaties; in this case, it is an exchange of notes which amend an agreement between Australia and Singapore&mdash;but also the significant commitment that this government has to the Shoalwater Bay training area and to good cooperation with our neighbours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the benefit of honourable senators I should outline the basis of the document currently before the Senate. It is a document to amend a treaty between Australia and Singapore, which was made in February last year, to allow the Singaporean defence forces to use the Shoalwater Bay training area for armoured and infantry exercises rather than <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1736"> the original proposals that were contained in the agreement of 17 February.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a sign that this government is sincere about parliamentary accountability that these notes were exchanged on 14 June this year and were tabled just four days later. I think the government deserves congratulations for the promptness with which it is bringing these matters to the attention of the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More importantly, what this agreement does is ensure very good cooperation with one of our close neighbours who is also a leading member of ASEAN. What Australia needs to do is have a meaningful relationship with our ASEAN neighbours. One of the failings of the previous government was that they almost went out of their way to insult and upset our neighbours. This government has a different view. We are not going to go kowtowing to anybody, but we do believe that you should have good relations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other important thing is that this agreement is a step towards the full utilisation of the Shoalwater Bay training facility. That is very important for the regional economy of Central Queensland, because full utilisation of that facility means more money will be flowing from outside the region into the local economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can say, as somebody who was in Central Queensland and Rockhampton the week before last, that there is an enormous desire there to see every possible job created that this government can achieve. That must mean that we have to bring more and more income into the area. Use of these facilities means more people are going through the region; it means more people are going through the airport; it means more people are using the port facilities; it means, ultimately, a flow-on to the whole of the local economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government will continue to improve the development of the economy of Central Queensland. I know that my colleague in the other place, Mr Marek, the member for Capricornia, is absolutely committed to finding every possible form of investment and every possible form of outside income to the economy of Central Queensland. He believes, as I do, that it is through the development of rural and regional Australia that we achieve <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this nation's potential. That means that places like Rockhampton, as well as other places along the Queensland coast, deserve the consideration and respect of the government. That is what they are going to get from the coalition and that is what they are getting here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More importantly, by ensuring that this facility is well used, we make it more feasible and more viable for the Australian Defence Force to keep using it. We reduce our share of the operating costs, and that is in the best interests of Australian taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I am very pleased to see that the document has been tabled. Without pre-empting the decisions of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I think it is a very fine document. I think the government should be congratulated not only for its strategic foresight but also for the promptness with which it has managed to table this document in the Senate&mdash;just four days after the exchange of notes.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>I am speaking today to the Industry Commission's report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Competitive tendering and contracting by public sector agencies</EMPHASIS> . On my brief scanning of a very large document, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1737"> it seems that there are some issues of concern, and some of these involve the concerns that the Greens have mentioned on a number of occasions; that is, the impact of competition policy and how it actually impacts across the board. I am afraid that the end approach&mdash;whatever you do and however you try to write your tendering document&mdash;tends to be reductionist. Some of the real costs of the outcomes of lowest cost tender&hyphen;type approaches are never met by the people who put out the tender, and they are certainly not met by the people who are offered the tender.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that during the competition policy legislation debate there was resistance from both sides of the chamber to placing any connection between policy goals from other areas into the competition policy legislation. So, if we are not careful, by 1998 we will basically fall into a situation where competition policy rules are okay but the other areas that may figure into the real costs of many of these decisions will not be taken into consideration. Other people, often the community, will be required to pick up the pieces. For instance, a recommendation in the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If local governments in rural or remote areas give preferences to local suppliers or require contractors to use local resources, that should be set down fully in the tender documentation; all tenders, including in-house bids, should identify separately the additional price for being required to use local resources; and when the contract is awarded, any additional cost due to a requirement to use local resources should be announced.</PARA>
<PARA>That is interesting but, basically, some of the costs are not dollar costs; they could be environmental costs. For instance, I often use the example of frozen meals for hospitals which are transported from the city to the regions. It may well be that they are cheaper, but what is the real cost? It is not necessarily a dollar cost. What is the real cost to the person at the other end&mdash;the patient&mdash;who cannot order their meal a week in advance so that it gets there by road in a refrigerated truck? What is the real cost in employment opportunities to the local area? How do you actually build that into your tendering process? If you say that the onus is on the local regional council to make sure that they have <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> calculated the cost, how do you then provide them with the resources to do that? What do you mean by the real costs there? They are some of the examples.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have also noticed that in this document there is some information in box No. 2 `The impact of CTC on quality'. A lot of the issues actually talk about price. Quite frankly, I could find you at least as many where the impact of implementing competitive tendering has actually indicated a decrease in quality. All you have to do is look at where these kinds of policies have been implemented in other parts of the world to come up with as many or more examples of serious shortfalls in quality and a lack of public control over what used to be publicly provided services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a great many pitfalls I believe we can fall into by accepting this kind of document. I believe it is time that we start looking at the real implications of what we have signed up to under the competition policy legislation of July last year and start looking at the wide implications, instead of this reductionist approach that somehow or other saving the dollars tender by tender actually means that you have saved money for society. I do not think that is the case. I have yet to see a situation where the real costs of many of these decisions can actually be figured in. Quite frankly, our efforts to include those to be considered in what is public interest, and so on, were not adequately dealt with when this legislation was dealt with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to go back to the legislation and look at more bodies, other than just the Industry Commission, and start looking at the real impacts of competitive tendering. How, for instance, do you make sure that the real hours required on a job are included in a tender? How do you do that adequately and then make sure that somebody else is not left with a price when the tender has been underquoted? Many people end up paying for that. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</PARA>

<ROLE>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Family Services)</ROLE>
<TIME.STAMP>(7.02 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the election in March the Liberal and National Party coalition won an overwhelming mandate for a number of their policies&mdash;policies which were very clearly articulated to the electorate prior to the election. The overwhelming mandate was such that in the House of Representatives we finished with 94 seats compared with the Labor Party's miserable 49 seats. We received 54 per cent of the vote in that chamber. In the Senate we increased our representation by the maximum amount possible by winning the extra seat in New South Wales. We did this on the basis of clearly articulated policies, particularly relating to the environment, Telstra, industrial relations and tax reform.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We seem to have had problems in the Senate in terms of the blocking of some of these issues by the Democrats. The Leader of the Democrats, Senator Kernot, claims a mandate to oppose the partial privatisation of Telstra, for example. There is a fundamental flaw in the claim that the increased vote in the Senate for the Democrats gives that party a mandate to oppose that partial privatisation because she conveniently avoids indicating that the Labor Party, the main opponent of the Telstra sale, registered a huge voting decline in the Senate throughout Australia. Both in negative percentage swings and in actual voting losses, the decline in support for the ALP in the Senate far outweighed the Democrat gains which were largely, if not totally, a recovery from the very poor Democrat polling in 1993 when Senator Coulter was the leader of the party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If voters, particularly those who swung to the coalition so massively in the House of Representatives, had wished to indicate opposition to the Telstra sale, they had alternatives in the Senate, that is, to reduce the coalition vote, to increase the Labor vote or to increase Democrat support. None of these <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> opportunities was availed of. The coalition Senate vote increased significantly; the Labor vote declined dramatically; and the Democrat vote really did nothing more than recover from its disastrous results in 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of actual votes, the relatively small Democrat gains were engulfed by huge ALP losses and, in contrast, the coalition vote increased&mdash;an endorsement of its very clearly stated policies. We gained an extra seat in New South Wales&mdash;the only state in which such an opportunity occurred&mdash;and a further reinforcement of the electoral mandate. In the new Senate the coalition will hold 37 of the 76 seats and the ALP 29. That is a clear enough indication in itself as to which party should have that mandate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The slogan that the Democrats ran on was the `Keep the bastards honest' policy. By any interpretation, keep the bastards honest means keep them to their word, hold them to the policies they clearly articulated. The obligation of the Democrats clearly is to ensure that promises are implemented, not to block their implementation. Even Don Chipp, the founder of the Democrats, said that this had to happen for the good of the nation. He also said that the Democrat party had no right whatsoever to oppose the government's agenda for reform. Mr Chipp went on to say that this was the appropriate response. Senator Kernot's staggering reply to that was to say that an analysis of the election result was proof that the Democrats were wanted by the voters to be an insurance policy in the Senate!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Kernot's idea of insurance is strangely skewed. According to Senator Kernot, the 11 per cent of voters who voted for the Democrats gives them a right to ensure that what 48 per cent of people voted for, and what more than 50 per cent of people consistently support in the polls now, should be opposed altogether. I would hate to buy insurance from Senator Kernot. If she thinks that their scraping together 11 per cent of the vote means that Australians as a whole are asking her for insurance in the form of complete obstruction of the government's agenda, then she had better not go into the insurance business.  </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1739">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are the arguments on Telstra that we hear? None of them is in the form of substantiation of claims by the Democrats. We have an ideological position and little more. The evidence from all over the world is that the benefits of privatisation, particularly for telecommunications services, are enormous. The Democrats make vague claims about the possibility of reduced services or increased charges, but the regulations that we have put into this bill actually offer much better protection to consumers than they have at present. There are penalties. For example, if you have to wait beyond the allotted date for an installation of a telephone, there are financial penalties on Telstra. Telstra's own estimates are that they are 30 per cent off the pace in terms of world leaders in telecommunication networks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The benefits of competition are demonstrated all over the world&mdash;especially in the US and in Europe. What we have here from the Democrats is very clearly just an ideological stance and, make no bones about it, it is a hard left wing stance. Any pretensions the Democrats used to have to being a middle of the road party are gone. They are socialists through and through. We in this chamber actually thought socialism was dead. Some of our leaders in the coalition did say that socialist was not a way of describing the Labor Party. That may be true for the bulk of the Labor Party but it is certainly not true for the Democrats. The Democrats are now a socialist party now. They were described the other day as the watermelon party&mdash;green on the outside and red in the middle. It seems to be very appropriate. The description of them by one of my colleagues as Laborcrats not Democrats is also entirely appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at what the situation is in terms of privatisation around the world. Let me quote David Walker, who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You can pick the exact day when telecommunications privatisations slipped from the list of great global ideological controversies. On Monday, 13 June 1994 Fidel Castro agreed to sell half of its Cuban telecommunications system to a Mexican firm. When Castro, the last governing hero of deep red socialism, did that, the question of who should own the phone company lost its philosophical sting. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> The debate everywhere is dissolving into consensus.</PARA>
<PARA>The combined Australian Left, led by the Australian Democrats and the Greens and followed by Labor, has not quite caught up even with Fidel Castro. They still want to block the bid but their arguments become more dated with every passing month.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As if that was not bad enough, as if that was not extreme enough, not only does Fidel Castro, the leader of the Left in the world, think this but so do the Albanians. The Albanians are now privatising part of their Telecom network. Even South Africa is moving to sell off some 25 per cent of its network. All around the world people are realising the benefits of privatisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats oppose the partial privatisation. They oppose the industrial relations bill. They oppose the sales tax changes. They oppose this and they oppose that. But for Senator Kernot it is not just words. She does put her money where her mouth is. In 17 divisions in this place since the election, the Democrats have opposed us in 16. The coalition government has lost 15 of these 17, I might add.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only support we had from the Democrats was when there was a question of what should constitute a quorum on a joint committee appointment. That is not exactly one of the major issues facing the country but that is the only issue in 17 votes in this place on which the Democrats have in any way supported the government. Let them not pretend to be trying to uphold the mantle of democracy or freedom. This is blind ideology. It is blind obstructionism. It is opposition and blocking for its own sake. It cannot be called responsible. Senator Kernot seems to be giddy with the power that she now has but fortunately she is now losing her credibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt at all in our minds that this is the true left wing party of Australia&mdash;the opportunists. When I first came into this place the Democrats were described to me as the `fairies at the bottom of the garden' party. I was sceptical of that description but, having seen them in action for a couple of years, and in particular in the last month or two, there is no doubt in my mind that that is a very fair description.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1740">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are responsible not for keeping us, the government, honest but for trying to keep us dishonest, for opposing one of the largest mandates in history. The sadness is that Australia loses. The environment will lose because of the blocking of the environment legislation funding package. Telstra consumers will lose. In fact, everybody will lose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is time for the Democrats to come clean and abandon any pretence whatsoever to being the middle of the road party in Australia, to abandon any pretence to protecting the environment&mdash;they are vandalising the environment because of what they are blocking&mdash;and indeed to abandon any pretence to being Democrats in the sense of being representative of democracy. It is time they came clean and proclaimed themselves as the Laborcrat party&mdash;the socialist party of Australia.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<TIME.STAMP>(7.12 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to put on record my respect for and my sorrow at the passing of David Parker. David Parker AM, who has been a close friend of mine for the last 10 years or so, would certainly be very well-known to all residents of Canberra for his role not only in creating and sustaining the Canberra City Opera but also for the outstanding job he did as the head of the school of singing at the Canberra School of Music&mdash;a position he occupied from 1976 until a couple of years ago when he very reluctantly, I might say, retired and went to live in Cairns. He died at the weekend of a massive heart attack.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">His obituary by Mr Hoffmann is in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>. But there are many other things that I would like to say about David Parker in addition to that obituary, which naturally deals very much with his outstanding role in Canberra. I must say I enjoyed not only watching his wonderful contribution to music education in this city but also seeing his involvement in bringing opera to as many people as possible in Canberra at a time when there were very great difficulties in doing so. I think opera ACT was having difficulties and it was very difficult for people in Canberra to hear much local quality operatic music.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly one of the great thrills of my life was to appear with him in the Canberra City Opera's production a few years ago of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Trial by Jury</EMPHASIS> when I was shadow minister for the arts. I guess I put my mouth where my shadow portfolio was and sang with him in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Trial by Jury</EMPHASIS> in the Great Hall of the parliamentrliament. David Parker sang the tenor role of the defendant and I was the judge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was not only a wonderfully accomplished singer but, in general terms, a great contributor to music and music education in Australia. His enthusiasm was not simply that of a teacher but, as I said, he provided easy access to opera and singing to whatever community he happened to live in. Canberra received the benefit of that for many years. In fact, I think it was in 1976 or so when he came to the Canberra School of Music, having first come to Australia on New Years Day in 1969. He had 27&hyphen;odd years in Australia, having had a distinguished singing career before that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was brought to Australia by the Australian Opera to be a principal tenor. Having had, I think, two seasons as principal tenor, he then became a touring artist with the ABC in Australia and New Zealand and sang with almost all the state operas&mdash;certainly Queensland, Victoria, Western Australia and Tasmania&mdash;and distinguished himself in all those areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He sang in not only opera but also many other things. He sang with all the Australian orchestras. It is fascinating to see the list of people he sang with: the Welsh opera; the English National Opera, which was formerly Sadler's Wells; the Carl Rosa Opera; and touring companies in Ireland and in India, where he toured five times. He also was renowned for his roles in the great oratorios and masses, such as Britten's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">War Requiem</EMPHASIS> and Berlioz's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Grand Mass for the Dead.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The distinguished artists he has sung with include Kiri Te Kanawa in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Damnation of Faust</EMPHASIS>. I understand that he got better notices than she did on that occasion. He also sang with the wonderful late Australian singer Marie Collier and with Geraint Evans, Dame Gwyneth Jones and Simon Estes. He sang <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1741"> under the batons of such outstanding conductors as Sir Thomas Beecham, Sir Adrian Boult and Van Otterloo.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps more significant has been the remarkable achievements of some of his students. I guess as a teacher of singing that would be the measure he would like to be judged against. Probably most outstanding at the moment in Australian terms would be Graham Pushee, who so recently showed us almost a new dimension in singing in the Australian Opera's production of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Julius Caesar</EMPHASIS>. Among his other achievements were being principal tenor at the Wexford international festival in Ireland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He had an infectious, incredible sense of energy, fun and enthusiasm. This enthusiasm led him on many occasions, particularly when I was shadow minister for the arts, to give me the benefit of his advice, whether I sought it or not. He was a very determined person. I must admit that I found my ear being bashed in a very friendly but very determined way. David Parker had a clear view of what he thought we should be doing. It was always to be in Australia's best interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was born in Wales. You could certainly tell that from the first words he uttered. He was very Welsh&mdash;very emotional, very excitable, very decent, very loving. He was married for 27 years to his widow, Marie van Hove, who herself played a distinguished role in the Canberra School of Music and before that was the ABC's most accomplished accompanist. I know that the musical partnership that existed through those years was a very intense and incredibly satisfying one to both of them. It is extraordinary that, in view of the way they had worked so hard together, David had been saying the six months of his retirement in Cairns, before unfortunately having this heart attack, were the most exciting and wonderful in his life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It had been such an incredibly full life. Having been born in Skewen, near Cardiff in south Wales, in 1927 he had an outstanding education in music. He was a Seguin scholar at the Royal Academy of Music before going on to so many outstanding achievements in opera around the world. He leaves, apart from <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Marie van Hove, his widow, three daughters by an earlier marriage: twins Nora and Rina, and Susan, all of whom live in the United Kingdom but are coming back for his funeral on Saturday, which will be in Cairns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All I can say in conclusion is that there are very few people who have left such an incredible impact on me as David Parker did. As I said, his bubbling enthusiasm sometimes carried him&mdash;some people might say&mdash;over the edge in presenting his case. Certainly some people in Canberra resented his determination to do things in what he believed to be the right way. In my view, his heart was always in the right place, even though it was his heart that ultimately let him down. His enthusiasm for Australia was outstanding. His love of music was overwhelming. He will be sadly missed.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Only assets used in carrying out primary production and the liabilities directly related to carrying out those activities are taken into account. This means that if a person's home is on farmland used for primary production activities, only the farmland is included with other farming assets in the total primary production assets held; if the farm, including the home, is encumbered, only the portion of the liability related to primary production activities is included with other primary production liabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The department did not agree with the Social Security Appeals Tribunal's interpretation of section 1121A in the Little case. Amendments to the legislation were contemplated to put the matter beyond doubt but they were not pursued because of legal advice that the existing legislation was clear, and that the department's administration of the provision was correct.</PARA>

For example Skin Diver, December 1992, states on page 167 that `National scuba training/certification agencies such as PAD, SSI, NAUI, PDIC and YMCA will not touch nitrox training and certification'. In addition, the president of the South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society (SPUMS) wrote in that society's journal of Jan&hyphen;Mar 1992 "SPUMS policy on `high tech' recreational diving is that it should be actively discouraged".</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(15)(a) The personnel involved in the earlier discussions are not readily available for questioning. One is now deceased.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) The reason for the close timing of the meeting and its approval document is not recorded. It is assessed that due to constraints on the availability of personnel to attend the meeting a tentative time was set subject to higher authority approval. This approval was forthcoming.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) This question should be referred to NSW WorkCover or NSW Department of Health. Flag Officer Naval Support Command approved discussions with WorkCover and these took place.</PARA>

The unsubstantiated details were not reported as fact to WorkCover. They were reported with the statement that if they were correct then such a diver would involve risk of injury beyond that normally experienced by recreational divers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(17) Information received by the RAN about a proposed dive by Mr Cason raised the issue of mixed gas semi&hyphen;closed circuit recreational diving in Australia. The advice to WorkCover was in relation to this type of diving and not simply a proposed dive by Mr Cason.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(18) As already stated, there was a buoyancy miscalculation in the advice provided to WorkCover. However, this did not alter the RAN's conclusion regarding the specialist equipment, procedures, training and the support required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(19) The allegation that the RAN had no idea of the developments in mixed gas diving since at least the mid&hyphen;1980s, is entirely refuted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(20) No, there was no professionally incompetent information provided to NSW WorkCover or other New South Wales and Queensland government departments.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)(a) &amp; (b) It is not possible to provide the specific information requested by the honourable senator, as that information is not kept by the ATO. Legal action to recover a debt, which may ultimately result in the sequestration of an individual debtor's estate in bankruptcy or the liquidation of a corporate debtor, is commenced in quite a number of cases. However, that action may not always be pursued to its ultimate conclusion because the debtor may pay in full or may enter into an acceptable arrangement to pay a debt over time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In some cases, debtors present their own petition for bankruptcy. There are also cases where other creditors of the ATO debtor may initiate legal recovery action and pursue a debt to bankruptcy or liquidation (the ATO will figure as a creditor in a majority of bankruptcy/liquidation cases given the nature of taxation and its application to the majority of Australians). In those cases, the ATO will either lodge a proof of debt with the official receiver, a trustee in bankruptcy or a liquidator or will ask the Court to be substituted as the petitioning creditor in appropriate instances.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Transport and Regional Development has provided  <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1751"> the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) and (2) A timetable for the development of Sydney's second airport will be prepared in light of the Government's review of the outcome of the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) process for the new airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has decided to expand the EIS to encompass an updated environmental assessment of Holsworthy, as well as Badgerys Creek, as a possible site for Sydney's second major airport. Should the environmental impacts of developing a major airport at Badgerys Creek prove to be unacceptable, it is important that an alternative site has been considered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Preparation for the EIS process for the new airport has already commenced. The Department of Transport and Regional Development recently advertised for organisations interested in providing consultancy services for various aspects of the EIS. The extent of future EIS related contracts will be determined once the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency has finalised the guidelines for the EIS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The properties comprising the Sydney West Airport site at Badgerys Creek have all been acquired by the Commonwealth. The Holsworthy site is also already owned by the Commonwealth. This ensures minimum delay in the commencement of construction once the EIS process is finalised and the consequential Government decisions have been made.</PARA></ANSWER></ANSWER.TO.QON></ANSWERS.TO.QUESTIONS></HANSARD>
