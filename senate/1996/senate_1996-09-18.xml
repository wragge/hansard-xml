<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Assistant Treasurer in respect of the administrative complexities of the government's new 15 per cent superannuation tax. Are you aware of the trenchant criticisms of: Professor David Knox, former Liberal superannuation adviser and currently member of the government's actuarial advisory committee; Mr Bruce Cook, chairman of William M. Mercer; Mr Brian Bissacker of Bankers Trust; Mr Emery Feyzeny of KPMG and your own Liberal Senate colleague Senator John Watson on the superannuation tax? When will you acknowledge the broad community concerns on this issue? Will you support referral to the Senate committee on superannuation with a report back date by 30 November?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The one thing that this question shows, quite clearly, is that the opposition is not prepared to join the government in seeking a fairer superannuation system for all Australians. That is the nub of what this question is all about. Is the Australian Labor Party really fair dinkum about supporting the surcharge that we have imposed in the budget? Mr Beazley says one thing and Senator Sherry says another thing. Someone says, `We will refer it to a committee.' Others say, `We do not need to do so&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Labor took the same starting point as us in wanting greater fairness and, therefore, really supporting the surcharge that we have proposed in the budget&mdash;which Senator Sherry, I think, and Mr Beazley have said they do support&mdash;then it would be logical to wait until the legislation is introduced into the parliament after the extensive consultations that are going on at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Senator Sherry well knows that an actuarial advisory committee is looking at these issues in relation to defined benefit funds and unfunded schemes. He knows that the government has established a task force which comprises representatives of the ISC, the ATO, Treasury and industry to look at these issues. He knows that extensive consultations are going on, including the involvement of Professor David Knox, and we are very pleased that he is doing that; he is approach ing it in a very constructive way. Consultations are going on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The logical, systematic, due process way to proceed with this would be to let those consultations proceed and, as a result, have the legislation drafted and presented to parliament. Then the parliament, through its committee systems, can have every opportunity to look at the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, quite frankly, it is absolutely ridiculous to say before that legislation is drafted, before the consultations have concluded&mdash;we are only halfway through the consultations&mdash;`Let's go and look at all the fine detail of this issue' before you have the detail to consider.

What we are saying&mdash;and we are really prejudging the debate that is to come up a little later&mdash;is that until the consultations have taken place, until legislation has been drafted and brought into this parliament so one can see the details, then it is premature to refer such a matter of administration to a committee.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VW4">Senator HERRON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Senator Ellison, for that question. The government has taken the view that, after complete bungling and incompetence by the previous government, this matter has gone on for long enough. The sad fact is that we have had four state and federal inquiries costing in excess of $3 million, the latest by Justice Jane Mathews costing over $1 million. In addition, it is estimated that well over $1 million has been spent on associated legal appeals and actions <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3547"> in various courts.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, there are many examples. United Telecommunications, for example, which aims to be Australia's largest Telstra Mobilenet service provider, currently has a national operations centre with some 200 staff.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Quite right. I am equally impressed by the fact that you are impressed too. It plans to expand that to 40 such systems by the end of next year. It has also introduced satellite TV coverage across regional New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and South Australia. This has meant 600 new jobs throughout regional Australia, with another 200 people to be employed before the end of this year. In these two companies alone, we have more than 1,000 new jobs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The high level of employment growth in the private telecommunications sector is reflected in the overall figures. The Telecommunications Industry Development Authority has published figures which show that the number of employees in the equipment suppliers and service provider sector of the industry alone has increased by just short of 20,000 in the two years from December 1993. That is up 30 per cent. Employment growth in the communications sector overall is phenomenal&mdash;35,000 new jobs since 1993. Of course, during that period Telstra was downsizing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra's own activities in cable roll&hyphen;out and service expansion are also creating new jobs and new businesses across Australia. Some 1,200 jobs were created in Queensland alone during 1994&hyphen;95. These examples are only a taste of what is to come. Paynet Telecommunications plans to roll out cable in Cairns and, hopefully, Townsville. Neighbourhood Cable plans to offer video on demand and other services to a regional community south&hyphen;east of Melbourne. Northgate Communications proposes to install a network in the Ballarat area offering pay TV and other services. Austar is apparently interested in Tasmania, although at this time East Coast Television has the regional rights.</PARA>

In Brazil for many years, because of the absence of fossil fuels, the subsidies were given to ethanol and something like 98 per cent of all new motorcars were made to go on ethanol.

One was CSR, which had been making ethanol at Sarina, south of Mackay, since 1927. The other one was at Manildra, where ethanol is produced as a by-product from the production of gluten from wheat. The effect of this was that from all aspects&mdash;from an environmental perspective, from a cost perspective and from many other perspectives&mdash;it could not continue to be justified.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What was the level of the subsidy? The cost of producing ethanol was 70c per litre. The cost of producing petrol is 23c per litre.

It was clearly obvious that the industry could not stand on its own feet and the continuance of the bounty could not be justified under any circumstances. A study was done by the Bureau of Resource Sciences, ABARE and the department. The net outcome of that study was to not continue the ethanol bounty scheme.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Obviously the Labor Party are not interested in this. The whole two&hyphen;mine policy is embarrassing to them, but they should at least be interested in the radiation levels that apply to workers and to people who visit the mine. Currently the international level is 50 millisieverts, which is going to reduce to 20 over the next five years. The average level at Ranger is five millisieverts in open working areas and one millisievert in office areas. Caution, of course, must always be exercised with exit rays of radioactive materials. It is an area that I spent ten years of my working life in. Let me say that X&hyphen;rays and radioactive materials have been a great benefit to the community at large. There are some 55 staff of the Office of the Supervising Scientist and 30 ERA staff involved in radiation and environmental monitoring at Ranger.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Visitors to Ranger face no potential hazard from radiation exposure. The total radiation exposure to members of the Senate select committee on uranium during their visit to Ranger was two to five microsieverts. Of the four members of the committee, all except one were briefed at the site. Where was Senator Margetts, the most vocal anti&hyphen;uranium advocate in the Senate? She, with the rest of the committee flew all the way to Darwin, then from Darwin to Ranger and then all the way back again and would not get out of the bus. To use her own words, as reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Northern Territory News</EMPHASIS>, she felt more comfortable in the vehicle. She is reported to have said, `If there is a problem with radiation, dust is not very healthy.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If Senator Margetts intended to sit in the bus and if she has genuine concerns, a number of questions are raised. Why did she cost the taxpayers of Australia the return trips to Darwin and Darwin to Ranger? Why did she insist that taxpayers buy her a dose meter which she then did not trust and, of course, would have been of little use in the bus, anyway. If Senator Margetts is serious, she might like to know that on her weekly flights between Canberra and Perth she receives 13 microsieverts as compared with the two to three she would have received at Ranger. She could, of course, go by road between Perth <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3555"> and Canberra but to do so she would have to avoid bitumen roads and granite outcrops to avoid being exposed to radiation levels similar to or greater than she would have been exposed to at Ranger. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></ANSWER>

That is on top of the other election promises that were delivered in full and on time, of course: the family tax initiative, the private health insurance initiative, the capital gains tax rollover relief for small business, the reduction in provisional tax uplift factor and other things that will benefit small business and average Australians. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now, not more than a month after the budget, a major business house, we see, is announcing plans which are tailored to take advantage of our proposal. We want to see and to encourage further participation in employees' share schemes and to encourage greater voluntary saving. We want to see more employees owning shares in their employers' businesses through employees' share schemes because through those schemes we can promote greater industrial harmony and help break down the barriers between management and employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Employees' share schemes have a very important and significant role in this case. That is why we announced in the budget that, from 1 July 1996, the value of shares or rights that may be tax exempt under qualifying employees' schemes will be doubled from $500 to $1,000 per employee per year. On top of that, from 1 July this year, the government will ease the employee participation conditions for qualifying employees' share schemes from 75 per cent of permanent employees to two-thirds of permanent employees for shares under the tax deferral concession and for shares and rights under the exemption concession. That will make it much easier for employees' share schemes to meet the participation conditions with the flow-on effect of concessional tax treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Legislation will be introduced into the parliament in the next few weeks to give effect to those proposals, which I must say are in quite stark contrast to the Labor Party's policies in relation to this area. The Senate will recall that in the 1994 budget Labor unveiled a plan to impose fringe benefits tax on those schemes. Labor's 1994 budget announcement would have thrown employees' share schemes pretty well out the window overnight and it was clear to everybody but the then Treasurer, Mr Willis, that the plan would spell the death knell of those schemes, in stark contrast to ours. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

The benefits of the minister attending the APEC ministerial conference are generally those of being in touch with SME ministers in our region and the networking that results. I can understand the strange questions being asked from the other side, because this minister happens to be a real, genuine small business operator who started from scratch.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to the outrageous allegations of the minister's non&hyphen;attendance, I have been advised by the minister that the sessions covered Thursday, 5 September and the morning of Friday, 6 September. The minister attended sessions at which he gave reports on the 1995 Adelaide APEC&hyphen;SME ministerial conference and a report on the business matching and facilitation project. During some sessions the minister attended bilateral discussions with other ministers, which is not unusual, but at all times representatives of the delegation were present at the meeting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister also advised me that, like two other members of the Australian delegation, he suffered an abdominal complaint that required his absence from some of the sessions. As to the full particulars of what was discussed at these sessions, these will be provided in a full report of the meeting that is in the process of being prepared in consultation with his department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister did not attend the final press conference as the only flight available for him and a number of other delegates to leave Sabu was the 2.30 flight to Singapore. Otherwise he and his delegation would have had to remain in the Philippines for another night&mdash;at considerable cost to the Australian taxpayer.</PARA>

Therefore, basically, the journalist was trying to find out whether or not I had got out at Kakadu.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During his statement today the minister also made comments about what information is available on Ranger workers. That is more the substantive issue. I believe that I am owed an apology because the information is not correct.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Parer), to questions without notice asked by Senator Lees and Senator O'Brien today, relating to the cessation of the ethanol bounty scheme.</PARA>
<PARA>As the Minister for Resources and Energy said, the horse is dead. If it is, it is thanks to the minister who I presume has deliberately pursued a policy of removing what I think many in the oil industry see as a threat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will come back to the substantive matter and deal initially with the unsourced document that was tabled in this place a few weeks ago. I ask the minister: firstly, why is it unsourced? I think it is most unusual for a document to be put down in this place in this way. Perhaps the back page is missing. I have no bibliography, no attachments, to tell me what documentation you used to put this together. There is no indication of which scientific materials, what research papers, were used and which departments were involved. If you read through the body of it, you find that several departments are mentioned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I begin by calling on the minister to please put before this chamber all the documents he used to put together this unsourced document. If we are not able to get them, shall we say, easily and, hopefully, happily minister, we will probably have to go through the process <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of a return to order to make sure that we can find our way through the maze to establish how on earth you came to many of the very strange conclusions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will just deal very briefly with a few of the conclusions. On the question of whether or not this industry is competitive, I would argue that it was never intended that the industry would be up and running in the two years that it has had the bounty scheme. Indeed it was given seed funding to enable it to begin to get going, to begin to prove that it was going to be in the longer term economically viable and that it could be competitive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can find no evidence that ABARE ever conducted a current or future analysis of ethanol production in Australia. ABARE foreshadowed discussions of this kind with Manildra, the company&mdash;in particular, with some financial personnel from the company&mdash;but never actually proceeded with this review. The model that it has used incorrectly relied on Brazilian data and, I believe, some United States data. So in conducting its overall analysis, ABARE further compounds its error by concentrating on Brazil and US models, which are not representative of ethanol production in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We then come to the question of a robust industry. As I said in my question, the petroleum division of DPIE controlled the issue of production losses. There was no chance for the industry to build up to the point where we really could begin to talk about whether or not it was robust. It seems that outside of New South Wales there was no active encouragement for expansion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The refusal of large foreign owned oil companies to distribute and market fuel ethanol initially imposed severe limits on the capacity of producers to take up the bounty allocation in these first two years of the scheme. Despite this policy of non-cooperation adopted by the major oil companies, ethanol producers succeeded in establishing a steadily expanding market in New South Wales&mdash;a steadily expanding market for fuel ethanol with the cooperation of the independent oil companies who were prepared to look at a new product and to take what <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3562"> they saw as a risk. But it turned out to be quite profitable for them. I have been reliably informed that, as fast as the ethanol could be produced, it was able to be marketed through independent oil companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Advice from one ethanol producer that their company would, with the benefit of the bounty, produce ethanol by 2000 without any further need for support was totally ignored. Indeed, nowhere in this document do you find that any real opportunity has been given for the companies, particularly Manildra, to put their point of view or to in any way refute some of the very questionable evidence that has been put before us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the question of ecological sustainability, the evaluation that we have before us at no time actually makes the claim that the scheme was a complete failure, as the minister said on a couple of occasions. In misrepresenting the Australian production model, BRS incorrectly ascribes soil carbon flux to ethanol produced from industrial wastes from annual food crops. BRS acknowledged international research on the benefits of ethanol in relation to emissions of primary vehicle resource pollutants, but also identified complexities in determining the level of any evaporative emissions associated with ethanol fuel blends. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to enter this ethanol debate for a very short period, because it is something that I have had experience with in the past. I have had experience of trying to set up a plant to produce ethanol on farm. In the United States from around 1965 to 1970 there was the big push for ethanol production with the so-called world oil crisis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, you have to face realities. Ethanol production was first tried in Australia, somewhat successfully, during World War II because there was no other alternative. Cost was not a consideration because, if fuel was required, it had to be manufactured and it had to be got hold of somehow. It was tried with reasonable success. But we do not know for certain because that cost was not compared with other fuels. At the time gas producers seemed to have been far more efficient in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> producing for the average smaller vehicle, although gas producers were pretty useless when it came to heavy vehicles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next upsurge in the idea of producing ethanol as an alternative fuel came in about 1969 in Australia. It was tried at a time when the world overproduction of wheat was on and when Australia, for a very short time, had wheat quotas. There were a few experimental plants in Australia. But, even with wheat in those days of 1969-70 at around $50 a tonne, it was not viable to produce ethanol and use it successfully even with the rising world prices of oil.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During that time I personally got quotes from the United States to get a plant out in order to erect on the farm and produce ethanol. But when you worked out that, with the average farm production unit the United States supplied at the time, it would take virtually two or three years to manufacture ethanol that you would use in one year; the cost factor was blown out as well as not being able to get enough production. Then, of course, wheat prices took a big jump in 1973-74 and ethanol was put on the backburner again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> We have the case here, as has come out today, where, in order to get last year's budget through, some toing-and-froing went on with the Democrats and a certain amount was inserted into the budget to have a look at the ethanol situation again. Unfortunately, economics has proven that both ethanol and the cost of production of ethanol at the present moment cannot compete with other fuels. Furthermore, as Senator Margetts would know, the Metropolitan Transport Trust in Perth&mdash;Metrobus or whatever they call it&mdash;has had a couple of diesel buses converted to run on ethanol running around for quite some time. Although the operation has been rather successful, unfortunately, the economics has not. In this day of economic rationalism, which I support, ethanol has not reached the position where it can be economically manufactured. I mean, you can subsidise and you can subsidise, but there has been nothing new over the years. Until we come to a stage where it is somewhere near economically <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3563"> viable, I think it has to be left where it is now, and that is on the backburner.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will discuss the ethanol rebate scheme after the clayton's ethanol debate that we just had from Senator Boswell, as much as I would love to get into the issue of the dependent spouse allowance on Aust <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> udy, which Senator Boswell has misrepresented in this chamber today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this chamber today, Senator Parer in response to Senator Lees, said that the Australian Democrats were, in fact, flogging a dead horse. It is a horse that the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Parer) killed. Two years is all this scheme has had to establish itself. It is outrageous for this government to pull the props and assistance out from the rebate scheme&mdash;the one commitment by this nation to the development of alternative fuels and a sustainable industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Panizza made the comment that ethanol was produced during World War II. That is true. But he claimed it was because there were no other alternatives. The reality that this chamber and this country has to wake up to is that after 2010 there will be no fuel alternatives, that in actual fact the exploitable reserves of oil in this country will run out. We do not have alternatives. It is about time we established and committed ourselves to renewable and sustainable industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for the report referred to, Senator Lees said in this chamber that in fact the report that has been peddled&mdash;not only in this parliament but in the press gallery&mdash;is an unsourced report. I wonder whether it is standard practice to table reports in this place that are unsourced and that have spurious recommendations and reach dubious conclusions? Senator Woodley referred to his suspicions as to who might have been responsible for the report. I would like to ask the minister, as did Senator Lees, for all documents pertaining to the conclusions he expressed in this chamber today to be tabled in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Through you, Mr Deputy President, I would also like to ask the minister to address the issue of jobs. Senator Lees and others have been inundated. Farmers from rural New South Wales properties have been ringing and faxing us in despair over job losses through the removal of this rebate. We are talking farm jobs as well as jobs associated with particular production plants. And I repeat Senator Woodley's request. I hope the minister has visited Manildra. I have been there and I have met with people there, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3565"> including Mr Gordon. I certainly hope the minister has visited Manildra and looked at the processes being developed there. They have put $28 million into research and the development of renewable industries. And what has this government done? It has just removed it. How many businesses and industries are expected to establish themselves in two years, especially an industry such as this with a long&hyphen;term, sustainable objective? It is an absolute outrage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to refer to the minister's comments today regarding a report in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>. I believe the minister misrepresented that report when he talked about the environmental aspects and benefits of this particular scheme. The minister referred to comments by the ACF. I would like to hear directly from the ACF, with all due respect, because I think the ACF may have said something rather different from what was reported in this place. In fact, there is a fundamental difference between ethanol production in countries such as the United States and Brazil where crops are grown exclusively for the production of ethanol. Bob Gordon of Manildra pointed out that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unlike Brazil or the US, where crops are grown exclusively as feedstock for ethanol and where they could be net emitters of greenhouse gases&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and that is acknowledged&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">virtually all the country (Australia) could be supplied (with ethanol) as the bi&hyphen;products from existing crops grown for other reasons, such as food.</PARA>
<PARA>So the conclusions about net emissions are a furphy. Environmentally and economically we have not seen evidence that demonstrates that the rebate scheme is unsound, inefficient or unproductive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support the recommendations that have been put forward by the Fuel Ethanol Association of Australia which says that Australian interests will be best met by maintaining the bounty scheme without additional funding beyond which has already been allocated. They are not asking for more money; they are asking for the status quo, for maintenance, while closely monitoring its progress with the results of vital R&amp;D programs.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will tell you later. What you did get, and what I tabled in this particular place, was the portfolio evaluation, a management response to the ethanol bounty scheme. It is the complete documentation; there is no other documentation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not going to repeat all the things I said before, but from every aspect this thing was tried and it was a failure. There are tut&hyphen;tuts coming from the Democrats over there. It was your idea so you have to promote it, but the question is whether it is ever going to be economic. The answer has to be no. You say, `Well, you have only given it two years; it was a three&hyphen;year program.' The amount of uptake in the first two years was fairly minor, $3 million but, in taking a very sensible decision after an in&hyphen;depth evaluation, we have saved the taxpayers of this country $20 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But that is not the only reason. Other reasons have been outlined in the full report, and that is why I tabled it. If, having read the tabled document, you still have some dispute with it, by all means canvass it. But I would <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3566"> say that any reasonable person in this country, having read that document, could come to no other conclusion than to abandon the particular project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not as though we are walking away from alternative energies. We are totally supportive of alternative energies, provided the proposal is practical, not pixie stuff. This proposal fits into the pixie category, regrettably.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have assisted the Energy Research and Development Corporation's continuing research into ethanol. We have maintained the budget figure for the lignocellulosic pilot plant&mdash;the use of woody waste. Perhaps, with the passage of time, that technology will be able to produce liquid fuels which are competitive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue of competitiveness was raised. I point out again that the cost of producing ethanol is in the order of 70c a litre, with no indication of that figure coming down. The estimate of 30c to 40c a litre does not bear scrutiny. The current production of liquid fuels from oil is about 23c a litre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bounty amounted to 18c a litre. All up, if you take into account the excise that applies to fossil fuels and the state excise levies, you are looking at all&hyphen;up support for the industry of 60c a litre. Even with removal of the bounty, which saves the Australian taxpayer $20 million, there is still an amount of 40c a litre where the alternative fuel industry has a lead over fossil fuels. I would have thought that was fairly substantial.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come now to the crocodile tears shed by some senators. It was made very clear to me that ethanol is a by&hyphen;product of CSR at Sarina and also the gluten manufacturer at Manildra. Certainly, they would have liked it to continue&mdash;anyone likes to keep the money coming in. But it was also made very clear to me that the work being done at Manildra and CSR will continue; it will not change.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That document indicates that, even without mining, there is $5.7 billion annually of subsidy by state and federal government&mdash;money that could be spent in many productive ways. That $5.7 billion could go to fiscal assistance for resource extraction industries in Australia&mdash;and that is without the environmental subsidies of $8.5 billion per year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If what we are hearing is correct&mdash;Senator Parer probably knows that a number of people from his department were at Monday's seminar conducted by Brian Fleay&mdash;we will have to look for alternatives to petroleum. We are reaching the halfway point of the world's petroleum resources, so the price for petroleum will vary immensely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If Australia does not position itself for renewable, non&hyphen;fossil fuel sources of energy, especially those that can be used for car and truck engines, we will be behind the eight ball. It makes no sense at all. I can see no forward thinking by the government in this regard.

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">Hospital Funding</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Family Services. The cuts in the budget for public hospital funding, some $312 million across all States, are apparently <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3567"> there because the States have been cost shifting. Could you please explain what has been happening with regard to cost shifting? What have the States been doing? Which States have been doing what? How are you going to spread those $312 million in cuts over four years across the States? Finally, given the enormous problems facing our public hospital system, is your government prepared to reconsider this move and, in particular, are you prepared to consider allocating the one per cent increase in the Medicare levy for high income earners directly into the public hospital system?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Minister, when you are seeking further details from the Minister for Health, could you please ask if he will again reconsider this move, considering the pressure that the public hospital system is under. Last June&mdash;you are quite right&mdash;all States agreed to stop cost shifting, but they are insisting that they have stopped cost shifting. So can you ask the Minister what evidence he has of where the cost shifting is occurring, and who is doing what? My final question is: could you please again check whether he is prepared to look at allocating the increase in the Medicare levy directly into the state public hospital system?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Lees asked several questions about the Budget measure addressing cost shifting under the Medicare program. I indicated that I would follow up on the details of this matter. I now have the relevant information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has been no cut in the Budget to hospital funding. The Forward Estimates show that Hospital Financing Grants have been maintained in their entirety across the four years of the estimate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">No efficiency dividend has been applied to Hospital Financing Grants, despite the significant improvements in efficiency in public hospitals in recent years. The Commonwealth would have been justified in asking the States for a share of these savings, but chose not to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cost shifting measure is not a cut to hospital funding. This measure is an acknowledgment that the Commonwealth is recouping some of the money being taken out of the Medicare system by the States, contrary to the commitment given at the April 1995 meeting of Health Ministers. Given that the amount being cost-shifted is greater than the amount being recouped, it could be said that hospital funding has actually been increased.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Cost-shifting is still going on&mdash;for example, one Melbourne hospital has 62 privatised out-patient services, some of which have been established very recently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">States cost-shift at different levels&mdash;at this point we do not have precise data. Estimates are based on Health Insurance Commission data, and the Department of Health is confident that over the coming months very exact figures can be devel <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> oped. The cost-shifting measure recoups costs in proportion to the amounts by which States cost-shift.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has already recognised the problems of public hospitals by its decision not to apply an efficiency dividend to Hospital Financing Grants. Difficulties the hospitals experience are related to the decisions made by State Governments about their hospital funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Health has advised me that no State has stopped cost-shifting, and substantial evidence from medical practitioners who are being pressured to change the way they treat patients in casualty in public hospitals, and also to arrange pre- and post-operative work-ups away from hospitals gives a clear indication that the practice continues, in contravention of the Medicare Agreements.</PARA></QUESTION></QUESTION.BLOCK></QWN>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments to the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Administration) Act 1992 will ensure that the national registration authority for agricultural and veterinary chemicals (NRA) is required to comply with the policy directions of the Agricultural and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand. This is in accordance with the principle of the Commonwealth, state, and territory governments being equal partners in setting the policy direction of the national registration scheme for agricultural and veterinary chemicals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of the other proposed amendments are collectively concerned with the department of primary industries and energy's management of chemicals subject to import and export restrictions under international obligations such as the prior informed consent procedures. The obtaining of information about chemical products from the NRA is a factor in that management. The proposed amendments will not place any additional reporting burden on the chemical industry as the necessary information is already required to be provided to the NRA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Provision is also proposed for the NRA to be able to impose a fee for the issuing of certificates of export. Those certificates relate to requests from the chemical industry or importing countries to establish the bona fides of a particular chemical product following evaluation of the product by the NRA. Appeal provisions to the administrative appeals tribunal will be available to aggrieved applicants in the event of the NRA's refusal to issue a certificate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments to the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Act 1994 clarify the application of the compensation provisions under part 3 of the code. Those provisions apply when certain information is provided on request to the NRA as part of the review of existing agricultural and veterinary chemicals. The related transitional provisions have also been clarified.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also proposed to introduce provisions to streamline the issuing of national notices under the agvet codes. This will enable the NRA to issue one national notice rather than separate notices for each jurisdiction, and represents improved efficiency for the NRA. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment to the Fisheries Management Act 1991 will provide that where there is an acquisition of property within the meaning of paragraph 31 of section 51 of the constitution, reasonable compensation or compensation as determined by the federal court, is payable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Farm Household Support Act 1992 is being amended to ensure that the drought relief payment is payable to eligible farmers only within the period specified on the drought exceptional circumstances certificate. This will ensure that drought relief payments are used by eligible farmers to meet their basic living expenses only during those periods of extreme drought.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to reinsert drought relief payment to section 43(1) are to correct previous consequential amendments which erroneously omitted drought relief payment from this section.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Farm Household Support Act 1992 is also being amended to exempt from the drought relief payment income test any proceeds from the forced disposal of livestock.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment will correct an anomaly in the existing legislation governing the payment of drought relief payment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present, for the purposes of the drought relief payment, if a farmer is forced to dispose of livestock due to extreme drought, the proceeds from the forced sale are treated as income for the period in which they are received.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This means the proceeds are assessed under the income test for the drought relief payment. The effect of this treatment is that the farmer may be excluded from assistance under the drought relief payment or have his or her entitlement reduced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following this amendment all proceeds from the forced disposal of livestock will be excluded from the income test for the purpose of the drought relief payment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the amendment to the Imported Food Control Act 1992 is to allow persons other than officers of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) to be appointed as authorised officers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment will allow quarantine officers of the various state and territory departments of agriculture to be involved in the inspection of food imported into Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AQIS anticipates a more effective and efficient service to clients as a consequence of the amendment as it minimises, where possible, the duplication of inspection activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the amendment of the Quarantine Act 1908 is to provide for a system which allows for the issue of penalty notices, which are better known as on&hyphen;the&hyphen;spot fines, to persons alleged to have breached Australia's Quarantine Act or <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3572"> regulations by failing to declare, or intentionally incorrectly declaring, goods of quarantine concern when entering australia. Initially the system will be operated at all Australia's international airports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The system will allow the imposition of a penalty for relatively minor offences which, under existing arrangements, would not normally be able to be pursued through the courts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The existence of the system will be widely advertised and is expected to increase compliance with Australia's quarantine requirements and thus minimise the risk to australia's agricultural industries.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DX5">Senator MARGETTS</NAME>
<STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(11.32 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the first opportunity, apart from by way of personal explanation, I have had to deal with the issues that were brought up during question time today in relation to the answer from the Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator Parer, to the question by Senator Ferris. The issues that were raised by way of a question on the radiation levels at Ranger uranium mine were in fact an effort to have a cheap shot and a bit of a laugh at my expense. It is interesting. As I pointed out during my explanation, the minister does owe me apologies and I will be expecting to receive those apologies in relation to the incorrect information he has given to the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there is some further information that is necessary to add to this. The workers at Ranger uranium mine&mdash;it was Ranger that was mentioned&mdash;do not have an accurate record of how much radiation they receive. The method currently being used at Ranger tends to be an average method. There is equipment in various locations throughout the mine which measure radiation.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3573">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, for cost reasons, and this was given as evidence to the inquiry, the Ranger uranium mine no longer requires all its workers in the mine to wear even the film badges that I wore to the uranium mine during the recent hearings and visits. Only those people who are virtually constantly working in restricted areas are required to wear them. In areas that are constantly dusty there are other requirements, which include breathing apparatus, and I believe there are other hazardous areas within the mine and the mill which are not necessarily related only to radiation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But statements about the doses that individual workers are subject to are made now on averages only. This can mean that, if there is an average of five, some people may be getting eight or nine and some people may be getting two. Unfortunately most individual workers will not have an accurate record of the doses of radiation they have received while working in the mines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think there are many people more aware than me of the fact that being a politician is an unhealthy lifestyle. I am also aware that various forms of radiation occur from granite buildings. I am aware of the fact that the natural environment is an area where there is naturally occurring radiation. I do not tend to spend hours and hours on top of granite outcrops, but I am working in a building which is made of various sorts of emitters of radiation; I am aware of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also aware of the fact that flying in aircraft, which I do not particularly like doing, is not a particularly healthy thing to do. There are of course levels of radiation which occur from that. In fact, I was interested in finding out just how unhealthy this lifestyle is. My initial inquiries about a year ago were to find out whether or not I could wear a cumulative dose meter for the whole of the year and get it checked from time to time to find out how unhealthy this lifestyle is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Parer, during the course of today's very badly informed answer to Senator Ferris, mentioned that I refused to get out of the bus. Yes; in the bottom of the pit of Ranger 1 ore body, where there was still workings going on, I did not actually get out of the bus, that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is true. At other areas of the mine site and around the mill, including the artificial wetlands to try to leach out the radiation, it is true that I did not get out of the bus; I made a choice. We had had those issues explained. I had been with the rest of the committee members and taking copious notes during the briefings that we were given by the mine staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think a number of people would agree with me that I was taking what is known as basic radiological protection measures at the bottom of the pit. The protection measures were in relation to the possible inhalation or ingestion of small particles of dust. The minister seemed not to understand the difference between gamma rays and alpha emitters. I understand that the actual background radiation in some of those areas that may have been dusty may not necessarily have been high. But, in the vicinity of a uranium mine, of course you are going to get uranium dust. You also may get remnants of thorium&hyphen;234, or thorium&hyphen;230 or radium&hyphen;226.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a lot of dust around a mine, and I think it is eminently sensible for anybody not to deliberately breathe in that dust if they have a choice; that is, they can see what the bottom of the pit, the mine and the mill look like and they have had that explained to them, and they choose not to get out of the bus for three minutes at the bottom of the pit. I do not see why that was considered to be such an extraordinary thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also visited Rum Jungle. Perhaps I did a less sensible thing at Rum Jungle, where there is no dust from a current mine. Of course, this mine was used long ago but it is still in a disgraceful condition. Much of the radiation from almost any mine remains at the mine site in the form of waste. The thorium&hyphen;234, thorium&hyphen;230 and radium&hyphen;226 are still there. Of course, when they mine for uranium they try to retrieve a large portion of the uranium, but the larger portion of the radiation remains at the mine site.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also true that other areas within that region have high levels of recorded radiation. It is also true that water courses within that region have been contaminated. The fact that the level of contamination in the water may <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3574"> be similar to the level of radiation you might read from a granite outcrop does not necessarily accord. You do not drink granite outcrops, but people are expected to drink water. If the outcomes of mining or milling activities are that radiation gets into the water system, then comparing it, for instance, to background radiation of granite rock outcrops is immaterial.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, you do not drink large granite rocks in general, but people are being expected to drink water which may be contaminated. Whether it is ground water through artificial wetlands, in the end that water system will be contaminated by radiation. If you create artificial wetlands, then the soil itself is being deliberately contaminated by radiation by being some sort of filter to try to stop all of that radiation going through into the ground water system. We are talking about wetlands here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During our inquiries we did look at Nabarlek. Once again, at Nabarlek there is waste rock, there is waste in the pit, but the majority of radiation is still there. I think it is extremely important that people do have accurate information about the implications for workers. We are adjusting them down all the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also important to understand that, during the inquiry in Darwin, the Northern Territory government said if only a very careful check of radiation at Ranger had have been done and that, if the check that was done had not been done, the average radiation levels would have been shown to be a lot lower. I thought that was interesting. Why would people coming to check the radiation levels have a much higher reading? I asked whether those people were wearing accurate dose meters all the time and the answer was yes, they were. So why did the people who came to check the mine end up with much higher readings? The answer given was, `Senator, that's because they must have been staying in restricted areas much longer than the average worker.' I find that amazing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In visiting the four uranium mines, I thought it would be a useful piece of personal information to find out, even by staying in the bus, what level of exposure there was from <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> walking on Nabarlek, talking at the mine site at Ranger&mdash;we only flew over the site for Jabiluka&mdash;and visiting the appalling mess of Rum Jungle and Rum Jungle South. During those activities, yes, I did have with me a film badge, although I would have liked to have had a dose meter that showed me readings. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Is it the case that the use of bullbars on cars and other vehicles is illegal under Federal Australian Design Rule 42.9.1.1, or any other regulation or legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Are the restrictions on the use of bullbars being enforced by the State Governments.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) Are there any proposals currently under consideration to develop or enforce tighter restrictions on the use of bullbars.</PARA></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="3575" SPEAKER="Alston, Sen Richard" NAMEID="LD4" ELECTORATE="VIC" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Communications and the Arts" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator Alston</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Transport and Regional Development has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Australian Design Rule 42 does not specifically proscribe bullbars, but clause 42.9.1.1 seeks to prohibit external and internal projections which are not technically essential to the vehicle. The issue of whether or not a bullbar is technically essential hinges on the consideration of the environment in which the vehicle operates. Country drivers argue strongly that a bullbar is essential for rural operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A more recent issue is the effect that bullbars may have on the crash performance of vehicles required to comply with Australian Design Rule 69/00&mdash;Full Frontal Impact Occupant Protection. The fitting of bullbars to vehicles after they have been sold to the market could compromise compliance with this rule. Some vehicle manufacturers have developed bullbar designs which do not adversely affect the crash performance of vehicles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Design Rules apply to the design and construction of vehicles when first supplied to the market in Australia. Regulation of the use of vehicles and associated equipment when they are in service is the responsibility of the States and Territories. Generally they require on&hyphen;going compliance with the Australian Design Rules which applied when the vehicle was manufactured, but can <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3576"> make exceptions as outlined in the answer to part 2 of this question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The State Governments have permitted the use of bullbars, and in fact Clause 96(8) of the Victorian Road Safety Act 1986 reads `Regulations made under this Act must not (a) prohibit the fitting of bullbars to motor vehicles'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The Federal Office of Road Safety has reviewed the Fatality File for 1992 which shows that of the 350 pedestrian fatalities in that year, 38 crashes involved vehicles fitted with bullbars. Of these 38 crashes, there were 3 passenger cars, 12 off&hyphen;road vehicles, 4 utilities and 19 trucks. 101 vehicles were not fitted with bullbars and there were 173 vehicles for which the accident report did not record the presence or absence of bullbars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not possible with the available data to determine whether the presence of bullbars in these crashes was the predominant cause of fatalities. Pedestrian fatalities are the result of a complex set of factors and the relative contribution of each is difficult to determine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) A working group comprising Government authorities, industry representatives, road user groups and researchers, is working towards resolving the long standing debate over the effect of bullbars on pedestrians, and the more recent concerns over their effect on crash performance of modern vehicles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are design issues which need to be addressed. Some bullbars are unduly aggressive to pedestrians, with sharp edges and small diameter tubing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bullbar working group is considering a proposal to develop an Australian Standard for the design and mounting of bullbars. The aim is to ensure that bullbars will be designed to minimise injury to pedestrians by attending to details such as the shape and projection of the bullbar as well as incorporating energy absorbing padding and addressing concerns regarding any adverse effects of the crash performance of the vehicle.</PARA>
