<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill is about the right of all Australians to speak freely and inform others of their political and electoral choices. It repeals section 329A of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, under which it is an offence to advocate a method of voting which is in fact legal, formal and legitimate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 329A was controversial when it was introduced in December 1992 and has become more so with each subsequent election.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1996 we had the spectacle of Albert Langer being imprisoned for 10 weeks for contempt of court because he refused to stop advocating a perfectly legal form of voting. Amnesty International described him as Australia's first prisoner of conscience for over 20 years. The now Prime Minister Mr Howard described s.329A as a `silly law' and `an unacceptable infringement of the right to free speech' (letter to Mr Ken Partridge, Launceston, 28 February 1996).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I promised during the election campaign that one of my first actions, if elected, would be a move to repeal this law. This bill fulfils that commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I want to emphasise that my concern is with free speech. I am not supporting or endorsing the form of optional preferential voting that is permitted under the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Greens believe that proportional representation is the fairest and most democratic voting system, and that the national parliament should follow Tasmania and the ACT, not to mention most European countries and New Zealand, by adopting it. Under the current system of voting for the House of Representatives, half the electorate will end up with a member that they didn't vote for or to whom they are actively opposed. Proportional representation with multi&hyphen;member electorates enables everyone to be represented by at least one member who reflects view similar to their own. I have already flagged that I will be proposing amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act to introduce proportional representation.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the willingness to allow Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to be made scapegoats to deflect attention from issues of unemployment and growing inequalities in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>While I was reading out those issues I heard people from the other side of the chamber saying that this is old. What we have today so far is an accumulation of points which lead up to this censure. I do not take such an issue lightly. This is the first time in three years in this place that I have moved a censure motion and it should be made very clear at the outset that my decision has not been taken lightly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have become increasingly concerned in recent times about the incompetence and insensitivity of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron). My motion refers to five key issues, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3753"> and I will address my comments in relation to those matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first issue is the actions of the minister in relation to the appointment of a special auditor to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. This decision was made early in the minister's time in his new portfolio and it has subsequently been found by the Federal Court that the minister had no power to set up the audit process. This flawed decision is indicative of an appalling lack of due care on its own, but it escalates to outrageous proportions when the financial implications of the decision are taken into account. There are huge hurts being felt by many people in terms of self-determination, but it is a slap in the face for people to find out that steps to move away from self-determination will actually be charged to those people who are most affected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">ATSIC was forced at the time of the appointment to set aside $750,000 to fund this special auditor, but this budget blew out to more than $830,000 within the first few weeks. The result of this bungle by the minister and his advisers is ATSIC is being forced to pay nearly $1 million. Will this have to be paid for by a reduction in services to Aboriginal communities?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Throughout this Senate there have been many occasions in industry or otherwise when the issue of some people not using funds as they were intended has been brought up. It has never been argued by the coalition in relation to industry that something like a 10 per cent figure in relation to funding for a program or a subsidy would mean that the program suddenly was frozen, the program suddenly was stopped or an independent auditor was immediately introduced. It certainly would not happen to business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second issue referred to in my motion is the debacle that occurred during the debate on the ATSIC Amendment Bill 1996 (No. 2). This bill dealt with structural changes to ATSIC and had some very important implications for the 1996 ATSIC elections. One of the changes was in relation to the eligibility criteria for ATSIC councillors, which my office determined immediately prior to the debate on this bill would take effect after <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> nominations had closed for the 1996 election. This could have led to a situation in which the entire ATSIC elections, which cost millions of dollars to conduct, could have been deemed invalid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was only after this matter was raised with the minister and he at last realised the extraordinary implications of proceeding with those sections of the bill that amended eligibility criteria that the government decided to withdraw the offending section from this bill. I am pleased to say there was support from others in this chamber to do so. I am happy to provide advice to the minister, but perhaps I should be claiming higher duties allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third issue referred to in the censure motion is the inability of the minister to comprehend the outcomes of his own decisions which impact on the quality of life and the push for self-determination by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. There appears to be a denial of the fact that the funding that is currently provided to state, territory and local governments to provide such services as health or education to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities may simply be absorbed into those bodies' general revenue, leaving communities totally dependent either on ATSIC funding or on the royalties of mining, as is the case in the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where is the accountability in that? When people have talked about accountability, has anybody not mentioned to the minister that the accountability should be to the people to whom those services should be provided? If ATSIC is considered to be necessary for intervention by the government, how much more should state, territory and local governments be given when they are provided taxpayers' money at much greater levels to provide health, education and community services? How many of those dollars have been followed through to their final point? How many? How many areas only get access to royalties? How many areas virtually only get access to ATSIC funding?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that some health dollars are spent, but there is no tracing through, as far as I can see, to make sure that those dollars that are provided to those bodies get to where they are <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3754"> supposed to go. It is inevitable that, if you leave all other services to ATSIC, you will find they will be unable to provide all of those services to all of those communities. The funding is not accountable in that sense. We seem to have a very skewed opinion in relation to who should be targeted in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead of providing greater self-determination, the minister is removing the decision making power from those bodies. The minister's response in not realising that ATSIC had been left with an impossible task is to cut funding for ATSIC programs. It should be said that this policy is largely poll driven, given the minister's preference for quoting polls, which he claims indicate that most Australians are not happy to see Aboriginal people receive more than their fair share of the taxpayers' dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister's statements and actions reflect the mind&hyphen;set. This ignores the very real discrimination which has existed for Aboriginal people since the arrival of Europeans on this continent and whether or not those dollars which are down as being available to Aboriginal people which are going through state, territory and local governments are going to the point to which they are meant to be going. If that is indeed the case, the minister should tell us that it is so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth element of the censure motion refers to the promotion of inappropriate and outdated policies of assimilation. Many Aboriginal people bear the psychological scars which result from the paternalistic and assimilationist policies that dominated thinking on Aboriginal issues in this country until very recently. The minister's attitude to `the stolen generation' inquiry is reflective of this position. I have spoken to Aboriginal people in Western Australia who are friends of mine who have suffered greatly as a result of the policies that took them away from their parents. Those scars are not going to disappear quickly as a result of their speaking to the inquiry and, as the minister says, `getting it out of your system'. That was a recent statement by the minister.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, I have spoken to Aboriginal people who are friends of mine who were taken away from their parents. Those scars are not going to disappear quickly. We only need to consider the impact of this forced separation on the former head of the Aboriginal Legal Service in Western Australia to realise the enormity of the task that we as a nation must confront.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister's statements on this and other matters has not helped in the process of reconciliation that must happen before we can move on, if there is a duty of care for ministers. If this involved a teacher, we would say that the teacher has breached their duty of care. It is quite clear that the minister considers that benefits have accrued to those who were forcibly separated from their parents. Perhaps he believes that these benefits are so great that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders do not feel real agony in telling strangers about their experiences.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There was acceptance by the minister that he regrets that the stolen generation was horrific, but at the moment we still do not have a report from the government. We still have a reluctance to admit that there was any liability from any government in the past. We have a situation which puts the entire process in limbo at this stage, when the federal government is the only government which has not provided a response.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there was some true understanding and sensitivity, there would be the understanding that what is required is recognition&mdash;recognition that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are human beings and that whatever changes to their lifestyle there may have been as a result of being taken away from their parents, there is no substitution for that sense of identity that has been lost, that sense of loss of culture and that sense of loss of language. Only now are we seeing communities who are trying desperately to regain that sense of culture and that social cohesion to be able to teach language and culture to their children. At this point communities are realising that they need to regain some of what they have lost several generations on. That hurt and damage has lasted for several generations. As communities are trying to regain that sense of community, now is the vital time when that support should be given.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst the minister may originally have made some unplanned gaffes due to inexperience, the poll&hyphen;driven response from the government has been to turn mistake into <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> policy direction. If there is any real duty of care for ministers, this would have to be about as low as a government can stoop. It is convenient for the Howard government to use Aboriginal people as scapegoats to divert attention from both the decisions they made in concert with the previous government&mdash;which have severely affected the Australian community&mdash;and to justify their current slash and burn budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yes, people were hurting going into the last election. There were many reasons why that was the case. They were promised that things would be as good as they could get. They were told to shut up because they had never had it so good. We had a growing gap between the rich and the poor; we had a growing working poor. We had people on part-time and casual jobs who found that that was the direction their jobs were going.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That disillusioned group of people did not have it explained to them why they were feeling the way they were, why the whole nature of their position in life&mdash;the future for their children in education and the nature of the workplace&mdash;was changing so rapidly. They did not have it explained to them how the changes of internationalisation were affecting them, how competition policy was suddenly making them pay for services that they had not paid for before, how outsourcing was affecting them when even their schools were not being cleaned and how they could not find basic goods and services on their own shelves that were produced in their own country. There was a lot of disillusion. People did not know who to blame, but there were people who came and told them who they could blame.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This may not be from a current coalition member, but it was a very convenient time, wasn't it? The fact that the minister has seen fit to surf in on a wave of scapegoatism deserves censure. Many people in this community have not understood the basis of the change. It is very convenient to point to Aboriginal people. It is very convenient to point to migrants. It is very convenient to point to those young people in our community who have no chance of getting a job under <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3756"> this system. Let us point to them and blame them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that a minister for Aboriginal affairs has been creating this level of confusion in the public arena and using it as a means of gaining some electoral benefit deserves censure. I believe that there should be a duty of care placed on a minister. If you are the minister for Aboriginal affairs, you should not be the minister for scapegoating. Not listening; presenting positions without adequate consultation; showing no understanding of the need for self-determination; making decisions without adequate consultation, even with advisers, which ends up eating further into programs for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people&mdash;all these make the minister for Aboriginal affairs deserving of censure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We currently have a slash and burn budget which is being neatly deflected by the use of scapegoating, using Aboriginal people, amongst others. Let us blame somebody else; let us blame anybody else except the decisions that we are making in this place. It is for these and many other reasons that the minister deserves our censure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure that Labor Party senators and other senators in this chamber have other examples. I have given just some examples today. Yes, some of these issues go back some months now. Yes, that means that, cumulatively, the very strong message needs to be given that this is not good enough. It is not what we would expect of a minister of the federal government. I commend this motion to the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<STATE> (Tasmania)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(10.09 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the motion of censure. Senator Margetts has outlined clearly a very strong case for the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) not being in the position he is in. What is required of a minister representing any section of the community is that he or she represent that community's interests with a deep understanding of them in cabinet and in the affairs of the nation. What we have is a minister who clearly has shown that he does not understand the plight, the position, the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> history and the aspirations of the Aboriginal community in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Margetts has shown, there is a litany of failure in this minister's record already. For the Senate to pass up this opportunity to censure this minister would be to comply with what I believe will be a continuing litany of failure as far as the representation of Aboriginal interests in this country are concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Take a look at just one failure: the illegal application of an audit to ATSIC, costing $1 million, and then charged to ATSIC after the illegality was proven. It simply has meant $1 million less for the Aboriginal community at a time when this government has determined that over the coming years it is going to cut $400 million out of the budget to Aboriginal people through ATSIC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister is aware, because he has made it part of the public record, that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities in Australia is a matter of shame for this whole nation. When one looks at the health records, one sees indices  for almost every area of that community that are four, five, six times worse than those for the wider Australian community. Take a look at the education outcomes. It is quite clear that the average Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander child in this country is being deprived of the opportunities for the future that are expected in the wider community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moreover, if you look at the ability to indulge and grow up in, enjoy, associate with and understand one's own culture, you see little less than a continuing cultural genocide for the Aboriginal culture in this country. At the ministerial level there has to be an understanding that the Aboriginal people aspire to not only holding on to but also reinvigorating what is claimed to be the oldest continuing culture on the face of the planet. It is a culture of enormous significance, not only to this country but also to the world. In particular, it is part of the being of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lip service can be paid to this issue. We can all extol the virtues as we see them&mdash;for example, the art and music of that culture. But that is not the understanding that is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3757"> required of a minister. What is required, Sir, is a deep and abiding understanding of the way the people he represents think and feel and aspire to the future. That is not the way of this minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I again point to his comments on the stolen generation. I hope that the full text of those comments will be tabled in the Senate by the minister or one of the government members today. In reply to the question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, you have to do something about that. Is there any commitment to look at compensation seriously?</PARA>

But I cannot just feel and express that sadness because that is not good enough.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that the Aboriginal people deserve representation which understands and reflects their point of view, and the complexity of that point of view, in the cabinet, in the government and in this parliament. This minister is patently failing the very people he has been put there to represent. That is what this censure motion is about. It is about failure. It is calling to order a government which allows this minister to stay in office when patently he is incapable of carrying out the extraordinarily important job of representing the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sir, let me just end with a word of warning: where you see serial failure like this, you can guarantee that it will continue into the future. But simply debating the matter in the Senate like this is not going to be enough to make this man change the way he misrepresents the Aboriginal people because he is constitutionally incapable of making that change.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3758">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday we were warned that new legislation which will come before this House will give this minister the power to veto Aboriginal objections to mining operations on land which they claim as theirs. That is the ultimate paternalism. That is the ultimate indignity. That is the ultimate example of how we as a nation have a lot yet to learn&mdash;when we have a government saying, `We're going to give this person who's creating turmoil in the Aboriginal community the right to represent the interests of mining companies over the interests of Aboriginal communities' so that their objections will be ridden over the top of by the mining corporations which, of course, have the advantage of being able to come and lobby, have their business dinners and tweak the ears of weak&hyphen;kneed ministers in this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say this quite clearly: this government is not about to give the Aboriginal people proper full control over their destiny in their lands which so many of us believe it is high time were returned to them. I object, sir, to the potential for this minister to be arbitrating a dispute between Aboriginal people and miners, knowing that this government's impulse is to give the go-ahead to the miners. We hit the basis of the matter when we consider the Aboriginal people, with their ancient and magnificent relationship with the land, still facing the prospect of their minister in cabinet turning down their protests and giving the go-ahead to the big mining corporations coming in from outside, without any understanding of that ancient relationship and that cultural intertwining between the Aboriginal people and the land, and saying, `Go ahead; the Aboriginal people will have to suffer the cultural, social, economic and environmental consequences because I say that it is good for you.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not good enough. I thought that kind of destructive paternalism would have passed in the 1960s, the 1970s and perhaps the 1980s. But here we have a government with this minister reinstituting that form of destructive paternalism and the putting of the interests of the quick dollar before the interests of the timeless and honourable relationship which the Aboriginal and Torres Strait <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Islander people of this nation have with their land. It is the wrong way to go; it is the wrong person arbitrating; and this censure ought to be at least the start of a change of direction in which this government is going before it is too late.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There needs to be a new person in this office. The government needs to search its heart and find somebody who relates to and is prepared to represent, in the fullest sense of that word, the interests of the Aboriginal people&mdash;not those of somebody else, be it miners or whoever, but the Aboriginal community. This minister is patently incapable of doing that. I support the motion.</PARA></SPEECH>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3760">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In essence, those judgments confirmed the absolute substance of this first part of this censure motion&mdash;that there was a failure to seek advice. What the judgment said very clearly&mdash;all judges were unanimous on this, and you did not need to be a lawyer, let me tell you, to read it&mdash;was that the parliament, rightly or wrongly, had given to ATSIC the power to make decisions in respect of funding Aboriginal organisations. The minister purported to have exercised his directions under the section of the ATSIC Act. Those directions related to directions to ATSIC in how they should exercise that decision making power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the minister's directions did do, however, was not to in fact give ATSIC directions as to how they should exercise that power; they purported to in fact restrict that power which parliament had given to ATSIC. They purported to restrict it by effectively handing the decision making power to a non-elected, non-appointed&hyphen;by&hyphen;parliament third party&mdash;that is, the special auditor. The effect of his declaring that an organisation was not fit and proper to receive money meant that funding would instantly be cut off without any further reference to ATSIC, the body that parliament had appointed to make those decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what the three judges effectively said in that unanimous judgment of the Federal Court. It was game, set and match. That is why I know that is the real reason the minister has not appealed the decision.</PARA>

I am going on the public record now to say that the minister is now going to do precisely what the judges in the Federal Court said he should have done in the first place. He has now announced, courtesy of those judgments, that he will take the special auditors' reports and send them to ATSIC so that, in consideration of those reports, ATSIC <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> can then take the decision as to whether those funds will be frozen, amended or whatever.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is precisely what the judges of the Federal Court said the minister should have done in the first place. I think that anybody, any fair person&mdash;and there are still a few left in this country&mdash;who reads those judgments of the Federal Court would know that the minister or more properly the government, the cabinet, did not take the carefully considered approach to this they should have. Therefore, the first part of this censure motion is made out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We canvassed the second part at length here in this chamber, and a painful exercise it was indeed. There is no need for me to go over that debate again but simply to recall that at one point during the debate the minister's obvious ignorance as to what the situation was on the ground in respect of the ATSIC elections was so bad that on a number of occasions the interventions of other senators were required to help him out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At one point I actually referred to Senator Kernot as the minister for aboriginal affairs. The clear confusion that existed between those who were attempting to help the minister in the advisers' box and the minister's own clear lack of any grasp of what was happening on the ground was so bad that everyone who participated in that debate in here knows that the second ground of this censure motion has also been made out. So I will not spend any more time on that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third part of this censure motion reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the inability to comprehend the outcomes of his own decisions which impact on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health, education, employment, social cohesion and self determination,</PARA>
<PARA>Again, this has been comprehensively made out unfortunately only in the last week. We all know&mdash;and again it is a matter of public record&mdash;the absolute confusion that was caused on the ground in Aboriginal communities with the CDEP programs which provide such important social cohesion in Aboriginal communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are not without their problems or their failings but they are one of the positive aspects of Aboriginal communities that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3761"> determines&mdash;the only people in Australia to do so&mdash;that they work for their unemployment benefits and for less money than they would get if they exercised their entitlements as all Australians can to get the full measure of those benefits. Those CDEP schemes were thrown into total confusion because of the minister's clear inability to understand what effect his decisions were going to have in Aboriginal communities themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning to health, education, employment, social cohesion and self-determination, I would like to talk about a problem which Senator Margetts referred to and which is shared by a great many people in public life in Australia as well as in the general community. Senator Margetts talked about the fact that a great deal of this stuff is being poll driven, and it is. It has been a part of my public life for the whole 20 years that I have been in public life in the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does not come as any great surprise to me to know that there is a substantial body of opinion in this country which is not sympathetic to the aspirations of Aboriginal Australians or Asian Australians or indeed anyone else who is a non&hyphen;Asian or non-Aboriginal Australian. That attitude has been healthy. There is a long history of it in my own party going back a great many years, I am pleased to say. But that attitude is still alive and well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much publicity has been given recently to the views of the honourable member for Oxley, Pauline Hanson, in this regard. Again, to my total bemusement, comments of surprise are being expressed by some people that the simplistic solutions that she is putting forward for everyone's ills are so popular. I do not think that they are any great surprise. People are always attracted by what apparently are simple solutions. That is perfectly understandable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Wouldn't it be too easy if all of the perceived problems you have in your own life&mdash;and perhaps they might include not having a job or worrying about whether your kids are going to have jobs&mdash;could be solved by simply cutting off foreign aid, stopping immigration completely, kicking the daylights out of Aborigines, being anti-Asian, putting <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> up the shutters and conscripting all young people into the army? That is the prescription.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The absolute disaster that would ensue by even attempting to do that would be obvious after about one week in terms of, for example, our trading relationships with our near neighbours. Nevertheless, I understand perfectly well that in a situation where people have their own priorities on their minds, and those priorities usually are rightly the care of their families and themselves, simple solutions have a very simple appeal attached to them however nonsensical they might be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But one of the problems is that those appeals also run on some very substantial misconceptions that have been around in this community for a long time. Unfortunately, those misconceptions are supported on a daily basis by many people in public life in this country who should know better but don't. I include well and truly among them the Prime Minister of Australia (Mr Howard).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say right up-front that I do not believe for one minute the Prime Minister of Australia is a racist. In fact, he does not even come close in my view. I think I know him far better than that. That is not a tag I would ever place on the Prime Minister. However, if I say that he&mdash;and I am pleased to say that yesterday this changed&mdash;was for a time happy to be seen as a fellow traveller with these sentiments, then I think that is made out well and truly. That was contained in that extraordinarily silly comment he made, but politically astute from his perspective, that we had a new era of free speech in this country. What nonsense that was!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John Howard, being the astute politician that he is&mdash;and he is as astute as they come&mdash;knew perfectly well that that would be accepted by a great many people as a direct reference to Pauline Hanson's much publicised maiden speech. She got more publicity than she deserved to get, but, nevertheless, it was avoidable. He knew that. To keep it all straight, he officially denied those bits that he had to deny, but no-one was in any doubt at all that he was referring to that maiden speech when he said we now enjoy a new freedom of speech in Australia. What nonsense! We <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3762"> have always had an extraordinary degree of freedom of speech in this country.</PARA>

But I did notice&mdash;and I think that his backbench has to be credited for it&mdash;a substantial and positive turn by the Prime Minister in this debate yesterday, and I welcome it at long last.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But everyone out there was in no doubt what he was talking about. Although he officially decried those sentiments, he was referring to the fact that there was a lot of feeling out there that was sympathetic to Pauline Hanson's view. He repeated those comments yesterday in the House of Representatives in question time. It is a comment he has made recently. I know why he is making that comment, because it is coming straight from the research. It has been around in the research for 20 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister said yesterday again in the parliament that people in Australia do not mind having their taxpayers' money spent on Australian Aboriginal people, but they hate seeing it wasted. There is no return for it. He has been on the public record again and again with that for months. Of course it is a popular misconception that hundreds of millions of dollars&mdash;to quote the Prime Minister again from yesterday&mdash;over the last century have been spent on Aborigines with no return.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These ungrateful people are still dying from disease and still failing to be educated sufficiently, despite the fact that we&mdash;the non-Aborigines&mdash;are spending all of these hundreds of millions of dollars on them! In the same way that we have rightly spent over the same period of time thousands of millions of dollars on essential services for small isolated communities all over Australia. But that is never mentioned in the debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have not got time now to attack all of these misconceptions, but let me tell you that I am going to. Shortly, there will be a time in this parliament when people will be sick and tired of hearing me dissect the arguments.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator BOB COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am encouraged to hear that. But let me take just one area&mdash;health. There is a popular misconception in the Australian community, supported, I regret to say, by the non-stock contribution of the Prime Minister&mdash;and I am not suggesting for a minute that he is doing this maliciously. The Prime Minister has got no particular reason to have a special understanding of Aboriginal communities. I do not expect him to. He is doing it because he is suffering from the same misconceptions that most other Australians are.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Take the misconception that we spend a zillion dollars more on Aboriginal people, despite their incredibly greater need for the services, than we do on all other Australians. The facts are, for anyone who wants to look at them&mdash;and they have been laid out by the Menzies School of Health Research, which is a research institution of excellence, and in other places as well&mdash;in terms of primary health care, despite the obviously greater need that Aboriginal people have for the services, we spend about the same per capita on Aboriginal people in Australia as we spend on everyone else&mdash;about $700 per capita per year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is one of the reasons for that? No-one ever mentions it. I will tell you why, because of the isolation of many Aboriginal people in this country. I must say that I am pleased that someone is living to the north of this country of ours in a network of small communities, all with radio transceivers, in terms of the national interest, apart from anything else. But one of the reasons for that expenditure is the massive underutilisation by Aboriginal people of Medicare and the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. That is a matter of fact. Because of their isolation, they substantially underutilise the provisions that everyone else utilises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The facts rather than the misconceptions are that, in terms of primary health care, which is the one that is always front and centre in here, despite the substantially greater need <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3763"> that Aboriginal people clearly have for these services that all Australians are entitled to, we spend about the same amount of money per head on Aboriginal primary health care as we do on the primary health care for every other Australian. That is a matter of fact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot of those other myths can be exploded in the same way by simply comparing the quite proper expenditure of public money on the provision of essential services&mdash;sewerage, water supplies, police, nurses and teachers&mdash;to all small isolated communities in Australia, on which we have also spent hundreds of millions of dollars over the early part of this century. No-one, of course, ever puts that in the equation. Somehow or other isolated Aborigines are the only people in Australia who have ever had the need for that money to be spent on them. What nonsense!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ingratitude of these people to still insist on dying from Third World diseases, despite all of the money that we have spent on them! Do you want to know why they are dying? The evidence is there. A major detailed medical research project was recently done on the community of Maningrida in Arnhem Land. It was a detailed nuts and bolts study as to why people are dying early. Do you know why? Because that community which, if it were in rural Australia would probably have two doctors servicing it full time, has got one medical practitioner that visits it for three days a week. That is why.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People suffering from rheumatic heart disease who would, if they lived in urban Australia, be getting a prophylactic dose of penicillin about once a fortnight, I think, for the remainder of their lives to keep them in reasonable health, do not get it at all at Maningrida. Those six patients or however many there are out at Maningrida suffering from that disease who do not get this medication will die early as a result. That is why they are dying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason I make that point is, for those of us who have been around a little longer than others who have recently come to this debate, the nonsense that is perpetrated again and again is that there has been no improvement in this situation over the last 13 years. Let me tell you what an utter falsehood that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is. As bad as the situation is now, and it is, as urgent is the need&mdash;and I think the minister is sincere in his desire to fix it&mdash;to make it better, let me tell you, Minister, it is by quantum leaps better than it was 13 years ago. I do not link that to any particular government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very familiar with the fact that the situation in communities has dramatically improved in respect of the quality of housing, the quality of health care and all the rest of it. Why then, and the minister knows this, do we still have the early mortality? Why is it still happening? Why are Aboriginal adults still dying early? I will tell you why. They are dying from the results of early childhood disease, which marked them out at a very early stage for a short life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My close friend and colleague&mdash;whom I miss badly&mdash;the former member for Arnhem in the Northern Territory's parliament, died tragically at the age of 42 just a short time ago. His medical specialist from Adelaide told me himself that my friend had an enlarged heart as a result of an epidemic of rheumatic fever that went through Arnhem Land when he was four or five years old. He had simply lived with that legacy all his life. His medical specialist said to me&mdash;and I have not forgotten him saying it to me&mdash;that the situation was that he could live for another 10 years with very careful medical treatment or that he could die that afternoon. Both outcomes would be consistent with his medical condition. In other words, it did not matter a damn what improvements we have made in the last 10 or 20 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of that one case&mdash;and it is a case which is symptomatic with many others&mdash;that Aboriginal person was marked out for an early death at the age of five. That simply emphasises again&mdash;and I know the minister is aware of it&mdash;the absolutely vital importance of early intervention in disease in Aboriginal communities. The depressing part is, Minister&mdash;particularly with the addition of things like substance abuse, which is horrific&mdash;that we are continuing to have generations of young Aboriginal people now, whom I know and you know and many others know, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3764"> who are also going to be inevitably marked down for an early death.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is wrong to say that there has been no improvement because of all this money that has been spent. There has, in fact, been a substantial improvement, particularly over the last decade. I might say with some feeling of regret that it is a matter of record also that a substantial increase in the allocation of those funds only occurred in the last four to five years of the previous government. That is the reason it is still happening. It is not because there are not results being gained from the expenditure of that money and not because those Aboriginal people are not entitled to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is, in fact, a very simple health policy for this country, and I commend it to the minister. It is a health policy which, if it were put into effect in real terms, would actually result in a substantial improvement. That health policy should be simply this: all Australians, irrespective of where they live, should to the maximum extent possible have a level of health care commensurate with their needs. It is as simple as that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If that care were provided&mdash;and in many cases I agree, Minister, it would be extremely expensive because of the isolation of those people to provide it&mdash;there would be a dramatic increase in the improvement of the health situation of Aboriginal people. There would be a far greater improvement than there has been over the last 10 years, as encouraging as it has been. But do not take the cheap political position of going to the statistics and saying, `Look at all this money. People are still dying early.' The fact is that they are often dying early because of things that happened generations ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having dealt with that, I say to the Senate again that I intend to tackle a few more of these misconceptions in the Australian community which, to my great regret and sadness, people like the Prime Minister clearly and sincerely believe are true. They are not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me conclude on the matter that was debated yesterday, and that is the minister's foray into the question of the stolen generation and the victims of that particular policy, which was administered by the Commonwealth government of the day under the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Aboriginals Ordinances from 1910 to 1966, I think. That policy, misguided as it was and as horrific as it was in terms of the personal consequences for many of those people, is not yesterday's story. I know other speakers have said that and it is a fact. It is not. It is not something from the dim, dark regions of the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my own family this year a 23-year-old girl&mdash;in fact, my wife's sister's daughter&mdash;was reunited with her mother, after having grown-up with a complete ignorance of her mother. The baby was removed from the mother when she had the baby at the age of 15. No correspondence was entered into. She was packed off down to Santa Teresa in the desert and had the baby. That daughter, whom she pined for and worried about all of her life, grew up in Darwin to the complete ignorance of both herself and her mother. The girl, through her own efforts, finally managed to trace a birth certificate and was reunited with her mother this year at the age of 23. These are not, in fact, very ancient stories at all. Rob Riley has been mentioned, and rightly so.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, and I mentioned this by way of interjection yesterday, last year our government in government&mdash;and I have to say I am pleased I voted for it in cabinet&mdash;paid out substantial damages at long last to the victims of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Voyager</EMPHASIS> disaster, which happened 30 years ago. It is not a fact that the government that paid out the reparations was responsible for the accident that those reparations were <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3765"> paid out for but, of course, it was the only appropriate corporate body that should be and was responsible for those reparations. Aboriginal people are entitled to see it the same way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to conclude with a letter to the editor from yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> that I thought said it all, Minister. It was from Suzanne Midford, a clinical psychologist from Subiaco. I will read it into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> because I think she said it better than I can.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was appalled to read <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS>  . . . the comments of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs Senator Herron on the past practice of forcible removal of Aboriginal children from their families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reality of the policy was extreme psychological and social trauma for the children . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The letter goes on to use this comparison:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">By way of illustration, if a person loses the use of their legs through a trauma s/he may benefit from medical care and wheelchair technology. The person may even benefit from physical training and go on to play a sport&mdash;even go on to the Paralympics! Using Senator Herron's extraordinary logic could it be said that if a person won an Olympic medal that s/he had benefited from their paraplegia?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have to agree with Senator Collins: I am sad that we are debating this issue once again. I really have to say that I think the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) has been given a poisoned chalice by the government, because he is a decent bloke, and I want to put that on the record. I think that he is having a terrible job of carrying the news to Aboriginal people about the bitterness, it seems to me, that this government has towards them. I feel very sad that this minister has been the one who has had to do this job, because I believe that, had the government left him alone to deliver services, he actually would have done that. But the government laid on him its own political agenda and he now is bearing the weight of that. That is a tragedy. </PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nevertheless, the Democrats want to associate themselves with this censure motion as being the only way to send a signal to the government that we want leadership from them in this area. We are not seeing it. The good work that I know the minister is doing is simply being totally counteracted by the failure of the government to address a number of problems in this community which are becoming far more than problems&mdash;in fact, they are becoming the source of great division and  great agony for Aboriginal people, and Asian people as well. They are becoming a source of future real division and real disaster within this community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the debate has already been run and the Democrats believe there is no need to re&hyphen;run all that debate. Certainly the first four clauses in the censure motion have been dealt with in previous debates so I will only comment on those briefly, but I will spend a fair bit of time on clause 5. The first clause of this censure motion is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate censures the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs for his incompetent and insensitive handling of his portfolio in the following areas:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> failure to seek advice or consult before illegally imposing an independent Auditor on ATSIC, and leaving ATSIC responsible for any costs incurred . . . </PARA>
<PARA>We do agree with this part of the censure motion. I believe that the minister could correct this if he would move, and argue in cabinet, for the government to pay the cost of that special auditor. In fact, as has been shown, it was illegal and there is no reason why ATSIC should have to pay between $800,000 and $1 million from its own budget. The questions remain: how many programs could have been run, how many jobs could have been funded and how many community centres could have benefited from this money? Yet it was taken from the budget with no recourse. It was a decision made in haste and without proper consultation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to the actions and lack of words of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). With Senator Collins, I do not believe the Prime Minister is an out&hyphen;and&hyphen;out racist, but I do believe he could have given far greater leadership&mdash;and he must. It will mean nothing <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3766"> to the Australian people if every senator in this place stands up and speaks. It is the leader of the government&mdash;the leader of the people&mdash;who must set an example and clearly indicate that he does not agree with what is happening in our community.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HX5">Senator WOODLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Governor&hyphen;General has done. Thank you, Senator Collins, for reminding me of that. I remind the Senate that the Prime Minister, in his first ever press conference at Parliament House, implied that the indigenous people were crooks and that `we have to expose it all'. This was his theme. As has been proven since, it has set the tone under this government for a fast track backwards in terms of tolerance and reconciliation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe this minister himself believes that all Aborigines are crooks&mdash;in fact, I am sure he does not believe that&mdash;but his government has done little to correct this impression, and it is rife in the community. Every taxi driver you speak to and almost every person on the street is cheering, for they want an enemy to hate. They want a scapegoat upon whom they can lay all the ills of the community. There has been a horrendous increase in these reports. At the weekend the Young Democrats had a conference here in Parliament House. One of them, who is an Aboriginal person, spoke about the personal attacks that he has endured. He is a well&hyphen;educated young Aboriginal person who has really come to wonder whether he belongs to this country or not, because the government has failed to correct what is happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The hardship caused by the decision to appoint the auditor has been shocking for many organisations who lost funding or who had funding reduced. I might point out that, despite the rorting in other government programs, no&hyphen;one has suggested that every person in those programs is defrauding the system, but that has been the result of the failure of the government to correct this impression in the community. No&hyphen;one suggests that in fixing the fraud in other government programs many innocent people should <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> be targeted, but this is the result: this is what has happened to Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second clause in the censure motion seeks to censure the minister for seeking to make changes to eligibility criteria, et cetera. I want to say that the potential was there for threatening the validity of the ATSIC election, but I believe the minister did correct that. The relevant clauses were withdrawn and we acknowledge that, Minister. That was an appropriate action.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The inability to comprehend the outcomes of his own decisions which impact on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health, education, employment, social cohesion and self&hyphen;determination.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, I want to underline that the Democrats believe, with great sadness, that this is the issue. I believe the minister is working flat out to correct that and I commend him for that. But let me say to you that it has had an awful impact on Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us understand the original purpose of the CDEP. I remember, many years ago, visiting one of the first instances of this program having been put in place, in the Aboriginal communities of Ernabella and Fregon in the north of South Australia. A very wonderful Uniting Church deaconess, Win Hilliard, was involved in that program. Not only did the Aboriginal people benefit from the welfare payments which were paid through the CDEP; some of the profits from the craft shop also went into the program to be distributed to the community. What the minister and the government need to understand is that taking away funding for those programs is taking away money to which the people were entitled and which all other Australians are able to access. This action has deprived them of this money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To help the Senate understand the impact of what we are doing to Aboriginal people in Australia, I might read an essay written by an Aboriginal boy quite some years ago, in the 1960s, when I was the Methodist minister in Mitchell&mdash;his teacher gave me this. This was an Aboriginal boy who wanted to be a doctor. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3767"> He had the intelligence to get there but he did not make it because of the problems which he faced in those days. What I want to underline is that the Aboriginal people have come a long way in 30 years. They have done it mostly by their own efforts, but with some help from the Australian community. We need to understand that Aboriginal people want to make a contribution to this country but they cannot make it if they feel that they are constantly being excluded. Let me read the essay&mdash;at the time he was in grade 7:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The situation of my home is east Mitchell . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That was on the other side of the Maranoa River from the main township of Mitchell. He lived in one of the fringe camps of those days. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I live beside the Forest Vale Road. It has no name for we live in the bush not far from town.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My farther built the house out of tin and it is not a very good house, for he didn't build it on a slant and therefore when it rains the water stays in the middle and it leaks.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I help him to construct the house while mum prepared the tin.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We do not know the size of it for it is in a rectangular form. Our interior is not good for we have newspaper on the wall, to keep the wind from coming through the cracks, in the wall.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Also our home is envirous with sand and therefore we can't make ours look beautiful. Flowers will not grow because it is sandy and dry. Although we have no electricity or water layed on we have a kerosene lantern and we pay Mr Morgan five shillings to carry us some water. He carries the water in five gallon drums.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Maintening our house is easy for us. We don't do anything to our house only when it rain and we put tar where it leak or put chewing gum in the hole from which the water is coming.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At home, we don't have room for we only have one rectangular room, in the corner is a double bed where Michal and I sleep. Mum and Dad sleep under a half a tank with a bit of tent over their head. For pets we have eight ducks, seven dogs, and four cats. From the ducks we have fine eggs and the cats keep the snakes away.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well I've told you of my home. I know it not much of a home but to me it is therefore I will always call it my home.</PARA>
<PARA>That story tells us two things. One is that the people of the Yumba camp have all gone from there now and they live in the main township. That is the good news. The bad <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> news is that there are still hundreds and thousands of Aboriginal people living in camps where the same description would apply. Minister, we live in a community which, indeed, is able to repair some of these stories. It is not something that happened in the past; we have a task to do today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth issue which was raised in the censure motion was the promotion of inappropriate and outdated policies of assimilation. I must say I was disappointed that the minister promoted the book about Hasluck's assimilation policies. I know the minister gets hundreds of invitations and he has to make choices about what he will or will not promote. I believe it was a deliberate and bad choice to launch the book, but it does give us an understanding, by default, of the thinking of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To say that many indigenous people benefited from being forcibly removed from their families is to support one of the cornerstones of assimilation. It is a remark which has brought pain to many people and has put a spin on the outcome of the stolen generation inquiry which was unnecessary and just wrong. I have spent 35 years living, working and struggling with Aboriginal people within Aboriginal communities. I helped set up the Aboriginal child&hyphen;care agency in Brisbane&mdash;and I must say that working with those people to recover some of those children was a very poignant and telling experience for me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to the fifth clause in the censure motion. In some ways, I do not think this should be directed as much to the minister as to the Prime Minister because I underline again that the failure to correct the impression being left in this community in fact is making Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people into scapegoats. The phenomenon of scapegoating has a long and inglorious history. Through the centuries, people have been made scapegoats where a minority group which is easily identifiable and living on the edge of society is accused of being the basis for all that is wrong in that society. In times of social instability, the rise of scapegoating is something which we can note in history and something about which we ought to be really concerned.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3768">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The creation of an enemy&mdash;where a group of people is identified, then vilified, then brutalised and finally eliminated as a public service&mdash;has historical precedents which, I think, give all of us pause. I would like to underline that by pointing out that the story of scapegoating, or the whole idea of scapegoating, has a very long history. It really comes out of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Old Testament</EMPHASIS>. It is a story that comes out of an ancient Jewish ritual. In Leviticus 16, on the day of atonement, a goat was paraded in front of the tabernacle. The sins of the people were laid on the head of the goat by the priest. The goat was taken into the desert and released, presumably to starve to death. Its fate was of no further concern to the people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thus, in our modern culture, a scapegoat is one identified in the mind of the community as a focus for all that is wrong with society. It is vilified as one to whom the blame for all the community's ills can be attributed. It is cast out to the edges of society where its fate is of no further concern because the community has laid on its head all of that community's guilt and responsibility. That process is happening and many people in the Australian community are endorsing that very action and that process. We need, from this government, a very strong statement to the contrary so that we can say that this is not on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It sounds depressingly familiar as we recount the ancient story. It is not so much an ancient Jewish ritual as it is a modern political parable, except that we are not talking about casting out symbolic goats to wander around in the desert: we are talking about the lives and the future of real people, real Australians. We are talking about laying on the heads of Aboriginal Australians, in particular, the failure of our society to deliver a fair deal to all of its citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I trust that the Senate will pass this censure motion so that we can get a new direction from this government and clearly hear that they do not support this process and that, in the end, they will agree that those who are most disadvantaged in our community have the right to expect from its government a far better deal than they have been getting.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will respond seriatim to the censure motion and go through it point by point. I vigorously respond, and I will detail in my response the fact that all of these points can be adequately refuted. In relation to clause 1, the special auditor process and the independent auditor, the government stated that it was committed to accountability. We will not step back from that process of accountability or from the fact that we did appoint a special auditor.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that the special auditor process has been extremely worth while, and, interestingly enough, so does ATSIC. The ATSIC chief executive officer has written to the government indicating that the special auditor process has been of considerable value and will be used to help to decide future funding determinations. The background was the Federal Court decision that the general direction establishing a special auditor was too specific. It was the first time a general direction had been used. It was new territory and the court challenge was the first time general directions had been tested.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Legal advice is, in fact, that the decision could be appealed but, as the audit process was virtually complete, there seemed little point, and a great deal of taxpayers' money would be spent through the legislative process. I saw no point in doing that when it was virtually completed at the time the court decision was handed down, so I did not proceed along that process. At the time of the special court decision, 95 per cent of the special auditor process had been completed. ATSIC agreed to complete the process and used the material gathered by the special auditor to assist in funding decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are still awaiting the final report from the special auditor; I hope to table it today or tomorrow. The preliminary report shows that the special auditor has found that 19 per cent of all organisations funded by ATSIC were in serious breach of grant conditions and 60 organisations which received $27.8 million in their last ATSIC grant should be declared not fit and proper and de&hyphen;funded. At the time of the court decision, the special auditor was <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3769"> seeking additional information on a further 130 organisations that received $89.6 million in their latest funding. Of these organisations, the special auditor says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is the potential for some or all to be declared not fit and proper.</PARA>
<PARA>The special auditor has found that a further 184 organisations were in such serious breach of grant conditions that they require immediate and close attention. They received a total of $124 million in their latest funding. Altogether, that is a total of 374 of the 1,300 organisations funded by ATSIC in serious breach and either not fit and proper or requiring close and immediate attention. Those 374 organisations received a total of $241 million in their latest ATSIC grants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of the special auditor process, ATSIC has implemented tighter internal funding requirements. Senator Margetts said `some blunder'&mdash;when we have the special auditor reporting on that volume of money that has been found and will be found as a result of this process. As I said, ATSIC itself is adopting the procedures to tighten this up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The initial cost of the special auditor was expected to be around $750,000. That figure was based on an estimate that 60 per cent of ATSIC funded organisations would be in compliance with their grant conditions. In fact, less than 20 per cent were in compliance, which increased substantially the number of organisations requiring close examination; therefore, the cost increased. The final cost is still to be settled on, but it is expected to be in excess of $1 million. ATSIC budgeted $1.2 million for the special auditor and the money is from running costs, not from the programs, which is another essential point that needs to be made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, the special auditor process has forced the 80 per cent of organisations classified as amber into compliance and others in serious breach to either undergo substantial remedial action or lose their funding. For the first time, and as a direct result of the special auditor process, we will be able to move forward with confidence from a baseline that sees all ATSIC funded organisations either in full compliance or undertaking changes to bring them into full compliance.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think those facts completely refute the first part of the censure motion. I have no doubt it will be accepted by the Senate itself as being a complete travesty that that first part of the censure motion should be proposed in the light of the figures I have just released.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second part of the censure motion was seeking to make changes to eligibility. This is even better hypocrisy on their behalf. I thank Senator Woodley for pointing it out to the Greens, who moved this motion. The second part of the motion reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . seeking to make changes to eligibility criteria for an ATSIC election which would come into effect after nominations had closed for that election, potentially threatening the validity of that election, thus incurring millions of dollars of additional costs for ATSIC;</PARA>
<PARA>I am not sure where Senator Margetts was when the ATSIC amendments passed the Senate, but the government moved to remove the eligibility criteria from the amendments. The eligibility criteria were there because government had hoped to pass amendments back in June when first introduced, well in advance of the ATSIC election. There was never any threat to the election process. The government was in full agreement with the removal of these provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not really know what Senator Margetts is about. We did remove them and now she comes in with a censure motion that I sought to make changes to eligibility criteria, et cetera. The eligibility criteria are not there. They certainly did not add any additional cost to ATSIC and did not threaten the validity of the election. The government's legal advice at the time was that the provision changing the eligibility rules for the current ATSIC election would not have threatened the legal validity of the election. So point No. 2 is knocked out of the ring. Let us move to point No. 3. Point No. 3 of the motion states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The inability to comprehend the outcomes of his own decisions which impact on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health, education, employment, social cohesion and self&hyphen;determination.</PARA>
<PARA>I am more than aware of the outcomes of the decisions of this government&mdash;more than anyone in this chamber, including Senator Margetts, and Senator Brown I might say. After traversing the length and breadth of this <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3770"> land over the last seven months, never have I heard their names mentioned or seen them physically in any of the remote Aboriginal communities in this country. They may well have been there, but virtually every moment that this chamber has not been sitting I have been traversing this country and I would have thought that at some stage I would have come across them. I have come across the members of the opposition around the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I talk to indigenous people and ask their opinions on what action needs to be taken, I find that what is offered is at complete variance with what I hear in this chamber. Last Wednesday I spoke to the Central Land Council, 120 kilometres north of Tennant Creek and 80 Aboriginal traditional owners there. They were at complete variance with what I hear in this chamber. I am actually out speaking to people in the communities and listening to their concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last seven months I have visited more than 50 communities. I can tell you that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in those communities are pleased and relieved that at last a government is taking action to improve health, education and employment conditions for indigenous Australians, which is what we quarantined in the budget so that the money would go there. Total Commonwealth spend on indigenous specific programs for 1996-97 will be $1.6 billion, the second highest amount on record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, Senator Margetts, you are the ones that have failed to comprehend. You do not comprehend that there is a new government in office. You have failed to comprehend that the policies of the past 13 years have been an unqualified failure in the very respects you are pointing out. I take Senator Bob Collins's point and I support him in that: there is a lot of ignorance out in the wider community because they do not have the privilege to go out. You have no excuse. You as senators could travel around, but the general community does not have the opportunity to go around these remote communities and talk to these people. You fail to comprehend that that has occurred. I welcome you to come along so that you can meet these people and not be <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> listening to what you are hearing in this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Greens fail to comprehend that this government will not play the politically correct game if it means that Aboriginal people on the ground in remote communities continue to miss out, which is what they have been doing. They fail to comprehend that this government is about achieving real outcomes for indigenous Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are 300,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Australia, fewer than 100,000 adults. In the past 12 years, over $16,000 million has been spent on indigenous specific programs, and I welcome that. As Senator Collins said, it has been only belatedly in the last four or five years that that has increased. Despite that increase, indigenous Australians still have an infant mortality rate two to three times that of non-indigenous Australians, a life expectancy up to 18 years less than non-indigenous Australians, adult diabetes at four times the rate for non-indigenous Australians and falling education standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those opposite would have us continue those same failed policies. We are not going to do that. Instead, we have embarked on policies that will deliver real outcomes. Despite the savings within the ATSIC budget, during the next four years the Commonwealth will spend in today's dollar terms $428 million more on indigenous specific programs than was spent during the last four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you listened to the rhetoric of this chamber, you would think it was the end of the world that these dramatic cuts were occurring. The fact is that savings have been made in the ATSIC budget, but we have increased the funding in health care and in education for the next four years specifically for the very reasons that Senator Brown was decrying. We are doing that, Senator Brown, and I wish you would read the debate and read the budget papers to see that it is occurring. We are spending an additional $97 million on indigenous health in the next four years. We are spending an additional $26 million on the community housing and infrastructure program. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3771">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am delighted that the week before last I went with the minister responsible for housing, Senator Newman, to a conference and we got the states to agree on indigenous housing. I thank Senator Newman for inviting me to that conference in Darwin of all the state housing ministers. There was general agreement that the funding would be put together from the states and the Commonwealth and that indigenous housing would be specifically approached. For the first time, Senator Brown, indigenous specific funding will go to indigenous people with regard to housing. It was a move by Senator Newman, which was totally supported by me. I thank her for the invitation to attend, and I thank the state ministers for housing for agreeing to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We put a press release out on that matter, but it did not get a run. It never got a mention. I am sorry, Senator, you probably were not aware of that event because it did not get a run in the media. Good news does not get a run in the media.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to housing, we are spending an extra $337 million on the community development employment programs&mdash;CDEP. An additional $147 million will be spent on the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs to run indigenous education and training programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will say it again, and I will keep saying it until it gets through the minds of those opposite: extra funding is going into health, education, housing and the work for the dole scheme. That is going in. That is in the budget papers. I hope you can pay a little attention to them so you do not come in here making these statements in relation to the third item.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have successfully negotiated bilateral health agreements with the states and territories, which will see improved outcomes for indigenous Australians. I thank my colleague the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) for negotiating those, and nearly all the states and territories have signed up on them. They are very positive achievements, and they will achieve outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have gained an agreement, as I mentioned, with housing. Finally&mdash;and I put this clause in&mdash;indigenous Australians themselves <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have control and will be consulted in relation to housing. Senator Woodley is a bit behind the pace, and I can understand that too because he was probably not aware of that fact as it did not get any reportage. The very first clause of that agreement is that indigenous people be consulted and have control over the expenditure of funding in relation to housing. As I mentioned, I am grateful to the housing ministers for getting that through. That is your point No. 3.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VW4">Senator HERRON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is three&hyphen;nil. Let us go to item No. 4&mdash;the promotion of inappropriate and outdated policies of assimilation. I would like you to show me where I have promoted assimilation. The best that you could level at me was that I launched a book here. I presume that is what you are referring to. I have never promoted assimilation&mdash;never. I would like you to show me otherwise anywhere on the record. I know that I have not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did launch a book. Senator Woodley was kind enough to say that I do receive many invitations to launch things. It was a book expressing views, and I stated when I launched it that I did not agree with it. I made it perfectly clear at the launch, and have done so on numerous occasions since then. Where have you been, Senator Margetts? Where have you been, Senator Brown? Did you not see that? If I were to launch a book on the recent history of China, would that mean I supported communism? That is your implication. The government is on record as opposing assimilation policies. They are the policies of the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also do not agree with book burning. I happen to love books. I was on the library committee here from the first day I was in. I believe in promoting knowledge, promoting debate and promoting reading. If we followed your mentality, we would burn the books and try to confine information so it was only divulged along one political line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not about book burning and I will not censor or edit Australia's history. It is a fact of history. We must look at the past to learn from the mistakes and ensure that they are not repeated. To ignore the past and the mistakes that occurred is to try to pretend that what <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3772"> happened then did not really happen. I am not prepared to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is about greater self&hyphen;management for indigenous Australians. It is about encouraging indigenous Australians to take hold of their own destiny and work towards greater independence at all levels. That is why we have committed most of the $428 million increase in indigenous spending over the next four years to the areas of health, housing, education and training. Without real outcomes in those areas, self-determination will mean little. It is a nonsense to suggest this government is pursuing assimilation policies. I will say again, and I have done so repeatedly over the last few months, that I do not endorse assimilation policies and never have done so. So that is four&hyphen;nil.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us go to point No. 5 of the motion, the final one. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the willingness to allow Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to be made scapegoats to deflect attention from issues of unemployment and growing inequalities in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>This government is committed to improving outcomes for indigenous people, unlike its predecessors, and in the just over seven months that we have been in government we have taken major steps towards this goal. The Labor government was in office for 13 years and there were some improvements, as Senator Collins has noted&mdash;I agree with him in that regard&mdash;but there is still an enormous amount to be done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have taken immediate action to ensure that funds are getting through to Aboriginal people in the communities and they are not going to be unnecessarily wasted on rorts and bureaucracy. Senator Margetts and her colleagues should spend more time visiting Aboriginal communities because people out there are telling me that they are supporting what the government is doing and that it has been long overdue. It is the negative sorts of politically correct statements, such as those made by Senator Margetts here today, that undermine the reconciliation process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government will not sit around and watch the  further destruction of Aboriginal communities through neglect. The previous government wooed Aboriginal people with <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> false promises. We remember Graham Richardson going out into the communities. He regarded them as great photo opportunities. I am going to go back to that community and I will report back to the Senate what occurred as a result of that. I suspect I know the answer already because I have done a little preliminary investigation. But I will produce the facts, not just empty rhetoric.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, Mick Dodson&mdash;certainly not one of my wildest supporters&mdash;in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> of 23 September 1996 launched an attack on the Labor Party and former Prime Minister Bob Hawke, saying that they had done little to advance the indigenous cause. That was in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian </EMPHASIS>of 23 September 1996, which Senator Margetts should review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will not repeat this pattern. To say that we are allowing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to be made scapegoats to deflect attention from other issues is ridiculous and highly divisive. We are not going to function in the looney left paradigm of the past. This government is working to the empowerment of Aboriginal people and their recognition as equals in a just society. Equality of opportunity, equality of education and equality in health care and housing is the emphasis of this government. We do not believe that they should be locked into the politics and the rhetoric of the past, where they were government dependent. We believe in economic independence and pride in Aboriginality and protection of culture, not in government dependence, which is the paradigm of the opposition and the looney left. We are not committed to that at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank Senator Collins because he made some constructive remarks in relation to health. But I suppose in a sense he said he was doing it more in sorrow than in anger. I can understand that because I look back to 5 May 1993 and the headlines of the day&mdash;`Collins should resign', `Collins, the minister for the pay TV fiasco' and `Cabinet had four chances over two years to reject the new system and wrecked it'. I suppose he has a sense of deja vu, but he did make some constructive comments.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3773">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was up at the Menzies School of Health Research last week. It is funny; life is interesting. I was on the committee that made the decision for the Menzies Foundation&mdash;I was the inaugural Queensland chairman of it&mdash;to devote funds for the establishment of the Menzies school for tropical health and research in Darwin. I launched the acute rheumatic fever booklet, but we have heard not a word. It is true that Aboriginals have a lot of problems in relation to health. They are related to low birth weight and immunity. Nobody knows why, but by the time an Aboriginal child is nine months of age, they are colonised with bacteria and their immune system is deficient because of the low birth weight. There are a lot of problems associated with Aboriginal health. We cannot blame that on the conditions that are there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Collins mentioned the CDEP. He asked the following question on notice:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is it a fact that KPMG Peat Marwick must advise of any conflict of any interest before a replacement special auditor is appointed; if so, what has been the extent of any time delays which have occurred in having a special auditor begin work on affected organisations . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The answer was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">KPMG must obtain the Commonwealth's permission . . . The Commonwealth has not been advised of any delays in having the alternate Special Auditor beginning work on affected organisations.</PARA>
<PARA>The second question he asked was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Has this resulted in delays to Community Development and Employment Projects (CDEP) payments from ATSIC to any organisations; if so, how many, and are those delays still occurring?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer was no. Did he come back to the Senate and tell us&mdash;that was the part of the last censure motion, if you recall&mdash;about these terrible delays that were resulting in CDEP payments? Of course he did not come back and apologise to the Senate for misleading us, which is what he did at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank Senator Woodley. Like Senator Woodley, I will not introduce personality into this. It is not, as Senator Woodley said, that I have been sold a dump. I regard this as a wonderful opportunity. It is the most wonderful portfolio to have. I have had the opportunity to meet some outstanding Aboriginal leaders in this country&mdash;not the ones you read <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> about in the papers every day but, for example, the Yirrkala business enterprises who have a contract from Comalco for $60 million over the next 20 years to transport alumina to the plant up at Nhulunbuy. Do we hear about that? No, not a word. There are outstanding Aboriginal people. I invite Senator Margetts and Senator Brown to come with me next time and I will introduce them to these people so that they can meet the true leaders of the Aboriginal community who are working towards economic dependence and who are not locked into the politics  and rhetoric of the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refute this censure motion. I believe that any honest minded senator would not support this censure motion.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are obviously a number of points that have been canvassed in today's debate. Most of it has been a very sad debate. Whatever the outcome of today's debate, it has been important for these issues to be canvassed and is important for the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) and the government to see that the parliament and the community are watching and that they do not swallow the kind of statements and attitudes that are coming out from this government via decisions that are being made by this minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Point No. 1 of the motion said that there was a failure to seek proper advice or consult before imposing an independent auditor on ATSIC. That is what the courts clearly said. It was a unanimous decision. Whatever the outcomes of the audit, there are provisions within ATSIC for that audit to take place. The problem was the failure to consult and get proper advice before that action took place. Whatever people have said about the outcomes of the auditor, they do not address the situation that proper advice was not sought and proper consultation did not take place before that decision took place. Ministers should not act in that way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to point No. 2, the fact that the change was made to the bill on the day in the chamber was the result of advice given by the Greens to the minister. Yes, the minister withdrew it. I obviously know that&mdash; <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3774">everybody knows that&mdash;because, despite the preliminary and inadequate advice the minister received, the information that the minister gave me that there was no problem did not constitute a legal advice. It was simply an advice from the Electoral Commission that such an election could take place within the time specified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, whilst the minister says, `I received advice that it was okay,' he clearly knows that that advice was not a legal opinion and did not comment in any way upon whether or not such a move would make or would not make the election ineligible. Of course, most of those issues would require a court challenge to establish that absolutely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That does not change the fact that the minister did seek to make changes. There is nothing at all that the minister can say to indicate that he did not seek to make changes to the eligibility criteria for the ATSIC election. Of all the people looking at the bill, if it requires the Greens at the last minute to save $4.7 million, then it should be acknowledged it was on the basis of that decision. It was because of incompetence on the part of a number of people, including perhaps department and minister, that that situation got that far.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Point No. 3 relates to health, education, employment, and so on. The minister said, `I have not seen the Greens in remote communities.' In the last five weeks I have been speaking to Aboriginal people in Darwin, Jabiru, Alice Springs, Uluru&mdash;</PARA>

I refer the minister to the three 5.1 per cent increases in health insurance premiums put forward by the National Mutual subsidiaries. How many further applications for insurance premium rises are pending; and is it not a fact that the health insurance rebates are now practically worthless as a result of these premium increases?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The detail of the senator's question obviously makes it one for the minister responsible, Mr Wooldridge. The number of applications that have been flowing through the system for an increase in private health insurance premiums is a direct result of the previous government's failure to take action to encourage people to stay in private health insurance. I well remember when I was the shadow minister for health and the then Senator Richardson was keenly trying to do something to encourage private health insurance. But he was stamped on from a great height by his Prime Minister Mr Keating. So precious years were wasted while action could have been taken to make private health insurance more attractive to Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The present government, as soon as it had the opportunity in its first budget, announced the measures which are going to be implemented to encourage people to stay in private health insurance. The Labor opposition, I gather, has got some sort of mean&hyphen;spirited approach to this, that it does not believe Australians should get assistance in terms of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3775"> affordability of private health insurance. If that is their ideological stance, it suggests that they are going even further to the left than they have been in the past. That will be a great shame if it means that older Australians who desperately want to stay in private health insurance are prevented from affording it and that families, with children particularly, will find it difficult.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You may be aware, Madam President, that the Minister for Health and Family Services just recently has been talking to the health funds, trying to encourage them to introduce new and innovative measures which will make the opportunity for private health insurance more attractive to special elements of the community. I will be very happy to get any details which the minister is able at this stage to give me. I am not, of course, going to be in a position to bring an answer back to the Senate which predicts which health funds might have applications pending because, as you would know, Madam President, health funds are only able to get confirmation of their applications for an increase in private health insurance where their reserves have dropped to such a level that they need support through extra funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation is that, as more and more people drop out of private health insurance, the pressures on the reserves of those funds grow greater. So, for each year that no action was taken, the problem has grown greater and greater and greater. While there can be the odd bit of mirth and interjection from the other side, they know full well where the guilty party is because we would not be facing this problem, this pressure on Medicare by the failure of people who can afford it to take up private health insurance&mdash;people like the Keating family.</PARA>

In the social security area this is one matter that we have undertaken. It has been well received by employers.

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Ian Macdonald for that question and for the keen appreciation he shows and his recognition, as I hope all Australians recognise, of the need to take pressure off interest rates. The government is committed to delivering an interest rate environment which provides significant material benefit to all Australian families and small businesses. That is in stark contrast to the record of the previous Labor government whose interest rate policies as a result of overall economic incompetence forced thousands and thousands of small businesses into bankruptcy and imposed enormous hardships and burdens on most Australian families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are absolutely committed to taking pressure off interest rates. Under Labor, Australia had amongst the highest interest rates in the world. We had the second highest prime interest rate of any of the OECD countries, the western countries, and higher interest rates than most other of our major trading and competitor countries. In one four&hyphen;month period alone under Labor, interest rates in Australia rose by no less than three per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A key cause of that was Labor's failure to run responsible prudent fiscal policy. By running up huge deficits, $70 billion worth of deficits over a five&hyphen;year period alone, which left an inheritance for the new incoming government of $100 billion, Labor failed to tackle our No. 1 problem&mdash;a shortage of national savings. By failing to tackle that national savings problem, they failed to take pressure off interest rates and put pressure on interest rates to be much higher than they should have otherwise been.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moreover, during Labor's term in office, they presided over two downgradings to our international credit rating which further increases the cost of borrowing by Australia overseas. Our budget strategy will return the budget to balance over the next three years. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> By doing that, we will directly boost public and national savings. Increased national savings equals less pressure on interest rates. It is a very simple equation which Labor never seems to have been able to come to grips with. That means that families struggling to pay off a mortgage will benefit from lower repayments. It means that businesses pay less interest on business loans, helping them to expand, helping the economy to grow faster, helping to create more jobs throughout the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Macdonald also asked me about the critical importance to the economy of getting this budget passed in full. I want to stress this. Let there be no mistake at all about this that any diminution of the government's fiscal consolidation strategy risks putting more pressure on interest rates. The budget should have been in surplus in 1995-96 if the former government was serious about Australian families and business. Instead it was in deficit by $10 billion and when they left office, as I said, it was $100 billion. The Australian people have had to pay very heavily for this fiscal incompetence and are well aware of it. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is an interjection from Senator Carr, `Unlike ministers'. He must be speaking from experience of Labor ministers. Nonetheless, I simply made the point that the debate on higher education has been anything but a search for truth and anything but a spread of knowledge into the community. It has not, in fact, left the community properly informed about that which the government intends to do. If you, Senator, believe in a participatory democracy, you must believe that for voters to cast their vote it must be on the basis of what has actually happened: the truth. There is, therefore, a very strong interest in the truth being told.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I said was that there were people in the higher education sector and others&mdash;and I include people on the other side in this bracket&mdash;who want to create the impression that we have cut $1.8 billion out of higher education. You know, Senator, that that is not true, but I have not heard you get up and tell your colleagues that they are misleading this chamber and they are misleading the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth of the matter is that the real cuts to higher education are something in the vicinity of $689 million over four years, and that is against $20 billion in expenditure. I <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3781"> tried to make it very clear in that speech that I am happy to have a discussion about the need to make those savings. A one per cent cut against growth estimates next year is not something that universities will be unable to cope with. A three per cent cut the following year is a very small cut, compared with what some other portions of the community have had to bear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am happy to have a debate about whether it is right and proper that we shift to a differentiated HECS. I am happy for you to take the case that doctors should pay the same as teachers for an education which costs more and gives them more. If that is the position you want to take, that is entirely up to you. I am happy to have that debate. What I do not think does this place any credit, what does not do the higher education sector any credit, and what does not do any sections of the media that feed on this misunderstanding any credit, is to create the impression in the community that $1.8 billion is being taken out of higher education when that is simply not true.

Is it correct that, of the 50,000 Chinese students who came to Australia during the late 1980s and early 1990s, there remains a group of about 4,000 who were not granted permanent residency status and whose futures are still uncertain?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Colston's questions relate to a number of people who have sought permanent residence in Australia and are referred to as the 1 November caseload. The majority of those cases are from the People's Republic of China. All but 500 to 600 of those people have had their cases finalised; 41,527 people&mdash;mainly from the PRC&mdash;have been granted permanent residence in Australia; and 2,641 applications covering 3,129 persons from the PRC have been refused. Those applicants who have been unsuccessful and who seek a review of their decision will take longer, of course, to have their cases finalised.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is aware that many of those who have been unsuccessful have been in Australia for a considerable period of time. We are concerned, and have been for some time&mdash;including before we were in government&mdash;about the length of time taken to finalise their situation. During the recent election both major parties indicated that the situation of those PRC students who failed to benefit from the 1 November 1993 decision would be examined. The coalition stated that it would resolve the matter satisfactorily.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Discussions have been held with representatives of the Chinese students and the Chinese community since the election in both May and July of this year on the students' situation. The government has not, as yet, come to a concluded view on the matter. When we have come to such a concluded view on a satisfactory basis&mdash;which I hope will be a view that we can communicate sooner rather than later&mdash;the people concerned will, of course, be advised.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The dispute between claimants became an absolute fiasco in the gas pipeline project in Queensland. Even when a legitimate claim was recognised, there was uncertainty as to just what the negotiations were about. Was it the right to transgress or hunt, was it the right to occupy or was it a type of freehold? On what basis could compensation even be considered, let alone determined? Quite clearly, the act was not workable and my colleague Senator Minchin was given the job to consult, which he has done widely for months. He has consulted with Aboriginals, land councils, graziers, miners and state governments. And, I might say, Senator Minchin has done a magnificent job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The right to negotiate process will be streamlined by a number of amendments, including making it clear that the right to negotiate can run parallel with state approval processes, improving the process for excluding activities such as exploration and prospecting, providing for more specific criteria to be followed by arbitral bodies, allowing for earlier intervention by the minister in exceptional cases during the right to negotiate process and prior to an arbitral determination to allow future acts which make up a project to be dealt with together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments also set up a statutory framework for representative Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander bodies which will improve their functioning and assist in streamlining the native title process. They will improve the quality of service provided to native title holders and claimants in the representative bodies' geographical areas and ensure accountability for the representative bodies' constituents and for the expenditure of public funds. The amendments include a voluntary agreement process that will provide greater flexibility to both indigenous and industry groups. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Parer), to a question without notice asked by Senator Eggleston today, relating to proposed amendments to the Native Title Act.</PARA>
<PARA>The question of native title has been one of the most important matters which has been brought before this Senate since federation. In fact, it was in this chamber that there was, I think, the longest debate in this country's history on that bill. At the time, coalition senators said that this bill was unworkable and history has proved it to be so. In fact, we have in excess of 380 claims across Australia. Forty per cent of the continent is under claim, yet no native title has been found. Satisfaction has not been found by indigenous people, developers, pastoralists, miners or people in industry. In fact, to date I would put to the Senate that the bill has been a disaster.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With these amendments, the government is intending to make the bill workable. I say to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> fellow senators, the Australian community and, in particular, members of the press: beware of anyone who criticises these amendments as being racist, beware of anyone who uses labels in this argument, beware of people who seek to attack the person in this argument because that would signify that they have lost the argument themselves. Too many people in this debate would try to argue it on emotive terms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to look at this bill in an analytical fashion. We have to make the bill work. We have to amend the process whereby justice is meted out to all and, most importantly, where results will be achieved. To date, there have been a lot of complaints from industry and Aboriginal communities that there has been too much delay, that this whole process has become bogged down. Time and time again, senators from both the opposition and the government have said that lawyers have been the only ones to benefit from this native title process. I would put it to the Senate that these amendments go a long way to streamlining the process to make it workable and to cut out the role of lawyers who have enjoyed the proceeds from this process thus far.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When one looks at the right to negotiate one will see that it is possible on one project to have several rights to negotiate. That is in no-one's interests. Therefore, the amendment which proposes that you have one right to negotiate in relation to a project as a whole is a thoroughly sensible one. The amendment which says that you can deal with native title processes as well as state approval processes for a development is a thoroughly sensible one. The situation at present is that you have to go through state processes and only after that embark on native title processes. That gives you a cumulative effect which can take years before any decision is made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As has been said by members of the opposition and the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron), there is a lot to be said for economic development in remote areas for Aboriginal Australia. In areas where there have been developments not only in the tourist industry but also in the mining industry, we have seen that Aboriginal Australia has benefited. It is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3789"> by this process of facilitating development and taking native title rights into account at the same time and on an even balance that you can see how this framework can possibly work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one other aspect I would commend&mdash;that is, the question of voluntary agreements, which Senator Parer referred to. The question of voluntary agreements has been a vexed one. People have wanted to come to an agreement, but they have been unable to because the system will not let them have an agreement which can work with any efficacy or certainty. This proposal by the government will allow a voluntary agreement to be registered. I think that is a step in the right direction. Of course, it is a complicated area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments will have to deal with a rather complex proposal where people who want to form an agreement in relation to native title will come together. Nonetheless, this government has not shied away from addressing this most complex area, something which the former government shied away from completely. The only amendments we had were in relation to the High Court decision of Brandy, which was foist upon the former government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is addressing this complex problem head-on. That is a courageous effort on behalf of the government. I compliment Senator Minchin on his excellent work and consultation, which I might say has been extensive. That is a lot more than we can say for the Native Title Bill. Senator Cooney would remember the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs had seven days and an air force jet to go around this vast continent and consult with the whole of the country as to the whole of the Native Title Bill. We have had, I would submit, consultation which would be at least tenfold higher than that, and that is just in relation to some amendments to the bill.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Look at the section on page 3 of these amendments&mdash;this is one of the crucial ones&mdash;that is headed `Early ministerial intervention in the national interest'. This is one of the red&hyphen;hot ones. According to the press, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs&mdash;it made out exactly the case I made out this morning&mdash;is not an advocate for the Aboriginal people of Australia; he is an advocate for the government to them. The minister for Aboriginal affairs is going to get the job of overriding Aboriginal opinion, but under what circumstances can the minister do so? Read the government's paper. Under the heading `Early ministerial intervention in the national interest' it says that where native title <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> holders determine they do not want a development and that it should not go ahead, the minister can ministerially intervene and order it to go ahead. Under what circumstances? He can do it when:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the act is of `substantial economic benefit to Australia';</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> if the determination is not made at the time, that benefit will be substantially reduced or will not arise;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> if the act is done, there will be significant benefits to native title holders.</PARA>
<PARA>Can you believe that? It is the first time I have seen paternalism legislated for in black and white, and it is happening in 1996. In other words, they are saying that the great white father, the federal minister for Aboriginal affairs, the protector of Aborigines&mdash;that is how the government sees Senator Herron; it is certainly how the Prime Minister sees him&mdash;can determine that they will receive significant benefits from the mine. Some Aboriginal people in Kakadu National Park have determined&mdash;they met with me last week as a matter of fact&mdash;that because of the disruption that is currently being caused out there, rightly or wrongly, in terms of their community, they do not want mining to proceed. That is their view as a community. They are the people who actually live and experience these things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The federal minister for Aboriginal affairs in 1996 can overturn their decision in their interests. The minister for Aboriginal affairs can determine that they do in fact receive significant benefits from the mine. They do not know their own minds; they do not know what is best for them! He can put that aside. I could not believe this when I read it in the government's paper yesterday. It is legislated paternalism and it is utterly contemptible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to Senator Minchin and Senator Ellison that I would predict safely&mdash;it is hard to predict things in here, as we all know, but I am prepared to take a punt on this&mdash;that whatever else might pass through the Senate, and a great deal of this no doubt will, this particular obnoxious provision that the minister for Aboriginal affairs can supplant the views of the Aboriginal people themselves <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3791"> as to what is in their interests will be, if nothing else, rejected by this chamber.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make a few comments in relation to this motion. I would like to join Senator Ellison in congratulating Senator Minchin on undertaking a genuine consultation process, which I believe commenced only a few days after Senator Minchin was sworn in as a parliamentary secretary. It is in absolutely stark contrast to the processes that were undertaken by the previous government, where they basically did not involve the state governments or the mining industry. They involved but a clutch&mdash;a small group&mdash;of Aboriginal interests to negotiate with, excluding the interests of tens of thousands of other Aboriginal groups around this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We saw the same process of consultation in relation to the land fund, where they were trying to put together a package as part of the deal to get the native title legislation through. The minutes of the meeting that were used to discuss the land fund, which was part of the native title package, show the consultation processes that were undertaken as part of that. The minutes show that there were six or seven hand-picked A&hyphen;team negotiators, people that Mr Keating chose to deal with. To his credit, I do not think Mr Tickner would have agreed that that was a inclusive or consultative process. He said that he had the agreement of Aboriginal Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We found out, both at hearings of the Joint Committee on Native Title, now chaired by Senator Abetz, and also the two select committees on the land fund, that there were thousands of Aboriginal people across Australia who were appalled by the way that the Keating Labor government and its failed and since disgraced minister for Aboriginal affairs, Robert Tickner, handled consultations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Minchin and Senator Herron have gone about their jobs in a studious way. They have consulted broadly with all of those interests. We need to recognise&mdash;I think Senator Collins did recognise this&mdash;that it is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> very hard to create certainty in this area. It is almost impossible. When Mr Keating was Prime Minister he virtually ensured through his own bull at a gate type actions that that certainty could not be created. He legged over the National Farmers Federation and Rick Farley.

We have had a couple that stick in my mind in my relatively short time in this place. Firstly, there was your government's attempts in 1990 to simplify the corporations law. That was a 2,500 page exercise, as I recall. Indeed, it actually achieved a bit of simplification. It does not matter how many pages you have in a bit of legislation&mdash;it is the effect, the outcome and the processes you create.

First of all, Senator Brown, do you honestly believe that we on this side of the chamber never bothered to consult with the Aboriginal community until 2 March? We have been consulting with the Aboriginal community ever since the Liberal Party was formed. We were the ones who put through the 1967 amendment to the federal constitution.

If you had the benefit, as I have had, of the 11 days of hearings conducted right around Australia with the Aboriginal community, you would have been moved and impressed by the evidence. Sure, they were not necessarily the Aboriginal community that we read about in the newspapers every day and that we see ad nauseam on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS>, but let me say that they were very genuine Aboriginals who do not have the money from ATSIC and elsewhere to try to create a lot of publicity for themselves.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just want to make a few remarks in whatever time remains to this taking note of the answer in relation to native title. I do want to address my remarks to what Senator Bob Collins has said&mdash;and I am sorry that he has now left&mdash;because I do respect what Senator Bob Collins has to say on native title matters; I respect the experience he has on this. I do just want to say that I am sorry to hear that he thinks this is legislated paternalism, and I would be very glad to talk to him about his concerns with the particular provision we are referring to&mdash;that is, the power for the minister to intervene in relation to the right to negotiate process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment has been drafted to ensure that there is consideration of native titleholders' interests in the matter. So it was done very deliberately to ensure that the minister must take account of the interests of native titleholders when deciding whether or not to exercise the power proposed under that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> particular provision. I am therefore somewhat concerned by the remarks of Senator Collins, and I would like to talk to him about them. I would also remind him, of course, that the Labor Party in framing this bill did provide in section 42 for the minister to be able to override a determination made by the arbitrator, the tribunal, in order to allow a mining project to proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All we are doing is taking and applying exactly the same principle that is already in the act&mdash;that is, the capacity for the minister to insert his or her own determination in relation to the question of whether a mine can proceed by simply allowing the minister to bring such an intervention forward in the process&mdash;being the principle that the Labor Party provided in the act when it drew it up in 1993. I think the hysteria that has been built up over this suggestion is really quite ridiculous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to take the opportunity to stress that we have built these amendments very much on the principle of respecting the Racial Discrimination Act. We have gone out of our way to make sure that these amendments are not inconsistent with the Racial Discrimination Act. Nothing we have done in relation to our proposals on the right to negotiate would constitute any breach of the Racial Discrimination Act, nor is there anything in our amendments which breaches our fundamental commitment to respect the fact of native title where it has survived. In other words, we are not proposing, nor will we, any extinguishment of native title. Those are the two fundamental premises of our approach, and all these amendments respect those two commitments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also thank Senator Brown for his contribution, but I am also sorry that he thinks what we are doing is paternalistic. I would hope that is not the case. I would ask him to consider the fact that under this act, which has been in operation for three years, and in the four years since the Mabo decision, there has not been one determination that anybody, other than the Murray Islanders, has any native title. I think that is a very sad fact, and I think it is partly because of the incredible <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3795"> complexity and, frankly, unworkability of many parts of the Native Title Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much of what we are proposing I think will lead to a situation where it will be easier for Aboriginal groups to be able to get a determination in their favour that they have native title, and I hope that that will be the outcome. But at the moment, claims are getting bogged down in the most extraordinary and expensive legalistic processes that we want to simplify. It is not all a one-way street. There are many respects in which we have taken on board and accepted propositions put to us by Aboriginal groups, particularly in relation to the amendments dealing with the representative bodies. Those amendments take on board many of the things put to us by Aboriginal groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question of only allowing the registration of group claims is very much in response to Aboriginal positions put to us. It does not and will not prevent individual Aboriginals from making a claim to the Federal Court for a determination that they have native title. But in response to propositions put to us by Aboriginals, we are proposing that individual claims not be allowed to be registered for access to the right to negotiate&mdash;because, as Aboriginals keep reminding us, native title is really a communal title, a group title. Aboriginals are extremely concerned by the extent to which the act allows individual claims to be made with no group basis. So we have a situation of multiple overlapping and competing claims, particularly in the gold fields of Western Australia, that are seriously causing disharmony among Aboriginal communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we are working with Aboriginals to try to overcome some of those problems caused by the current structures in the act. Also the voluntary agreements process, as referred to by Senator Ellison, is something that Aboriginals are looking for. In fact, it is one area where there is great unity of purpose among industry, state governments and Aboriginals to find a way in which voluntary agreements can be entered into and registered so that acts can occur on native title land with the agreement of Aboriginals and so those acts can be valid and for the benefit of Aboriginals.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To take the second point first, in relation to consultation, Senator Abetz did clarify the matter somewhat, but I would like to put a sharper focus on it. I do not expect Senator Brown to have known about the work that a number of members of this chamber have done on both native title issues and land fund issues in the past six years. Many people in this chamber have spent day after day, week after week travelling to remote parts of Australia consulting with Aboriginal people both as a part of the formal processes of this Senate&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will; I am holding up the government's business, I know. I also inform Senator Brown that many of us have taken an active interest in Aboriginal affairs issues&mdash;in my own case, for 15 years prior to now. So, it is absurd to make that claim. I think that needs to be rebutted; I would not want the record to stand without that being corrected. Secondly, in relation to `certainty', Senator Brown, I think, has a mind&hyphen;set that, when anyone else talks about `certainty' or talks about `simplification' in relation to native title issues&mdash;particularly anyone from the coalition side of the chamber&mdash;they naturally refer to supporting the interests of business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3796">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Minchin has quite eloquently said, creating certainty, creating a process that is accessible to people may well create benefits for mining interests. But when I talk about `certainty', I can say to Senator Brown quite genuinely that I mean `certainty' for Aboriginal people as well. Senator Brown only needs to go to the gold fields of Western Australia&mdash;and I encourage him to do so&mdash;to look at the uncertainty that is in the minds of Aboriginal people, not only about the act but also about these overlapping multiple claims and access to legal support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the most serious uncertainty. It creates uncertainty in the minds of the Aboriginal communities and also anyone who is proposing any economic development which, in the long run, can assist some Aboriginal communities. That is an explanation of my use of the word `certainty'. I can see how it can be misconstrued by you and other people, and I would like to put on the record that explanation.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The continuing economic and social decline in country Australia, exacerbated by the 1996 budget cuts to funding for programs in rural and regional areas.</PARA>
<PARA>I have moved this motion today because I firmly believe that, unless the major parties and the rest of Australia wake up to the fact that rural Australia is in serious trouble, the bush will wither to such an extent that it will not recover. I firmly believe that the first budget of the Howard government, a National&hyphen;Liberal coalition, will hasten that decline, a sad indictment on the so&hyphen;called country party and a bitter irony for its supporters in the bush. Budget cuts affecting rural Australia have hit a wide range of programs, including assistance to agribusiness, regional development, drought relief, quarantine and inspection programs, education, the ABC and labour market programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indirectly, rural Australia will be affected by changes to health funding which will discourage doctors from practising in country areas. They will be affected by the proposed partial privatisation of Telstra which will devastate work forces in country towns and they will be affected by Public Service cuts affecting almost every service provided by the federal government. The exact budget cuts include the gutting of regional development programs; the cutting of $20 million dollars from the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service budget over the next two years; the freezing of programs of assistance for agribusiness administered by the Department of Primary Industries; and the savage cutting of $55 million from the ABC with the premier regional radio show <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Countrywide</EMPHASIS> dropped from next year's schedule. I note that this puts the lie to the government's claim that ABC cuts will not hurt rural Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps we can draw conclusions from this about the government's promise that privatising Telstra will not hurt rural people either. This government has failed to give farmers <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3797"> exemption from Austudy and Social Security assets test&mdash;despite the recommendations of several inquiries, some of which were chaired by National Party senators&mdash;and failed to give major cuts in allocations to drought assistance funding. We now have a primary industries minister who openly describes farmers as having a mendicant mentality&mdash;in other words, describing struggling farmers as beggars, dependent on handouts.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HX5">Senator WOODLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> . I have not got the date with me, but I will give it to you another time. The minister is a global free&hyphen;trader and is overseeing an administration that, in a few short months, has proposed that primary producers in this country will be exposed to massive risks by the proposed dropping of import bans on overseas salmon, chicken and apples.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that the average Australian and the media does not see the country as a very important, cutting edge or sexy issue, but the former science writer for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper Julian Cribb recently showed just how cutting edge the issue of keeping the family on the farm is for this country and the world. Mr Cribb, in a paper given in Canberra last August, pointed out that in the new world order a state of war exists between the haves and the have nots. From Rwanda to Rio de Janeiro, the conflicts are triggered by the underlying causes of poverty and deprivation of key human needs&mdash;land, food and water. Who fills those basic human needs? Farmers of course&mdash;mendicants as the primary industry minister calls them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If rural Australia is allowed to wither away by an economic rationalist government hell bent on survival of the fittest in an unfit world, those needs will no longer be filled by Australian farmers. We will have to feed our children imported food, no longer fresh and chemically treated. We could end up with the same nightmare scenario that exists today in the United States where every fruit and vegetable must be a certain size and colour to get passed by the food administration for sale and to arrive at that state every fruit and vegetable has to be chemically treated.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not overstating the drastic crisis in the Australian bush but don't take my word for it. Take the word of farmers and regional leaders from around Australia who were interviewed for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> magazine's August feature on how the government is subjecting the bush to death by 1,000 cuts in the budget&mdash;the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS>'s words.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this report, the National Party's branch president in Manilla, near Tamworth, said, `People are very angry&mdash;it's crunch time for the National Party.' In the same article, a former National Party MP Tony Windsor accused the coalition of betraying the bush by sidelining country issues with patronising attitudes. Or you could take the word of the heads of all the major churches in Queensland who are seeking urgent talks with state and federal governments over the crisis in the bush.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Or take the word of the director of Lifeline in south west Queensland whose funding to counsel drought stricken farmers has been cut by a federal minister who seems to think the drought is over. Or take the word of grain growers spokesman Ian MacFarlane, who recently raised questions about whether farmers were better off under the coalition or the Keating Labor government. I think we know what he was thinking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week a meeting of the rural community in Roma denounced the Howard government's record so far as the bush is concerned and accused National Party members of the government of not doing enough for people living in rural and regional Australia. This week a delegation of rural people to Canberra led by the president of the Queensland Farmers Federation will ask National Party back benchers to throw them a lifeline. I wonder if they will be heard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Farmers and rural people are practically begging the government for a hearing and this government is showing them a clean set of heels. The major parties and the people of Australia ignore the decline of the bush at the peril of every citizen in this nation. The choice is clear: we can choose to support our regional communities with something like the support given to the defence industry in this country so the family can stay on the farm or <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3798"> we can let Australia's rural heart wither and die, watch displaced country people move to the already crowded urban coastal areas, adding to the number of jobless people and in turn this will push up crime rates&mdash;typical of areas of high development such as the Sunshine Coast in my own state of Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I implore the government, senators and the people of Australia to wake up to what is happening in regional Australia or we are in deep trouble. I close with the words of Martin Flanagan, a writer for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> who writes regularly on rural affairs, in an article entitled `Economically rational mateship':</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Howard believes traditional Australian values are alive in the bush. They are in an agonised way.</PARA>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">But, for anyone who cared to look, the despair of people in the bush has been obvious for a decade or more, not least in the suicide rate among its young men.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rural and urban Australia have probably never been more distant than they are at this time. While post-war migration has transformed our major cities, its effect on rural Australia has been relatively minor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the same time, the National Party, through its partnership with the Liberal Party, has gradually moved away from policies for which it was formed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">If there was one thing the old Country Party never doubted, it was the need for government intervention. In John Howard's youth, politicians such as `Black Jack' McEwen protected his people behind a wall of subsidies and tariffs, and there was a good argument that he was right to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thirty years later, there is a feeling among people in the country that they have been politically betrayed, combined with the sense that their identity is under threat.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened carefully to Senator Woodley. I will not criticise Senator Woodley because I believe his heart is in the right place but he is about 60 years behind the times. Yes, McEwen did protect and subsidise farmers but it was a different era. It was an era of a buyer's market. You could sell any product that a farmer produced&mdash;anything. The world was starving. You cannot <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> lock yourself in a time warp. Those days have changed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know, Senator Woodley, that with your connection with the Uniting Church your heart is in the right place but, please, I urge you, don't try to make farmers dependent on social welfare because that is exactly what you are doing. They are proud people. They don't want to be locked into social welfare and they don't want to be mendicants. That is what you want them to be. You want them to be totally reliant on the church and government handouts&mdash;coming into the social welfare office and are beholden and dependent on your attitude.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the furthest thing that farmers want. They want to be independent. Yes, I know that there is hurt, agony and angst out there. People are leaving and being forced off their properties. No-one knows it more than I do. No-one gets mail like I do. I have been out there to see it. There is hurt there, and no-one can deny that. But let us put the blame where it lies. The blame lies firmly over there. When they let interest rates rise to 23 per cent, they sucked the equity out of every farmer's property. You did it. You are the ones to blame.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no way that you can control the price of wool and wheat; I accept that. You cannot control the drought; I accept that. But what you did do&mdash;and you were totally responsible for this&mdash;was let interest rates rise to 23 per cent. We have had droughts and low commodity prices before and farmers have always got by. They paddled like hell underneath like a duck on the water. They paddled like crazy, but they still got through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No-one could cop low commodity prices and interest rates of 23 per cent. Don't you cry crocodile tears over there for every person that has gone broke. You are guilty.

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The continuing economic and social decline in country Australia, exacerbated by the 1996 budget cuts to funding for programs in rural and regional areas.</PARA>
<PARA>Let us just have a look at what the budget did for rural Australia. The isolated children's allowance was increased by $17 million. Senator Woodley did not acknowledge that. Let us be honest. You are a man of the cloth, you should acknowledge those things. If you are going to criticise, at least be fair about it and acknowledge some of the benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Primary and secondary correspondence allowances have increased by $1,000 to $1,500 per annum. Even Senator Woodley acknowledges that the government got that right. The non-means tested basic boarding school allowance increased to 55 per cent of average boarding fees from $2,500 to nearly $3,000. That is another benefit for rural Australia. There is $123 million for RAS for 1996-97, an increase of $90 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us be reasonable, Senator Woodley. When you come into this chamber, you of all people&mdash;and I acknowledge your concern for farmers&mdash;should at least be honest and acknowledge where the government is giving and not just come in with a diatribe of absolute negativity. As I said, Senator Woodley, what you want, what you have got in your mind, what the Democrats want, is a government that will have the farmers totally relying on handouts. That is not what farmers want and that is not what they would even think about. That is totally in opposition to what a farmer wants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yes, there are needy farmers, as I have conceded, but there are wealthy farmers out there too. There are farmers who are doing it well. There are farmers providing millions and millions of dollars for overseas exports. There are hundreds and thousands of farmers, but there will always be some at the bottom end of the scale that do need help. We certainly acknowledge that and we are prepared to move in and help them.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3800">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why there is a $90 million increase in RAS funding. The drought relief payments are holding on at the moment. I urge the government, and I will continue to urge the government, to extend those drought relief payments after the December cut-off period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So today we have a motion that was borne out of a misconception of what the Democrats want to see for the Australian farmers. Unfortunately, Senator Woodley is totally wrong. The National Party have not walked away from the farming sector. The Liberal Party have not walked away from the farming sector. The people who are responsible for the absolute and utter disaster in the farming area are the people who extended the interest rates up to 23 per cent. If there is anything that devastated the farming industry, it was the 23&hyphen;plus per cent interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might add, Senator Woodley, that you voted with that party over there when it was the government. You voted with them on an average of about 70 per cent of the time. So you are just as culpable as the Labor Party in this matter. So please do not come in here crying crocodile tears and putting up stupid motions that have no substance. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

I have to make one brief reference to the contribution I just heard from Senator Boswell. One of the things that really amused me about the National Party reaction to the last budget was a doorstop that was done by the Leader of the National Party, Mr Fischer. It was a doorstop that I understand actually outraged many backbench Liberal members who are in regional seats.

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator BOB COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, I know a lot of the backbench regional members were not too impressed, but it was a fair indication of where the National Party is these days. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> They claimed as their chief victory, protecting against the attacks from the Liberal Party, a program which the Labor Party retained in office for its whole 13 years, and that is pretty much where the National Party is these days.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting&mdash;Senator Woodley would agree with me on this&mdash;how the rhetoric changes when you change sides in parliament. When I was the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, I heard nothing but `fortress Australia' from Senator Boswell. It has all changed. The barriers are down now that they are in government. We can open it all up. I am delighted to hear him say that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Woodley mentioned the Lifeline service in Queensland that is providing desperately needed help to primary industry people who, I regret to say, are still in real distress in that state. Help is probably the best value for money that you can get. This tends to be the case with most federal money delivered to the responsible charities because of the huge amount of voluntary and unpaid effort that is put in to supplement it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the real response to the budget, I do not think that that example can be improved upon. It is a simple story, but I think it encapsulates the new political attitude brought to the bush by this government. As a Labor Party member, I have to say that with some feeling of irony. It shows that a human element to national government was actually lost on 2 March.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I received an anxious phone call before the budget from the annual conference of the Queensland Graingrowers Association, which was held in Toowoomba. I was told that the Darling Downs and South West Regional Director of Lifeline, the Reverend Noel Parke, had made an impassioned plea to the 400 delegates at that conference for carry&hyphen;on funds to keep Lifeline's farm crisis counselling service afloat. Reverend Parke told the delegates that he had been informed by a senior officer of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy at the rural finance summit in Canberra `not to bother reapplying' for funding to maintain the farm crisis counselling service. It currently provides up to 500 <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3801"> drought affected farm families in Queensland with assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As primary industries minister, I had arranged for funding for $105,000 to go to Lifeline in each of the past two years, after personal representations I had received from Reverend Parke and the Queensland Graingrowers Association. I was shocked at the federal government's apparent disregard for the basic welfare needs of these farming families, and the Howard government provided no cogent reason for its reluctance to provide this ongoing support for family services in southern Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The workload of the service is immense. The last of the money provided by us runs out at Christmas time. The current government confirmed during a Senate estimates hearing last week that its decision is final. That is what they said at Senate estimates in response to this matter when I pursued it. There is no money in this budget for the Lifeline service for drought affected farmers.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a shame, Senator West. It is contemptible. I do not actually raise this today to score a political point. I do so, as I said at the outset, to demonstrate a fundamental difference between this government and the last government in terms of the human dimension of the help that is being provided. I guess I also take the opportunity of raising it once again in the debate in a last&hyphen;ditch attempt to ask the government to change its mind and to provide funding, that only last week it said it would not, to this service to provide this desperately needed help to drought affected farmers in Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of how valuable this help is&mdash;and I do not mind putting this on the record&mdash;the financial counsellors in adjoining services, the counsellors who actually work professionally, each voluntarily offered to give up a day's pay in order to have the money diverted to this service run by the Reverend Noel Parke and Lifeline. Of course, Reverend Parke declined that offer, but it was a genuine offer made by those financial counsellors to give up their own money in order to keep the service going.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a service which this government has currently said it will not support. I take the opportunity of this debate to ask the government again to reconsider that decision and to provide the very small amount of money that the service so desperately needs to help these drought ravaged families in Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A string of National Party politicians ran a very public campaign last year when it was rumoured in the financial press that the former Labor government was planning to drop the diesel fuel rebate. It was, of course, not true. As usual, those fears proved to be absolutely groundless. At the time, as I said before, the National Party politicians all proclaimed that this was absolutely essential to ensure that farmers survived in Australia, so they claimed it as their chief victory in retaining it in the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the absolute irony of it&mdash;it seemed to be lost on Tim Fischer&mdash;was that the only people who were making an attack on it were his Liberal colleagues in the coalition and particularly, of course, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In government we adopted a total systems approach to primary industry to build a viable and long&hyphen;term future for agriculture and to improve the economic and social fabric of rural areas. The integrated package of rural policy and programs in government was aimed at: improving farm profitability and international competitiveness, encouraging sustainable agricultural practices, and enhancing social and economic opportunities for rural communities. The focus was towards low levels of government support and a high degree of market responsiveness. Government assistance was primarily aimed at helping individuals and groups to identify their needs and to acquire the information, skills and resources necessary to apply practical solutions. This was done across all portfolios.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the primary industries and energy portfolio we strived to ensure that it included every single stakeholder, and I think we did that successfully. From state governments to local governments to regional and community councils, I think we did make a very successful effort in regionalising these programs. It <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3802"> was, in fact, a concerted effort to help whole catchment areas and whole regions rather than it being help simply directed at individual farmers or groups of farmers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In contrast, between the 1993 election and the March poll this year, the now Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, John Anderson, released one new opposition policy document for rural Australia. It was an internally inconsistent drought policy which would, if it were ever implemented as written&mdash;I hope it will not be&mdash;largely undo the national drought policy. Thankfully it has now been dropped.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the campaign Mr Anderson released one policy document, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Reviving the heartland</EMPHASIS>, which I read as though I was looking into a mirror. It picked up every major policy platform that had been developed by Labor in government: for example, the much vaunted supermarket in Asia strategy. That strategy could not have been formulated if the Labor Party had not, in a policy sense, stocked the shelves with our food into Asia program, which this program simply replaces with a new name. All the major policies are still in place, although now at greatly reduced funding levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> What are not in place&mdash;as Senator West knows, as I know and as the coalition members who have been protesting, some of them publicly, know&mdash;are the thousands of public servants who have lost and will lose their jobs in government departments throughout small towns in rural and remote Australia. There is the closure of Medicare offices, the majority of them in regional Australia; the closure of tax offices throughout country areas in Australia; the closure of CES offices in country towns; the wind back of ABC services, which inevitably will hit the bush hardest; the complete closure of the entire department of regional affairs here in Canberra; and, I might add, the subsequent closure of the Office of Northern Development in Darwin. In terms of my own electorate, that office was absolutely crucial in getting major development projects such as the MacArthur River Mine and the Mount Todd Mine off the ground. They have all closed down with the consequent loss of people and their families from regional Aus tralia. These are all the initiatives of this government in office in terms of the contribution they are making to regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During a number of years as transport minister and then primary industry minister, I was belted up by every National Party politician in Australia about the fact that, according to them, we did not fund roads sufficiently in Australia. To my utter astonishment&mdash;members of the National Party should hang their heads in shame over this&mdash;in this budget there is a massive $620 million cut to road funding for the national highway system in Australia. Most of it, of course, is in regional Australia, not in Sydney and Melbourne. I could not believe that particular budget provision, but there it is: a reduction of $620 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why do I mention that? We just heard Senator Boswell, with a straight face, talking about the sins and iniquities of the Labor Party, when in government, increasing fuel excise. Is he seriously suggesting by necessary inference that in government the coalition now proposes to reduce it? Of course not! But they have actually reduced the level of road funding under Labor by $620 million. Talk about a bunch of hypocrites! I have to say that this list goes on and on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a lot of pain and most of it is being felt in regional Australia. This government fails to appreciate that many of the lost jobs&mdash;whether they be in the public or private sector&mdash;were providing absolutely vital off&hyphen;farm income to many rural families across Australia. In fact, it had become, in some places, almost an institutionalised additional income which kept those farms viable and the families on those farms. This budget absolutely and unarguably widens the gap between rural and remote Australia and the cities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the most significant structural problems that Australia suffers from is that we are the most highly urbanised people on the face of the earth. There are 17 million of us in this huge island continent: 90 per cent of us live in half&hyphen;a&hyphen;dozen cities, most of them on the eastern seaboard. The federal government has got a major responsibility for doing everything it can to improve that situation and to reverse it, and yet we now have a brand&hyphen; <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3803">new coalition budget that, in fact, significantly widens that gap and worsens that problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To our utter astonishment&mdash;it is the first time I have ever seen this in print from a government in Canberra of any political persuasion&mdash;what did the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) say in justification for closing down the federal Department of Regional Development and closing down the funding for all the RDOs across Australia that were doing such significant work? Not all of them, of course, were successful, but have a look at what the mayors of the cities where some of them were operating said about the real on the ground support that they were giving to those townships&mdash;plenty of them were saying it. They were all closed down, but what was the federal minister's formal reason for doing so? To my utter astonishment he put out a press statement which said that the reason they closed down the Department of Regional Development was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no clear rationale or constitutional basis for Commonwealth involvement.</PARA>
<PARA>Where does that leave the National Party in the coalition, might I ask, rhetorically?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is on the public record. It is an astonishing statement. He then went on to say in the press release, just in case you were in any doubt, that the responsibility for regional development firmly rested with state and local government. The federal government officially&mdash;from the minister&mdash;washed its hands of regional development in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a rural Australian myself, I would be the first to acknowledge that rural Australia has done it tough in recent years. But I beg to differ from the words used by Senator Woodley in this urgency motion today. I beg to differ from his description of the decline in country Australia and prefer to term it rather, as Senator Boswell did, as the change in country Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes that we are talking about have been apparent for some years, with three key areas of concern: a declining population base; economic stagnation; and a sense that it is the poor relation to the major cities. These problems existed long before this government came to office and they are a reflection, if anything, on some of the policies and attitudes of the previous government to rural and regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well as the areas of concern that I have just mentioned, over the last 10 years we have had low or fluctuating commodity prices, between five and eight years of drought, and a drift of population to the cities. In some ways, this was attempted to be addressed by the regional development program that Senator Bob Collins has just referred to. He knows very well that two&hyphen;thirds of the funding for those programs was spent on the better cities program, that there were major problems in that program identified by the McKinsey, report such as that the program was poorly delivered, the highly bureaucratic reporting requirements and the excessive administrative burdens that were placed on RDOs under the programs. Not only that, the program was poorly conceived and RDOs had a limited success.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In contrast to this, Minister Sharp has announced that there will be brokering of major improved links between the regions and the investment and financing community, and given that the McKinsey report criticised the cargo cult mentality and the way in which the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3804"> regions themselves had difficulty accessing investment and financial advice, this should go a long way before that. Senator Collins also said that we are putting no more money into it. He knows very well that one of the budget items this year was an additional $10 million over the next two years to complete already existing programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I move on to the way in which this government has started to address the problems of rural and regional Australia. Apart from the $1 billion family tax initiative which will give families more choice about work and parenting, there is, as Senator Collins did not remark on, a new $149 million road safety black spot program to improve roads, 50 per cent of which will be spent on rural roads. The road toll for 1995 was 2,017 people and road trauma costs Australia $6 billion annually. Anything that can move against this will be an improvement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Collins also spoke expressively about the supermarket to Asia program and the way in which our initiatives were a development of the previous government. The major difference that he did not talk about was that our micro&hyphen;economic reforms in transport and industrial relations will act so that we can at least deliver more efficiently and cheaply food to Asia in a way that the previous government never did. There have been many horror stories of perishable cargoes left to rot on wharves while unions went on strike and the previous government could not bring its much vaunted industrial relations program to bear on that so that we were at least able to deliver our exports. Therefore, we gained an extremely bad reputation in Asia for not delivering on time and not delivering our contracts. One of the major initiatives of our whole economic program will be to work in concert with the supermarket to Asia program so that at least we can gain a record as an efficient exporter and one who delivers cargoes on time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Supermarket to Asia is going to look at the development of streamlined national food safety and residue regulations where there is considerable scope for reform and reducing the cost of regulation in the food industry&mdash; <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> something that the previous government was not prepared to consider.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Need I point out in this budget the additional $49 million to accelerate regional forest agreements. There has been a new woodchip export licensing system which will allow for an additional one million tonnes of woodchips to be sourced from sawmill residues. Need I contrast that with the forest agreements of the previous government which never even got off the ground!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have restored CSIRO funding. We have made a $90 million extension of drought assistance. There has been a four per cent increase in local government grants. There has been an integrated shopfront set up for services provided by the Department of Social Security and the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Kelty report put out by the previous government considered many of the regions in Victoria as far as their export potential and the way in which they could improve their employment and productivity are concerned. Two of those are the Barwon&hyphen;Camperdown region and the Goulburn Valley region, both of which are poised to take advantage of the food technology initiatives which will be set up by the supermarket to Asia program, and that is something that I, as a Victorian, would be particularly pleased to see.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the deficiencies identified by the Goulburn Valley area was the lack of undergraduate places at universities to enhance the tertiary skills of those young people living in that region. As Minister Vanstone has announced that with the university reforms there will be 6,000 new undergraduate places next year, I can only imagine that this will bring great joy to the Goulburn Valley.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lastly, like Senator Boswell, I would particularly like to point out the sheer hypocrisy of the Australian Democrats in bringing this matter of urgency to the Senate. For instance, not only do the Democrats advocate death duties, which would knock the inheritance of family farms right out of the economic spectrum; they have also declared themselves against the live sheep trade which underpins domestic sheep prices. They have always advocated ridiculous, to&hyphen;the&hyphen;extreme&hyphen; <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3805">left environmental ideas rather than looking for a combination of environment and sustainable farming activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most recent demonstration of this was, I regret to say, Senator Allison's maiden speech, during which she painted farmers as environmental vandals. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Farmers have pushed their land to the limit already in order to be competitive. Many have gone over that limit with disastrous consequences.</PARA>
<PARA>And she went on. For this Democrat senator to be representing herself as a senator for Victoria, where she must represent everyone, is totally reprehensible. I put to the Senate that this exposes the hypocrisy of the Democrats in putting such a motion before the Senate, and I ask the Senate not to carry this motion.</PARA></SPEECH>

I have local newspaper clippings six inches deep on my desk, all drawing attention to the failings of the current federal government to look after regional and rural Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The one I quote is an excerpt from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Liberal</EMPHASIS> of 3 October which reports on a Newspoll of last week revealing the anger at the cuts of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The federal government's strong lead in the opinion polls has slipped since the August budget, with dissatisfaction for Prime Minister John Howard rising sharply in rural areas . . . The largest jumps in disapproval for Mr Howard were among voters from rural areas (up 14 per cent) and from Queensland (up 13 per cent).</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1X4">Senator WEST</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You are right, Senator Hogg, it is a shameful thing, but at least people who live in rural areas are beginning to be aware of what is happening and what is being done to them by this government. The budget betrayed the bush. There is no other way to describe it. It was one of the most <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> damaging budgets to rural and remote areas in decades. The government's claim that it has improved the lot of those in the bush is nonsense. The impact of these cuts will be long term and far reaching.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government&mdash;the Howard-Fischer government&mdash;gave a hint of what it would do when it abolished the regional development program of the former Labor government before the budget. It did not reduce its funding as the report of the National Commission of Audit suggested. No, it went even further. It abolished the program altogether.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I asked during estimates why the transport and regional development title was still being retained after the government had abolished regional development, I was told that that was not correct. I suppose, technically, it is not. They only had a staff of 220; they now only have a staff of six, which reports to the transport economics area&mdash;not to any other operative area in the department. One has to wonder what this group of six people is going to be able to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Collins has very clearly outlined what the impact of the abolition of regional organisations is going to be. I know very well. I was in Dubbo the day the announcement of the abolition of the department took place. I know very well the palpable anger that was being felt by that community, because that community was benefiting from a $2 million grant under this program for which it had been able to leverage over $40 million from AGL for the construction of a natural gas pipeline from Marsden to Dubbo and beyond if the RDOs had continued to be funded to the proper extent. They were very uncertain on that day&mdash;at that early time in the morning&mdash;as to whether their contract was going to be honoured or not. Fortunately, they were one of the organisations who had the two signatures on the contracts, and the cheques have been paid. They also have received $200,000 to set up a white cypress mill in Gilgandra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The benefit to these communities is untold. The benefit of bringing natural gas to the Orana region of New South Wales means that industry will be attracted there&mdash;private industry will be attracted there&mdash;and that will, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3806"> therefore, set up further jobs and further development for the region. But what does this current government do? It has abolished it completely. This is the government that says it cares about business and cares about industry. You would not think so by its actions. Its actions speak far louder than its words.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the other things that it has done is make massive cuts to labour market programs&mdash;a cut of $1.5 billion over the next four years&mdash;and that is going impact extremely heavily on rural areas. It has introduced cuts to skillshare, cuts to the LEAP program and cuts to new work opportunities. These programs have not just been providing employment for people but they have been providing these people with training and with skills. If we are going to be a caring community and offer our community the best chance available to them as the economy improves and as jobs become more prevalent, then we have to have an educated and trained community. But not this government! It does not care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another cut that we saw in the budget that will be particularly harmful to rural areas was a $620 million cut to the national highway system. How long before they fix the rest of the bridges between Narrabri and Moree? How long before a bypass can be ready for Moree? How long before Coonabarabran can have a bypass? These are road safety issues. It was fine for Senator Troeth to talk about some money that went to black spots&mdash;what was it; $149 million? What about preventing major problems by maintaining expenditure to the national highway system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have cut $620 million out of that and replaced it with a piddling $149 million. It just does not add up. Moree, Dubbo, Narrabri, Coonabarabran, Gilgandra&mdash;all of those places on the Newell Highway, which is one of the national highways&mdash;will in fact be not able to continue with the plans they had under way for bypasses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is $30 million cut from National Rail; $200 million cut from Landcare; $170 million cut from child care; $570 million cut from aged services; $55 million cut each year for the next four years from the ABC; and $1.8 <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> billion cut from higher education. This is a government that cares about the bush? Don't give me such garbage! It is obvious that these cuts are going to impact on all of Australia, but particularly on rural areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cuts to the ABC will be extremely hurtful because the ABC fulfils a very important role in country areas. It is not just entertainment; it is information. It is stock market information and expert advice and information to rural primary producers. But that is of course going to be cut.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cuts to higher education are going to have a massive effect, as will the increase in the HECS fees for university students and the tiering of those fees. The other stupid thing they have done is put agriculture into the second tier of payments, which will mean that fewer farmers will choose to educate their children or themselves. The Labor government worked for years to improve agricultural education for farmers and to help them both economically, through more efficient practices, and environmentally, through teaching new farming techniques that limit the harm done to their land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The higher education cuts will affect all students, as well as the universities themselves. Fewer country people will have an opportunity to receive higher education, which not only assists them with their careers but also plays an important role in the social development of our young people and communities. There are a number of rural and regional universities out there. One of the government senators has a bright idea. Senator Tierney is quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Northern Daily Leader</EMPHASIS> of 5 October as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rural universities should look towards supplementing their revenue by courting the overseas student market&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The University of Central Queensland which has a campus in Sydney for full paying overseas students is a good example of this model working.</PARA>
<PARA>It just makes you wonder what world they are living in. It is important to note that there have been a number of programs that have been axed. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Liberal</EMPHASIS>  of 3 October states that Mr Ossie Cruse, the state Aboriginal Lands Council chairman, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3807"> believes cuts to government spending on Aborigines will have a `devastating effect' on communities throughout New South Wales. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Cruse said all Aboriginal organisations would feel the effects of ATSIC's budget cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">He said Aborigines were already turning to the NSWALC for both funding and guidance as job cuts were confirmed in Aboriginal communities.</PARA>
<PARA>This government's actions are going to impact upon the actions and the lifestyle of people outside. I will finish with an editorial from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Central Western Daily</EMPHASIS>  of Orange of 5  October entitled `Federal Nats still asleep'. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Feedback from primary industries indicates that the Orange farm sector is expecting a favourable result from its campaign against the importation of New Zealand apples.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You had the opportunity, Senator Woodley, to assist the then opposition in trying to curb the extravagances of the Labor Party when they were in government, but you failed to do that. Now you have the gall to blame us when we are trying to take a responsible decision. We have had to take a decision in a way that there are some cuts. Yes, they were difficult decisions and the coalition had to decide to try and spread the pain across a wide range of people. The National Farmers Federation, when they first responded to the budget, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not acceptable, after four years of solid economic growth, that Australia should be running an underlying deficit of over $10 billion.</PARA>
<PARA>So we have an underlying deficit of $10 billion. We are paying back $10 billion in interest. And they said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The benefits to Australian agriculture and to the regional community generally from tough Budget measures are already clearly apparent in the recent reductions in short and long term interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Passage of the Budget through the Senate will open the possibility of future interest rate reductions.</PARA>
<PARA>They then listed some of the things they welcomed in the budget, like retirement savings accounts, the diesel fuel rebate and core funding for Landcare. There were a number of issues that they outlined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The National Farmers Federation itself admitted that there had to be some tough decisions in order to achieve the long-term <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3808"> gains that we need to put Australia back on track. Senator Bob Collins came in here with his heart bleeding saying that the human element had been lost on 2 March and the difference between the last government and this government was the human debt, as has been mentioned. Bunkum!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are taking a responsible role to ensure that we have money to spend for future generations. We are not going to be as cavalier as the Labor Party in spending money that the next generations will have to pay back. Of course, there is some pain. Of course, there is some sharing of that pain across the community because we now have to make up for lost time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the opposition had the opportunity of quarter after quarter of growth, they threw it away. They threw it down the drain. When they had the opportunity, when they sold the Commonwealth Bank, when they sold Qantas, did we see a natural heritage bill? Did we see part of that money being spent to retire debt? No. Did we see that money being spent on something like a natural heritage bill? No, but the coalition has put up a proposition for the partial sale of Telstra, a one-third sale of Telstra. That is a commitment that all the money raised, bar $1 billion of it, will go to retiring debt and the other billion will go into a program that will benefit rural and regional Australia enormously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you had come around with us to those inquiries and listened to those farmers in rural areas in Albury, Senator Woodley, if you had listened to farmers who came and visited us from Tasmania, you would have heard them talking about the benefits of the natural heritage bill and the benefits to rural areas of creating jobs and of actually increasing their productivity. To come in here and say that we are not supporting the rural and regional areas, that we are contributing to the decline in programs in rural and regional areas, is only telling half the story. You are looking at only some of the things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Collins came in and said we were going to close tax offices. It is so easy for him to actually fail to remind people that it was the Labor Party that actually set in train the closing of those tax offices when it was <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in government, but he has come in here and blamed us for it. It is a bit rich for them to come in here and blame us for something they had already initiated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have also said there has been a massive cut in road funding. Let me talk about road funding. The road funding commitment of the previous Labor government has been supplemented enormously. The shadow minister for transport, the honourable member Melbourne (Mr Tanner), actually issued a press release in August saying that the Howard government had slashed road funding. He was absolutely wrong, and it is totally wrong for Senator Collins to come in here and say that we had slashed road funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth has allocated $1,603 million for road funding in 1996-97, which is up from $1,569 million in 1995-96. It has gone up. I do not know what Senator Collins has been reading, but they are not the same budget papers I have been reading. It is the largest road funding budget in the last 10 years excluding 1993, I think it was, when we had the blip of the One Nation program. So it is the largest one in 10 years. A large majority of that money will be spent in rural and regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you come in here and say that we have not committed ourselves, you have only to look at the rural program that Dr Wooldridge has put in place to try to increase the number of doctors in rural areas.

<STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(4.56 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am cognisant of the fact that Senator Ferris is waiting to make her first speech today, so I will keep my remaining remarks as brief as possible. In the course of the debate, before we ran out of time, I was saying that in the last five weeks I have visited and spoken to Aboriginal representatives in Darwin, Jabiru, Alice Springs, Uluru and Denmark in Western Australia&mdash;not by phone but in person.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was rather disappointed that in the debate some members opposite yelled out, `Ah, but you didn't get out of the bus.' It is really interesting that in a number of instances today the behaviour, inappropriate behaviour, of ministers was mentioned. That was relating to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3811"> a dorothy dix question which was intended to give the impression that I&mdash;and it was said to the media&mdash;had wasted taxpayers' money. It was quite interesting that this was the response in today's debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be extremely difficult to spend a day having meetings and briefings at Ranger Uranium Mine without being out of a bus. That has never been acknowledged by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, if we are talking about ministerial responsibility and behaviour, it is about time that that bad behaviour was addressed and it was acknowledged that I did not conduct a sit&hyphen;in, that I was out of the bus all day and that the only time during that trip to Ranger that I was still in the bus was when we were in the bottom of the pit and places like that. I think that I am entitled to make a decision to stay in the four&hyphen;wheel drive for the few minutes or not. The four&hyphen;wheel drive had to be decontaminated later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are talking about accountability. Accountability to whom? I am hearing from Aboriginal communities that spending on Aboriginal programs ought to be accountable to Aboriginal people. But we have not heard that from the minister. We have not heard from this minister that he understands that Aboriginal communities are saying that spending on Aboriginal programs should be accountable to Aboriginal people and communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Point No. 1 of the motion relates to the failure of the minister to seek advice or consult before illegally imposing an independent auditor on ATSIC. People were giving scores in that particular debate. I would have to say that the score on that ruling quite clearly was 3&hyphen;0 in relation to the illegality of that action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Point 2, seeking to make changes to eligibility criteria: yes, in the debate that was changed. We knew that. We went into that debate knowing that it needed to be changed. But I am talking about the responsibility of the minister to go into a debate on legislation on something that could well have cost ATSIC $4.7 million to repair a ministerial error. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many people in the Australian community cannot comprehend why this minister cannot understand the impact of his decisions. I was challenged during the debate to go with the minister when he visits a community. I have to say that I am covering all areas of the portfolio for Western Australia. But, if the minister is listening, I am happy to take the minister up on his challenge. Sure, you name the time. Provided that the Senate is not sitting and that I can make the time available without having other commitments, I am happy to accompany you on a visit to communities to listen to their responses to the changes that are occurring in the communities. Just let me know when that is to occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many reasons why it was necessary to have this debate today, not the least of which has been to show that some people do understand and have thought through the issues that are being promoted and have surfaced in the media in recent times. They do understand why the populist trend to find people to blame is a political godsend to the coalition; why it is helping them in their ratings. People do not understand what the bases are for the changes that have occurred that are making their lives less secure at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But this is not just occurring in Australia. If you look at a number of countries in recent times, with the change to economic rationalism the turmoils are often internal. So it is not just in Australia where scapegoatism has become a more obvious element of society. I would like to think that we can recognise the danger of scapegoatism before it reaches the levels to which we have seen it develop in other countries where, because of economic rationalist policies, because of such things as structural adjustment and major changes and differences between the rich and poor in those societies, there has been social turmoil and scapegoatism. I would like to think that, as mature people and as people representing the community in Australia, we recognise the dangers of scapegoatism and address them before they get to that stage in Australia; that, before they get worse, we will address them and start dealing with the issues of why people are feeling disenchanted, why there is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3812"> a growing number of working poor, why the nature of jobs and employment is changing, and why it is easy to look at other people who appear to be getting handouts and assume that they are on a good wicket, when it is not the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Bob Collins has very articulately pointed out the issues in relation to health, particularly health funding. I hope this debate about health and education service funding, but most particularly in the areas of self-determination, does get somewhere; that, if nothing else, the course of this debate today means that those issues will be recognised, that it will be seen that members of the community recognise it and are prepared to pull this into the debate that we are having today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today I was saddened to hear the minister pulling in the politically correct notion. That has been an excuse on a lot of occasions recently for parliamentarians not taking their responsibilities seriously and instead finding scapegoats in the community, targeting minority groups and those people who are less able to fight for their rights, less able to be represented in the parliament. It is our responsibility to try to represent not just the strongest in the community but all of the community where we can.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are statistics of Aboriginal deaths in custody which show that, despite what anybody says in relation to so-called benefits, a large number of Aboriginal people who have died in custody were directly involved with the stolen generation&mdash;and not just that generation, but also the next generation whose lives become dysfunctional because their parents' lives became dysfunctional. It did not just happen 60 years ago; its repercussions are being felt today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do commend this motion to the Senate. But, no matter what happens, I am extremely grateful that the debate has occurred and that these issues at least are being put in the public arena. I hope that some of these issues will be dealt with, and that people will realise that there are ministerial responsibilities which do mean that you often have to check. I hope, if nothing else, there is an immediate remembering that, if there are going to be <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> major changes, you check to find out whether they are even constitutionally possible and what their impact will be, before jumping in and making changes that will have major impacts on communities, especially communities which are already deeply disadvantaged in Australian society. I commend this motion to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;May I use this first opportunity I have had to speak in this place to add my congratulations upon your appointment. Fellow South Australians are proud of your achievement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an honour to take my place in the Senate, which our constitutional authors determined at the time of Federation should be a protector of the rights of our states and, in particular, the rights of the less populous states. In choosing to follow the style of the American Senate by providing equal representation for each state, Australia is regarded as having one of the most powerful upper houses in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As senators, we are part of an auspicious history. The original Senate was of course the highest deliberative body in ancient Rome, taking its name from the Latin senatus&mdash;literally, a group of elders. Clearly not all of us would qualify by their election criteria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had the chance to reflect on the history of the first Senate when I wandered among the spectacular ruins of the Forum and the Palatine Hill last year. These huge and imposing structures which still dominate the city are ongoing evidence of the civic pride, the  engineering brilliance and the majestic grandeur of the old imperial city&mdash;and among those ancient pieces of marble and granite, an ongoing reminder of the fragility of democracy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The state of South Australia, which I have the honour to represent, includes some of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australia's most diverse and beautiful landscapes, providing the backdrop for the resource industries which have become part of our nation's colourful history. The opportunities to create wealth for Australia and employment for its people were recognised soon after our state was first colonised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In June 1836, the first edition of the South Australian gazette and Colonial Register reported an early description by Captain Charles Sturt, who wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My eye never fell on a country of more promising aspect or more favourable position, than that which occupies the space between Lake Alexandrina and the ranges of the St Vincent gulf.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course the chances for prosperity offered to our early pioneers extended much further than the Adelaide plains. Our state's early wealth resulted from the determination and perseverance of our primary producers&mdash;those courageous and visionary men and women who pioneered our pastoral lands, establishing the great sheep stations which contribute to our wealth and our export income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Their lives and their lifestyle in the harsh and often unforgiving bush attracted comment from a range of visiting international writers, among them Anthony Trollope, who observed in 1873:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The number of sheep at these stations will generally indicate with fair accuracy the mode of life at the head station: a hundred thousand sheep and upwards require a professional man&hyphen;cook and butler to look after them; forty thousand sheep cannot be shorn without a piano; twenty thousand is the lowest number that renders napkins at dinner imperative.</PARA>
<PARA>Maintaining standards and more than a modicum of commonsense in the face of testing adversity is a proud tradition in country families. It still remains strong and long may it continue. Their personal contribution and those of their industries built the strong foundations of this great country. We in the cities continue to enjoy the benefits that flow from their bountiful harvests and offer them support when the elements do not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These great industries have given South Australia a good share of heroes, courageous Australians whose personal contribution continues to be remembered. Sidney Kidman, from a humble stockman's family, out of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3814"> school and working at the age of 13, sacked when he asked for a pay rise, through ingenuity and sheer hard work became the largest land&hyphen;holder in the British Empire. In 1921, Kidman was knighted, not for his contribution to the pastoral industry but for his wartime efforts in supplying horses and equipment, fighter planes, ambulances and shipments of beef and wool for the First World War. Thomas Elder, and his brother&hyphen;in&hyphen;law Robert Barr Smith, who together built one of the largest pastoral agencies in the world, provided hundreds of jobs and rural services to the farming industries around Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Pastoralists were of course not the only farming pioneers. Miners and early explorers found our first significant mineral wealth as South Australia was facing financial ruin. The early discovery of large copper deposits at Kapunda in 1842 and at Burra three years later saved the young colony from certain bankruptcy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These industries also fostered some very special South Australians. Essington Lewis, from humble beginnings in the mining town of Burra, rose to lead Australia's largest company&mdash;Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd. Douglas Mawson, a renowned geologist and engineer, is appropriately remembered for his pioneering spirit and incredible courage in adversity on the Antarctic coastline.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minerals and resource processing industries have continued to contribute to the wealth of South Australia. We have in our state Australia's largest onshore oil and gas reserves in the Cooper Basin. We produce 60 per cent of the world's precious opal. There is in our starkly beautiful outback a world&hyphen;class 200-year-old resource of copper, silver, gold and uranium at Olympic Dam, while the world's largest zinc smelter is at Port Pirie.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For almost a century, iron ore has been mined in the Middleback ranges to be processed at Whyalla and, of course, we have our significant coal reserves at Leigh Creek. The $20 million South Australian exploration initiative is now uncovering many more of the prosperous geological secrets that have remained hidden beneath our ancient soils. Greater resource wealth seems assured.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our primary producers, blessed with a bumper season last year and optimistic that another could be at hand, boosted exports of their products last year to almost three&hyphen;quarters of a billion dollars&mdash;an increase of more than 200 per cent. The state's winemakers recently toasted overseas sales of $315 million&mdash;up by a quarter on last year and more than 400 per cent higher than five years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Spectacular growth has also occurred in our manufactured exports. Our two motor car manufacturers are now producing 150,000 vehicles a year and they are selling their products to the world, creating new opportunities for expansion and jobs for more than 13,000 South Australians. During the past year, the vehicle and components industry exported products worth $254 million&mdash;double the figures of five years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year South Australia's exporting industry sold to the world products worth more than $4.5 billion&mdash;clear evidence that we have at last conquered our old rustbelt image. But South Australia is not just a state of billion-dollar businesses. Our smaller but equally important niche market industries are supplying the gourmet picnic baskets of the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have first-class speciality food&mdash;fruit from the Riverland; tuna, oysters, lobsters and marron from our growing aquaculture industries of Port Lincoln, the Eyre Peninsula, Kangaroo Island, the southern coastline and Gulf St Vincent; our lean beef and lamb from the lush pastures of the south-east; and rich grain products from the state's farming lands, which are widely sought after around the country. And, at last, the great restaurants of the world are discovering our fine wines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very proud of my state of South Australia, although my pathway to this place has also taken me through other states and territories. I first came to the national capital as a young journalist to work at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> and soon became an enthusiastic spectator of the national political scene. Canberra was then a robust and developing city, growing by more than 10 per cent a year. As the new suburbs tumbled over the grazing lands and the foothills of Woden and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3815"> Belconnen, the dust storms from the newly created cul&hyphen;de&hyphen;sacs and playing fields filled the houses&mdash;and the eyes&mdash;of the residents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What a spectacularly beautiful city Canberra has become&mdash;its avenues of stately trees and sweeping vistas a living tribute to the imagination of Walter Burley Griffin and his talented wife Marion whose significant contribution to her husband's work must surely soon be recognised in this national capital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During my days as a Canberra journalist I was privileged to meet Australia's first female federal member of parliament and later cabinet minister, Dame Enid Lyons, who was in Canberra to officially open a school in a suburb which bears her family's name. She was a modest, yet quietly inspiring woman, her forthright and commonsense approach to politics a lesson for us all. Dame Enid, writing in her first book, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">So we take comfort</EMPHASIS>, likened her entry as the first Liberal woman into federal politics as being, `like a lamb to the slaughter, like a sheep before the shearers, I was led forth to have a go.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many other women followed, including South Australia's Dame Nancy Buttfield, who became the fifth woman to enter the Senate, serving our state with distinguished representation for a total of 16 years. Today there are five women among South Australia's 12 senators and there are 23 women in the Senate&mdash;the highest number ever. Together with the 22 female members of the House of Representatives, women are now, on merit, clearly taking their place as elected representatives of their communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The state I represent of course led the way when, as Helen Jones has written, `On a hot December morning in 1894, a week before Christmas, the South Australian House of Assembly resounded to loud cheering as the parliament acknowledged its decision to give votes for women.' The youngest Australian colony was the first not only to give women the vote but also to allow them to stand for parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> I particularly mention the efforts of Catherine Helen Spence, a courageous campaigner and social reformer&mdash;and a journalist by profession&mdash;who stood, unsuccessfully, for selection as a representative of South Austral ia at the Federal Convention of 1897. Her personal commitment to the care of women and children, and their education and personal development has been well recognised by grateful generations who have followed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">South Australian women have continued in more recent times to make this special mark at a national level. Dame Roma Mitchell, who recently retired as South Australia's first female state governor, has been an inspiration to generations of women as she, with brilliance yet quiet modesty, blazed a trail across the legal pathways of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My own entry to national politics followed valuable experience as a member of staff both in federal parliament and with the South Australian state Liberal government. I worked for several years as a lobbyist here in Canberra as a member of a quite special team of people at the National Farmers Federation. A unique combination of commonsense and courage, together with great leadership, delivered some very important national milestones.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No-one in Canberra on that crisp winter's day will ever forget the 45,000 farmers and their families who gathered on 1 July 1985 outside Old Parliament House to make their own peaceful and well&hyphen;mannered protest about the effect of interest rates and spiralling farm costs. There were no bills for damage on that day, no riot shields were required, no shops were looted and certainly no injuries were inflicted on our police. That special day, when the farmers came to town, must surely be Canberra's most successful political rally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a resident of Canberra during the early eighties, I watched with some awe the construction of this great white House on the Hill. With my two sons, I came to the top of Capital Hill the day before the road closed to begin the construction of the new building. Two rabbits and a large red kangaroo, early inhabitants of the hill, scuttled across our pathway through the grass and scrub on that day&mdash;a reminder that this was once considered the Bush Capital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During those early years of construction, when the building was taking shape and we were offered periodical chances to visit, I often picked my way carefully through the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3816"> cavernous spaces lit only with occasional hanging light globes. On one occasion, I sat on some of the concrete shapes that have now become this great chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">South Australia's magnificent Imperial Black granite from the Black Hill quarries, north east of Adelaide, is well represented in this national parliament. It is in the forecourt, it paves the public foyer, and a single piece now forms the reflective pool in the Members' Hall. But most importantly, it is South Australia's Imperial Black granite which paves the area beneath the massive flagpole from which flies our great Australian flag.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The construction of this new parliament building offered me a special time for reflection and an opportunity to consider what kind of Australia those men and women elected to this place would frame for my children's grandchildren, to wonder what effect their decisions would have on future generations each time they passed&mdash;or failed to pass&mdash;the myriad of legislation crucial to our nation's future, and to consider whether, as teenagers in another half a century, my great grandchildren will face the future with optimism or despair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My own musty teenage diaries reveal&mdash;amongst the tittle and tattle of daily school life and study, the trials of learning to drive and the warnings over curfews disobeyed&mdash;an overwhelming optimism which leaps from almost every scribbled page. There is a clear sense of hope and the sure knowledge that not only was there a choice of careers but that work would certainly follow&mdash;and the chance to walk home in safety from the Friday night dance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our task here&mdash;not only as elected men and women but also mostly as mothers and fathers, and some as grandparents&mdash;is to take on the task of restoring this sense of hope and optimism to all of our young people. We have the awesome responsibility, for example, of turning around the ever-increasing rates of youth suicide, which results in more than 400 of our youngsters taking their own lives before their 25th birthday, leaving families and friends who never fully recover.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this bountiful country of ours, how can it be that on every day of every year one of our young men or young women is making that fateful decision? It is the responsibility of each one of us to uncover the reasons for this national tragedy. We simply must work together to make the policy changes that will restore hope to these young people and give them back the sense of optimism and purpose that they so desperately seek.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I consider myself very fortunate to have come to this Senate at a time when hundreds of thousands of Australians have decided to make a fundamental change in the way our nation is governed. They voted overwhelmingly for a new approach to our national government, to turn Australia around. They chose a Prime Minister and a government that would deliver this fresh policy approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They want us to unravel the myriad of regulations that were part of an old&hyphen;fashioned and paternalistic society. Freedom of choice&mdash;so that men and women themselves, not government, make the decisions that affect their daily lives&mdash;is what binds a thriving society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam President, I look forward to speaking in debates and voting for those policies that will bring a fresh approach to our great country, to restore the sense of hope that people are so desperately seeking. I thank the Liberal Party and all my South Australian supporters for giving me this opportunity.</PARA>

<PARA>There is a very strong and firm starting point for this debate, and I would like to start with a quotation from an eminent legal person. It goes along the lines:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where a person has a legal right to enforce or a legal defence to offer to another's claim, the imposition of substantial fees restricting access to the courts of law may place that person, unless he be affluent, outside the law's protection. In a society governed by the law no barrier can be erected against reasonable access to the courts for the vindication and protection of legal rights. To ensure that litigation is not frivolously commenced, <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">modest fees </EMPHASIS> have traditionally been exacted but the court has reserved a dispensing discretion to ensure that, where litigation can be seen to be justifiable, poverty is no bar to the operation of the law.</PARA>
<PARA>These are not just the words of any person or any jurist; they are, in fact, the words of the man at the pinnacle of the legal profession in this country: Chief Justice of the High Court, the Hon. Sir Gerard Brennan. They were included in the 1989 judgment in the matter of Citizen Limbo. It set out the principles on which court and tribunal fees should be based.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These were the principles that motivated the previous government when we developed the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 1994 <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Access to justice </EMPHASIS>and the Justice Statement in response to that report. In fact, in a sense they could be claimed to be the sentiments that motivated the current government's policy in this area before the election. Before the election they promised:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We make a commitment to keep a continual focus on the problems at hand&mdash;the achievement of a justice system that is accessible to all Australians, regardless of their means.</PARA>
<PARA>The measure that we have before us today is not just any disallowance measure. It is a measure which, as Chief Justice Brennan reflected in his judgment, goes fundamentally to the matter of Citizen Limbo. It goes very much to the core of our democratic system, it goes to the question of access to the courts, it goes to the question of access to rights and, consequently, it goes to the question of the relevance of laws made by this parliament to the citizens of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are debating, in fact, a disallowance motion which, if it is not carried, will see the continued implementation of massive increases in court fees&mdash;fees that will deprive not just tens of thousands but probably many more Australians access to a justice system. It will not be the very poor that will be denied access to justice by this measure; they are protected by the fee waiver provisions and the exemption provisions already in place. Nor will the rich suffer. For them fees represent no barrier at all. Those who will be denied justice as a result of these fees will be the ordinary middle Australians&mdash;the very people the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Access to justice</EMPHASIS> report targeted as being unable to access our justice system. They are the people, in fact, that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Access to justice</EMPHASIS> statement tried to assist through the justice system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not have here just a breach of promise by the government in terms of court fees and charges proposed to be levied by these regulations, but one that goes to the rights of citizens in this society. In moving in this direction I must say that not only has the government breached a promise and betrayed the access to justice system, they have also put themselves at direct war footing with the courts of this country. If one looks at a recent speech to the Australian Institute of Judicial <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3818"> Administration by the Chief Justice of Australia, one finds the following words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The settlement of disputes by legal process is a fundamental function of government in a society under the rule of law. If the function is not performed, the law is not applied and the festering sore of injustice spreads the infection of self&hyphen;help. Power is then unrestrained by law. Peace and order are at risk and, sometimes, tragedy may be the consequence. Laws that are put on the statute book mock the integrity of the political process unless the beneficiaries of those laws can enforce them.</PARA>
<PARA>There cannot be a clearer statement from the highest ranking judge in this country in terms of the importance of access to the judicial system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These measures proposed by the government in their budget of betrayal deny so many Australians access to the judicial system. We are talking about raising some $72 million from the Family Court system with these measures&mdash;a system which is there to assist families in times of crisis. What does this government want to do? It wants to rip $72 million off litigants in that system over four years. It also wants to take some $32 million from other litigants in the Federal Court system. For instance, your average small business claim will rise from just over $1,100 to over $12,000. The cost of enforcing a medium sized debt through bankruptcy proceedings will rise from $730 or so to at least $1,600 for an individual and over $3,000 for a company. A typical disputed family law claim will rise from $368 to over $2,000. An unlawful dismissal claim, which currently can be lodged free, will cost the applicants more than $2,700&mdash;and that is before one has to consider paying one's lawyers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the fees you pay to the government to actually get into court&mdash;to have one morning in court. That is before you pay for your lawyers. Individually, these fees are harsh and a real denial of justice to workers, family people and small business owners. Not only are they harsh in their instant application but also in respect of some of them there is a continuing application. Who can afford to pay some $650 up front every time they try to get legal access to their children for the weekend? Who can afford to pay more in court fees than many low income earners earn <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in a month in order to sue their boss for unlawful dismissal? Which veterans or pensioners can afford to pay $4,000 just to prove that they are entitled to compensation or a pension?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We cannot look at these fees in isolation, because they are part of a broader attack by this government in this budget on access to justice. For all the pain in respect of these fees, you might have hoped, you might have thought, there would be some compensatory gain. But you do not find any additional resources put into our justice system to make it fairer and more equitable. These fees are a part of the single largest attack on access to justice that we have ever seen in this country. The measures in the budget attacking access to justice, altogether, will recoup for the government $320 million over four years from access to justice programs. That is twice the amount that the previous government's Justice Statement measures were calculated to cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of the significant reforms in that statement, many of the policy initiatives and many of the programs will be thrown away by this broad attack on access to justice in our system. Without thought, without care and without evaluation, it was chop, chop, chop all the way through, serial cutting, with no consideration&mdash;as we found out time and time again in the estimates process&mdash;of those important considerations of access to justice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those who feared Fightback, it is worth knowing that Fightback would have cut back only $100 million from access to justice programs over the same period. We are talking about over $300 million. If the National Commission of Audit's programs are implemented&mdash;and they are being assessed by the government now&mdash;then we are looking at a further $200 million of funding waiting on the chopping block for the Attorney and the government to wield an axe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have here, I think, an ideological attack on access to justice. Why is not access to justice a core commitment of the government? Why were these cuts made when, in doing so, the government indicated very strongly that access to the law and access to justice were not a core commitment? In respect of all of these, I think, in a sense, we can say that we <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3819"> are helpless in the Senate. We cannot make the government continue the funding in terms of mediation services, and so many other programs, and in terms of the community programs that were part of access to justice. We cannot force them to maintain the levels of legal aid which are critical for Australians in terms of their capacity to access the courts. We cannot stop so many of the cuts that will cause increasing delays in the Family Court and Federal Court systems. We cannot stop the betrayal of kids, for instance, in terms of the reduction of services from the Family Court, and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one area where we can act and this is the one that is before us this evening, that is, we can tackle this particular issue. We can tackle it in a number of ways. We can tackle the government on their arguments. In terms of the estimates process, it became apparently clear that the government was committed to these increased recovery rates because it said that user pays, to a certain extent, should apply and we should try to link our cost recovery to the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The one principle that should not apply in the justice system is user pays. The words `user pays' came quite often from the officers who are trying to defend the government's moves here. But once again, it is the Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia who has demonstrated why user pays is plain wrong in respect of this particular issue. In his speech to the Australian Institute of Judicial Administration, his Honour said of `user pays':</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With respect, that profoundly mistakes the constitutional function of the judicial power of the State which, as I have said, is to apply the rule of law in resolving disputes and thereby preserving the peace, order and good government of society.</PARA>
<PARA>Justice should not be for sale. What the government is doing here is making it accessible to the highest bidder. Justice should not become a commodity for sale to the highest bidder. It is a public good and to that extent the principle of user pays should not be appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the other argument&mdash;that we have to link the fees here to schedules raised by the state courts&mdash;in a letter from the Law <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Council of Australia on 16 September, Michael Phelps set out the respective fees and charges in the state court systems. It is interesting to note that it only costs between $140 and $520 to commence an application in the state or territory supreme courts. It will cost $800 under this particular proposal to do so in the Federal Court for an individual and $1,600 for a company. Across the spectrum, when you look at the comparison of Federal Court and supreme court fees throughout Australia provided by the Law Council of Australia, you will find that this government's commitment to matching 30 per cent&mdash;which was the benchmark used&mdash;of state and territory fees is just plain wrong. It is a plain deception.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you look at what it costs to commence an application in the Federal Court under these fees and charges raised by the federal government compared with existing fees and charges, you can see that their argument is a dishonest one. Of course, that is only in areas where you can make a comparison. You cannot make a comparison in respect of the High Court, the Family Court or the Native Title Tribunal. The states and territories do not have those sorts of jurisdictions. There are many inconsistencies and many injustices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another injustice is the injustice embodied in the principle here where individuals might be charged so much but companies will be charged double. There is no distinction drawn by the government between the mega&hyphen;corporations&mdash;like BHP&mdash;which are used to using litigation as a means to drive small players out of the markets, and so on, as opposed to the $2 family company owning the corner shop, the video store, the petrol station, or whatever. They all have to pay the same. Whether they are big, mega&hyphen;, international or national organisations, or the local family company, they will have to pay twice as much as an individual.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there is a question about tax deductibility of legal fees, then fix the problem at the taxation system source and do not charge every corporation the same exorbitant fee. As far as we are concerned, we do not agree with the government's proposal because we see it <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3820"> as a grab for cash. When you look at the rhetoric of the government in terms of their justification, you find that rhetoric does not stand up. They have admitted, for instance, in the estimates process through their answers that, in raising all these fees and in levying all these fees, they did not once consider the impact that these fees might have on access to justice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have said for some time now that we have been prepared to be reasonable in terms of trying to accommodate a CPI based increase in the fees and to have this discussed by the parliament. But I must say that my patience has worn out. We have waited at least for two weeks from the last time that we deferred these disallowance resolutions. It was flagged two weeks ago that there would be negotiations between the parties to see whether we could come up with an alternative set of fees, a set of fees that may be acceptable to the Senate, or at least to some aspects of the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, that was some two weeks ago. Nothing has been provided to us since. There was one contact last week where we were asked about our view. Even last night I expected that there might be some further communication from the Attorney&hyphen;General's office. In fact, we rang them this morning asking for more details for us to consider and nothing substantive has been put to us in terms of the government's negotiating capacity on this particular issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There might, in fact, be an afterthought; Senator Vanstone might in fact have some thoughts. We are now in a position where the Senate is to make a decision with no substantive concrete proposals before it as to what the government intends to do. We cannot take you on trust. We have had two weeks to get some indication from you. Having had that indication from Senator Vanstone last time, we moved very quickly into the estimates process that afternoon. I asked the officers what was on the table in terms of renegotiated fees and whether anything was being seriously looked at by the government and none of them knew anything about it. None of them knew that the scales were being reviewed. In fact, they assured us a number of times that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> no work was being done within the department to look at these sets of court fees to see how they could be modified to reduce their impact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had no negotiations. We have had no information. I think it is a very poor situation that we find ourselves in now. After two weeks, when there had been quite an amount of time available, we are in a situation where the government still seeks to take over $70 million from poor families who have gone through a family court process&mdash;I must say that they are not so poor but, of course, they are poor afterwards&mdash;and over $30 million from others who might appear before the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It causes a problem because if there is an attempt to amend these regulations, it is now impossible to do so. Procedurally, under section 48B of the Acts Interpretation Act, the government cannot make these regulations while they are subject to the current motion or any other motion for disallowance. I think we are in a position where we cannot really amend on the run. I think we have to make a decision on the basis of what has been before us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the opposition, we are not prepared to have, at this particular stage, promises of vague amendments further down the track. One particular problem with that, of course, is that for every day that these regulations are not disallowed, many Australians are currently paying court fees at a level which they may not be paying in the end, and they should not be paying. In fact, many litigants are paying court fees for matters where, just a few weeks ago, they were not paying fees at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Typical divorces are still over $2,000&mdash;four times more than the $368 previously charged. Even if there is a cut, we have to compare that to the $368 previously charged. It is not good enough to come in at the last moment and suggest that maybe you might look at this down the track. In terms of the Federal Court, we are currently talking about a typical small business claim incurring some $12,500 in Federal Court fees. That is 10 times more than the amount currently charged. If you are going to come in with a last minute offer, Senator Vanstone, it is going to have to be <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3821"> somewhere close to that $1,000 rather than to the $12,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are 20 different fee increases imposed in the Federal Court by these regulations. We would not entertain any reduction unless it went to the whole spectrum, unless it went to the AAT, the national Native Title Tribunal and the High Court. In essence, we are talking about a very drastic increase in fees and charges here and an increase which is going to rip the money out of those who probably cannot afford it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have argued in the estimates process that there is an exemption clause but, looking at that exemption clause, it was pretty clear from reading the legislation that, unless you are a legal aid recipient, a pensioner or concession card holder or a person who is described in the legislation as a person who, because of their financial circumstances would suffer hardship if the fees were imposed&mdash;and hardship has been interpreted, on my understanding, as meaning someone who is very close to being a legal aid recipient or a pensioner or concession card holder&mdash;then a general comment from the minister saying, `Well, we are going to broaden this' is really not good enough. It is the guidelines that need fixing, and they need fixing to ensure that the hardship provision means more than being closely linked to legal aid recipients and pensioners and concession card holders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, the hardship test, as it currently operates, basically ameliorates what could otherwise be a very strict test and it does not provide a suitable avenue for access to justice for the vast majority of low, lower and middle income earners. That is the broad spectrum but I would also like to finish on a particular area, and that is the area of the workplace industrial relations cases, and particularly unfair dismissal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have received recently a letter from the New South Wales Young Lawyers, dated 4 October. They have asked me and the opposition to support their submission to the Attorney-General to revoke these fees. It is interesting to go to some of the issues they raise. They raise, for instance, the question of industrial law matters. They say:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new fees will require an individual applicant to pay $800 to lodge the application, $1,000 to set a matter down for hearing and $550 per hearing day. A company or trade union would have to pay fees of double those amounts. There will be additional fees for issuing subpoenas, obtaining transcripts, lodging notices of motion and other standard procedures. The absolute minimum fee for an individual applicant would be $2350 and for a company or a union $5700. Many matters would incur fees 50% to 100% higher than those amounts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Applications for matters of law to be referred or appealed to the Court from the Commission can be made by employer representatives or unions. Under the proposed new fees they would now have to pay an application fee of $1600, a setting down fee of $2000 and a daily hearing fee of $1100. This is a significant departure from the tradition of industrial matters being conducted for minimal cost. Since there is effectively no power to award costs the applicant will have to bear those costs even if successful.</PARA>
<PARA>So you have here a significant departure from established practice in industrial law&mdash;not just an increase but a significant departure. In respect of unfair dismissals, they say that that is a matter of particular concern to them. As they say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the Court fees will be waived for those eligible for Legal Aid and on other limited grounds, very few persons who had only just lost full time employment would qualify on those grounds. They would have to make a difficult decision to pay an $800 application fee, and face the prospect of paying a $1000 setting down fee and $550 per day in hearing fees at a time when they do not know whether they will obtain employment again in the foreseeable future. This would discourage many deserving claimants from making a claim.</PARA>
<PARA>They go on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The claimants would also be advised that they would be very unlikely to get back those costs even if successful, under the essentially `no cost' jurisdiction. Further, given the limits on compensation payable and the usual compensation awards in the jurisdiction, they would be advised that the likely result may not warrant the cost involved in bringing proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA>What is really interesting is their reference to the AIRC annual report for 1994-95. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . more than half of all awards for compensation payments for unfair dismissals were $6000 or less. I understand the soon to be released Annual Report for the 1995/96 year will show an almost identical result. The 1995/96 report will also show that 24% <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3822"> of compensation awards were for less than $3000. That report will also state that in about a third of unfair dismissal cases the hearing took more than one day.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Based on those statistics, an applicant, who would have to pay a minimum of $2350 for a one day hearing and a minimum of $2900 for a two day hearing, would get an average order of compensation of $6000, and 24% would get less than $3000. These figures show that once the fees are introduced many claimants would find they were financially not much better off&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>That is in terms of running cases. In fact, they would be worse off. They would be deterred from running the sorts of cases that are so critical in terms of unfair dismissal. The letter goes on. It is a rather useful letter because it does make the point that these sorts of fees would also hinder early resolution of claims. One does not need too much of an imagination to realise that employers would recognise that litigants would find it difficult to pay the fees and serious offers to settle would be rare in coming forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a host of our industrial relations matters, but what we are talking about here is a new precedent in industrial law. It is particularly important for instance in unfair dismissal, where a claim that a dismissal was harsh, unjust or unreasonable would go to the AIRC for determination. But if the claim is on other grounds, such as on the ground of race, sex or religion, it would be heard initially in the Federal Court where an applicant would have to pay, from the start, additional fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have here before us today is consideration by this parliament of the one critical issue in terms of access to justice that we can have a say in. As I said earlier, there is a broad attack here. In relation to community legal centres and the justice statement, it has been dismembered&mdash;item by item, part by part&mdash;taking $320 million out of the process and replacing it with just a small handful of dollars in terms of one aspect of family support, though at the same time cutting apart many other programs in the family support area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we in the Senate are concerned about access to justice, if we are concerned about Australians feeling as though they have rights <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that they can pursue in our democracy, if we are concerned about the government not using this mechanism as a way to rip the guts out of access to our court system, then I think we have no choice but to disallow these regulations to increase court fees and charges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to have been in a position where I could have said, `Well, we have had some fruitful negotiations.' But, as I say, we made our starting position clear to the government, which was CPI based. We raised our concerns through the AAT in terms of Family Court, in terms of another industrial court and some other critical areas. Though there have been suggestions that maybe the government is looking at negotiating, the officials did not know that at the start. We have seen nothing today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With a commitment to ensuring that people are not denied access, with a commitment to ensuring that the weakest in our society do not get hit by a levy of over $70 million on those who have to resort to using the family law system, we urge the Senate to maintain a very basic principle, a principle that means that access to justice is a right and not a privilege, that access to justice is not just another non-core commitment. It is very much a fundamental right of access in our democratic society. As I say, for these reasons we on the opposition side are very keen to ensure these regulations are disallowed.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In commencing, can I say that, if the Labor Party in its 13 years in government had never come into this place and sought to put up fees for courts and tribunals, what Senator Bolkus had to say might ring as being something he genuinely believed and had always practised himself. Since that is not the case, what he said today stands in stark contrast to Labor's record. I leave that to others to judge in that respect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Bolkus has made a point which has highlighted the ineptitude of the opposition in this respect. That is, he would have liked to have had some sensible negotiations. The two weeks have past and no offers have been made. What he has not spelt out to this chamber is that an approach was made and it <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3823"> was very clearly conveyed to the government that the opposition were not prepared to negotiate other than on the most unrealistic terms. That is, they put their peg down a very large distance from where the government wanted to be and indicated that that was that&mdash;we were either talking turkey at that level or we were out of the ballpark. So they in fact picked up their cards and walked away from the table.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="BOLKUS" NAMEID="XE4">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator Bolkus</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I don't think that's right.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is my understanding of it, and that is my description of it to this chamber. They did that without realising that in the end they would have to come back to the table and vote. They can do as they choose, but all the government can do is say, `We want to talk to you about this.' If we get the cold shoulder, if there is a clear indication that no real negotiations will take place, we will not waste our time talking with those parties anymore.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make another point: Senator Bolkus at least once, if not on other occasions, indicated that this aspect&mdash;that is, the cost of courts and tribunals&mdash;is the one critical issue where we can have a say vis-a-vis the cost of justice. With the greatest respect, he is mistaken in that view. The fees in courts and tribunals have a role to play in the cost of justice. But, as Senator Cooney would know&mdash;and as I and other senators in this place who participated in the cost of justice inquiry know&mdash;the fees of courts and tribunals are but a part of the high cost of justice. They are not the sole indicator of it. They, like the cost of justice itself, move with time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, the government wishes to oppose the disallowance motion as tabled by Senator Bolkus, but I do want to underline that the government&mdash;I in particular, along with other senators here&mdash;as I have indicated, has an abiding commitment to access to justice. We may go to that path by a different route than the previous government would have gone, but that does not mean we do not have that commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also committed to ensuring those who make use of government services make a reasonable contribution to the cost of those services. On attaining office, we were faced <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> with the legacy of the $8 billion black hole, the Beazley bankcard. This government was not afraid to take the decisions which had to be taken to deal with that legacy of our predecessors. We were not prepared to walk away from that black hole, as the previous government did. If we did walk away from it, we would be walking away from the weakest in our community, those who would benefit the most from having a government that has the strength of character to keep the fiscal matters in order.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the major commitments we made to the Australian people was a preparedness to make those hard decisions&mdash;they made the mess; we are prepared to fix it. We also said that, to the greatest extent possible, the pain would be shared across the whole community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One area where it seemed clear that an adequate contribution was not being made was in relation to those who use the resources of the Commonwealth's courts and tribunals, many of whom stand to make significant gains. Indeed, until the major increases levied by our predecessors on 1 January this year&mdash;and I just wonder whether Senator Bolkus was aware of that&mdash;the level of cost recovery in Commonwealth courts and tribunals had fallen from a high of almost 21 per cent in 1989 under a Labor government to about 12 per cent in 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the information of honourable senators, I might point out that the cost of running the Commonwealth's courts and tribunals has risen from about $81 million in 1989 to over $230 million in the current financial year. These are massive increases in outlays. The cost of running the Family Court alone has risen to in excess of $100 million per annum. Perhaps as an indication of the cost of providing these services one need only look at the Federal Court, which has estimated that it costs in excess of $6,000 a day to keep a judge in a court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To make some assessment of what was a reasonable contribution, the government looked at the average levels of cost recovery in the states and territories, and this averaged at about 30 per cent. We have taken decisions to move cost recovery across the Commonwealth system to that level. We continue to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3824"> believe that this assessment was not unreasonable. The increases were spread across all the courts and tribunals, but they were not uniform in their impact. The government recognised, for example, that the special nature of the Family Court and the matters it deals with mean the same fee levels should not apply to the Family Court as to the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes we enacted meant that the level of cost recovery in the Family Court was estimated to rise to only 23 per cent whereas the increases in the Federal Court would raise cost recovery in that court to in excess of 50 per cent. So the differences between the Family Court and the Federal Court, as highlighted by Senator Bolkus, were in fact acknowledged in the lesser cost recovery being sought by the government in the Family Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were concerned to ensure that the disadvantaged would not suffer because of these increases. At the same time as we moved to increase the level of cost recovery to its current estimates, we also moved to ensure that there was a uniform and fair system of exemptions and waivers in place to protect those who could not afford to pay. I remind the Senate that the Family Court now waives fees in approximately 40 per cent of the cases. Let us not pretend that every litigant in the Family Court is hard up. No-one pretends that, hopefully. Let us acknowledge that that court waives approximately 40 per cent. Clearly, those who cannot afford to pay, do not. This will continue to be the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having set out the government's reasoning in bringing in these fees, we are aware of concerns that have been expressed about some of the impacts that the fees as currently imposed may have. While these concerns have not been expressed across the whole community, there have been issues raised by those in the legal profession and some in other groups that the government is concerned to deal with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> We do not believe that there needs to be significant movement from the fundamental structure of the fees as currently imposed. They have been designed so that those who use more of the system's resources should make the greatest contribution. The new daily <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> fees for hearings in both the High Court and the Federal Court are examples of this approach. The introduction of a one-off hearing fee in the Family Court is another example.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I indicated earlier, the government has considered the concerns that have been expressed. I would like to outline now for honourable senators the revised position that the government believes will take account of many of those concerns. Some concerns have been expressed in relation to the new fee regime in the Family Court. The government attempted to restrict the increases in that court and will make further efforts in that regard. The major reason behind the introduction of the fees for ancillary relief and the one-off fee for hearings was to ensure that those who use the greatest share of the court's resources&mdash;those seeking additional relief and those taking matters to a hearing&mdash;should make a larger contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To partially offset this reduction, the government has decided to make a small additional increase to the fee for principal relief. The current fee will rise from $460 to $500. We propose to reduce the fee for ancillary relief from its current level of $250 to $150. Given the high level of waiver in the Family Court and the reduction in the fee, we believe that such a fee should be well within the reach of those who do not fall into the approximately 40 per cent of those whose fees are waived. In addition, the government will reduce the one-off hearing fee from $400 to $300 to reduce the impact of that fee.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To $300. In the Federal Court there will be a number of changes. Firstly, we will ensure that for unlawful dismissal matters, the fees payable in the Federal Court will be no higher than any payable for a similar matter in the Industrial Relations Commission under the new workplace relations legislation. There will be other reductions in fees in the Federal Court. The application fee for a non-corporate litigant will be reduced from $800 to $500 and from $1,600 to $1,200 for a corporate litigant. Applications to the court by creditors under the Bankruptcy Act will have the current fee reduced to the same level. The <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3825"> fees for lodging a cross-claim will be similarly reduced. I remind the Senate that there are no fees for the lodgment of a debtor's petition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The daily hearing fees will be reduced from $550 and $1,100 to $400 and $800 respectively. In addition, the first day of hearing will not incur a fee but will be regarded as being included within the setting down fee. Fees for setting a matter down for appeal will be reduced from $1,500 and $3,000 to $1,000 and $2,000 respectively. All other fees will remain the same.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I stated earlier, the government believes that this approach to the new fees in each of the courts and tribunals was reasonable and necessary in light of the difficult budgetary position that it found itself in. We have, however, made these significant concessions to deal with the express concerns. I point out that these concessions will significantly reduce the revenue expected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition has made much of its claims about the impact of the new fees. I could pick a number of significant holes in the figuring of Senator Bolkus in his worst case scenarios but, given the concessions made by the government, those scenarios will no longer even be a possibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to make some comment on those who repeatedly say that the courts are only for the wealthy or the very poor. It is a criticism regularly echoed by those who offer no evidence to support their sweeping claims. Indeed, Chief Justice Gleeson of the New South Wales Supreme Court noted in 1992 that, despite the claims I mentioned earlier, the great majority of litigants in his court appeared to be neither very rich nor very poor. Such evidence as there is suggests that most individual litigants come from middle income groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Making reasonable charges for the use of Commonwealth courts and tribunals does not deny access to those who need to use the system for the resolution of their disputes. For some only a system which is free of any fees would be appropriate. But for the vast bulk of the community there is support for those who can afford to make a contribution being obliged to do so.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that with the changes I have announced the government has struck an appropriate balance between the need for proper contributions to be made by those who stand to make often significant gains from the Commonwealth's courts and tribunals and the need for litigants to make a reasonable contribution to the costs of running the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dependent on the result of this debate, obviously, the government will move to make the necessary changes to the existing fees as from 1 September 1996, with the exception of the new fee for applications for divorce and nullity, which will operate as soon as the necessary changes to regulations can be made.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats will be supporting this motion to disallow what we see as an outrageous attempt to make the judiciary serve almost as a funding body for the executive. I take on board some of the comments made by the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) and that there is an intention by the coalition government to perhaps rework these fees and charges in some way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In light of the minister's suggestions, would it not be more appropriate for the government to withdraw the regulations that have been tabled and go back to the drawing board and work out a more appropriate and certainly fairer system of fees and charges? I am not convinced by the minister's offerings today to not support the disallowance before the chamber today. As I stated, the Australian Democrats will be supporting it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also very glad that Senator Bolkus has decided to pursue this disallowance now. We have expressed concern that this debate did not take place as originally scheduled a couple of weeks ago, for the very reason that Senator Bolkus made so well: people are paying these fees as we speak.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These regulations are also part of a broader campaign, as Senator Bolkus has said. Coupled with legal aid cuts, this government is stretching the capacity of our legal system well beyond its limits. I believe it is obvious that any hampering of a citizen's access to their courts is a hampering of democracy.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3826">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The judiciary exists as an essential and functioning arm of the government in this country. It is not a luxury that should be paid for. It is something that should be provided as a public utility. It should not be governed by privatisation, by user pays or undesirable corporatisation. I think that that is the direction in which the government is moving today with these regulations. It is, along with the legislature and the executive, part of our functioning and constitutional government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has made no bones about the fact that it expects the judiciary to provide a greater cost recovery process. Once again, user pays. As Senator Bolkus said, `user pays' is a term that should have no place in the justice system in this country. I could not agree more. The Democrats share this view. We do not support the philosophy of user pays.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe very much that the ability to walk into a court and have your grievances dealt with in a fair, efficient and just way is actually a right of citizenship. It is not a luxury. It is not an extravagance. Senator Bolkus has outlined many of the costs and how in many cases the fees are exorbitant and prohibitive. In some cases, the fees that we discussed today represent a 172 per cent increase for individuals and as much as a 443 per cent increase for corporate Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to the Australian Democrats, the most disturbing aspect of this money grab by the government is that it will negatively impact upon families, those families who are using the Family Court's jurisdiction. Incidents of domestic violence and child abuse are some of the most disturbing dimensions of what happens when a family becomes dysfunctional. The proposition that health care card holders will be given exemption denies the fact that not all deserving cases will be holding health care cards. I cannot think of anything more abhorrent than a woman who is suffering from domestic violence in the home having to argue her case, having to argue why she should be exempt from filing fees.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed regulations do permit the court's registrar to waive the $500 fee on the ground that a payment of the fee would pose financial hardship on the person.</PARA>
<PARA>Here is the clincher:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But why should people be subjected to the additional process by having to apply for an exemption to that fee?</PARA>
<PARA>Why, indeed. The answer can only be because the government sees litigants, be they individuals or large corporations&mdash;any user of the Family Court&mdash;as easy targets from which to squeeze more money. Democracy is not a soft target. It should not be a soft target for economic rationalism. Access to the courts, as has been stated by Senator Bolkus, is a right of democracy. It is access to democracy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should note that the ALP and the coalition both performed policy backflips, as evidenced in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Journals of the Senate</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 3 March 1992. The coalition actually supported the Democrats' disallowance motion against the then government's attempt to hike up the fees. How times have changed. Clearly, the coalition has changed its position&mdash;lost the plot, we might say. But we are quite happy that the ALP in opposition has <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3827"> seen the light. Unfortunately, though, the coalition is reneging, going back on their 1992 position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Vanstone in this place today said that part of the cost recovery effort is to share the pain across the community when dealing with the so-called $8 billion deficit. The traditionally powerless and the lower socioeconomic groups seem disproportionately targeted, not only by these measures but by many of the budget deficit reduction strategy measures. So I dispute the minister's claims here today that the burden and pain is being shared equally because I have yet to see evidence of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that the minister will stay true to the words she spoke in this place today that she and the coalition have an `abiding commitment' to accessing justice in our community. I only hope that they demonstrate that deep and abiding commitment today by at least withdrawing these regulations. Certainly, the only party that has remained consistent on this issue is the Australian Democrats. We will continue to do so. We will support the disallowance motion before us today.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to join this debate just to clear up a few matters that have been raised. The previous contributor to this debate raised the very emotional aspect of domestic violence applications. If the honourable senator was aware of restraint orders that are made&mdash;I do not know how often or on what regular basis I used to do restraint orders on behalf of clients&mdash;she would know that they are filed 99.9 per cent in the state jurisdictions because they are so much quicker and cheaper. To get a domestic violence restraint order in the Family Court these days is virtually unheard of. These days emergency ones are quite often brought by the state police or, indeed, by private practitioners but in the state jurisdiction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While it is, with respect, a convenient and emotional argument to latch onto, it is fundamentally flawed because, with what is before the Senate this evening, we are not dealing with a federal jurisdiction. If we are to get into this debate and try to pick on emotional <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> areas, let us make sure that we get our facts right. With respect to the contribution that we have just had, it was wrong, wrong, wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was further suggested by the previous contributor to this debate that this was an outrageous attempt to try to grab money from those less fortunate within the community. Madam Acting Deputy President, you have to ask yourself the question: how many people do you put into that category when you take cognisance of the fact that 40 per cent of people making application to the Family Court get their fees waived already? Are you going to say that there are more than 40 per cent of the population who are underprivileged? I do not think that argument is sustainable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at the usage of the Family Court in particular, which is the one area that has excited a degree of interest, the socioeconomic range within the community at large is, in fact, reflected in the Family Court. Those who we might say are very poor as a percentage of the community use the Family Court just as much as those whom we might call absolutely filthy rich; they use the Family Court according to their percentage as represented within the community. I do not think we can honestly argue that this will hurt those in the lower socioeconomic group, unless you assert that in excess of 40 per cent ought be considered to be in that category. With the greatest of respect, I do not think that that argument is sustainable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were then told that there are some people who are clearly unable to afford the fees but who would not necessarily be in possession of a Medicare card or a health benefit card which would provide automatic waiver of fees. That is correct. But what the family courts are preparing&mdash;and this used to be the case, I might add; those of us who practised in the jurisdiction who are not dealing with cheap political points but with the facts and know what occurred are aware that this used to happen&mdash;is a form that you simply fill in stating your financial circumstances. It used to be the case that, on face value, the details stated on that form were accepted as being the truth, and the registry would then waive the fee. You would simply <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3828"> have to swear it in front of a JP&mdash;a very simple form that could be filled in very quickly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, those accessing the Family Court have to fill out and sign forms in front of a Justice of the Peace or whomever in any event, before they can actually lodge documents and get an appointment with the Family Court. So it will not be any extra work, and the person who is making application for the waiver of fees will not be put on the stand to be cross-examined by the Registrar of the Family Court to see whether or not they have told the truth in that form. Of course, a penalty ought apply in the event that they are shown to have misled the court. But that really is not something that is likely to occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If, as expressed, there is all this moral outrage about these fee increases, Madam Acting Deputy President, you have to ask the question: why wasn't there this same moral outrage previously? If we look at the cost recovery rate within the community at large, we see, for example, that in the High Court in 1992-93 the cost recovery rate was 3.3 per cent; it will go up to about 8.9 per cent. In the Federal Court where we might be looking at about 53.9 per cent, do you know what the recovery was in 1989-90? Fifty three per cent. Under the Labor regime, they were pursuing 53 per cent cost recovery rate from the Federal Court&mdash;yet they come in here only a matter of seven years later beating their breasts about the injustice of a cost recovery of an extra 0.9 per cent. How shallow, how hollow, is that sort of assertion when confronted with the facts of what their administration used to engage in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very easy to get emotive about these issues. I am simply trying to provide some facts and figures, and set out how the system has worked in the past. In 1989-90 the Family Court had a cost recovery rate of 17.9 per cent; under our proposals, it will slip up to 22.5 per cent&mdash;hardly the sort of percentage increase that would make people pull out their hair. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal had a 2.1 per cent cost recovery; our proposals would increase that by one per cent to 3.1 per cent. It is hardly anything of great moment that we are discussing.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does perturb me that I need to make a comment about the submission of the Law Council of Australia because I am, in fact, a member of it and the family law division. As Senator McKiernan would know, I asked a question at Senate estimates in relation to the quite emotive letter of the Law Council of Australia about the consequences of these fees. Let me read to you what they wrote to honourable senators. In the second paragraph of a document dated 6 September 1996, they stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In particular, the Law Council of Australia and its Family Law Section are deeply concerned at the impact the new fees in the Family Court will have on families already struggling with the inevitable economic consequences of marriage breakdown.</PARA>
<PARA>Keeping in mind that the first 40 per cent of the lowest socioeconomic groupings will be exempt in any event, you have to ask yourself: how are the family law fees that lawyers charge set? Unless there is an agreement outside of the regulations, we are required to charge as per the regulations of the Family Law Act. And do you know what? Each year or every two years, whenever there has been a fee increase for lawyers, which will impact and have the inevitable economic consequences on these struggling families, not once have they complained and said, `These poor struggling families cannot afford our fees.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Law Council of Australia has always accepted the fee increases for its membership and accepted that as being completely acceptable and reasonable. I have to say to you, all in all, that that is a reasonable attitude for them to take. But when they themselves accept the fee increases they cannot then turn around and beat their breasts, and prevent the government&mdash;indeed, we not talking about the government as such but the average Australian taxpayer&mdash;from trying to get some cost recovery back from a system that those people are using.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that we as a government would prefer that nobody access the Family Law courts&mdash;that people could come to some arrangement between themselves. If they cannot come to that sort of arrangement, they want the benefit of a taxpayer funded mechanism called the Family Court of Australia. But the question has to be asked: why should <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3829"> that total burden fall on the taxpayers at large without there being a contribution from those who are unable to come to a resolution? Of course, if you do make an application and you are successful, there is always the possibility of getting an award for costs against the other party, so those fees that may have been paid up&hyphen;front can potentially be recovered. I suggest to my friends in the Law Council of Australia that it is somewhat disingenuous to accept fee increases for yourself but then deny the taxpayers of Australia the same right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A previous contributor in this debate made comment about the opposition's policy backflip on this and also the government's policy backflip in relation to these fees. When we were in opposition and joined forces to disallow some of the increases in fees that were being pursued by the then government, we on this side said that we were not necessarily opposed to some measure of cost recovery where this would enhance sound management of the judicial system. We are on the public record as saying that we do not oppose fee increases per se, just as long as they can be shown to be of general benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you look at the state jurisdictions having, in general, a cost recovery of approximately 30 per cent from the users, there are no cries from those on the opposite side that that is somehow inherently unjust. If it is not inherently unjust for the states to get a 30 per cent cost recovery from their judicial system, why is it that it is somehow inherently unjust for the Commonwealth to do so? That really is the argument that they have to put up in this place to try to convince those people who are genuinely thinking through the real issues on a logical basis&mdash;not those motivated by politics or cheap calling upon the emotions of domestic violence and other very unfortunate situations that we face within this community. We will be looking for the answer as to why it is not inherently unjust for the states but somehow it would be for the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say to those opposite that Senator Michael Tate, a former senator from my home state of Tasmania&mdash;who, I note, wants to enter the priesthood after having resigned his ambassadorial position to the Netherlands and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Holy See&mdash;said in the disallowance debates in 1992:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But, basically, the fees are being levied in order to assist the Federal Government to discharge its obligation to fund the system of justice, which we are obliged to do if our society is to remain one governed by the rule of law, and the contribution, running into some millions of dollars, certainly would be very helpful in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA>He then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It may well be that $500 for a hearing in the Federal Court of Australia when one is paying thousands of dollars a day for counsel is not an extravagant amount at all. It could well be increased to help defray the costs which are otherwise borne by&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>who did Senator Tate say?&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the ordinary taxpayers of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>Those opposite try to be critical of us by saying that this is a grab by government for money. It is not a grab by the government because, if we as a government do not get the money, who foots the bill? That is something that those opposite still fail to grasp. That is why they got this country into such a horrible economic mess. They only thought about government, and if the government did not raise the money, well, they put it on bankcard. The reality is that one day the chickens do come home to roost, and who has to foot the bill? It is going to be our fellow Australians&mdash;the taxpayers whom we are obliged to represent in this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that we owe a duty to encourage people not to use the system and if they do avail themselves of a taxpayer funded system to make some, albeit very small, contribution to the overall facility that is thus provided by the ordinary taxpayers of Australia. Those who want to use the court system&mdash;and I accept that the vast majority of them don't but circumstances unfortunately make it such that they find themselves within that predicament&mdash;ought to make a contribution if they can afford it, and that is a very important caveat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a lot of other matters that can be raised but what I think the salient point for those opposite to come to grips with is: why is it okay for states to get a 30 per cent cost recovery but somehow inherently not for the Commonwealth to do so? Why is it just for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3830"> the ordinary Australian taxpayer, the battlers out there, to help fund and subsidise, especially in the Federal Court jurisdiction, those actions that have been taken by companies against each other and have reduced filing fees in that jurisdiction? It really does defy logic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other matter&mdash;and I think this is the most serious one&mdash;is in the family law jurisdiction where 40 per cent of those users accessing the Family Court already get all the fees waived. Are you going to tell us that more than 40 per cent of the community are somehow in a poverty trap that they cannot make a contribution? If that is your argument, it is a very real indictment on the mess that you left this country in on 2 March when the government of this country was handed over to us courtesy of the Australian electors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You cannot sustain that argument. If you did, it would show you people up in a light that I am sure you would not want to be in. Even those of us on this side who accuse you of economic mismanagement would never go as far as to say that virtually 50 per cent of the population was somehow put into a poverty trap by the previous 13 years of the Labor government. There really are some fairly fundamental issues that those on the opposite side have to come to grips with if they are to sustain their argument against these fees.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>I cannot recall any report presented to this parliament with such a huge list of failings of dereliction of duty by an element of the Public Service&mdash;in essence, that is what the Civil Aviation Authority was at the time, even though it was classified as a government business enterprise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not a lawyer like Senator Cooney and I do not know the precise legal meaning of the phrase that I am going to use to describe the actions of the Civil Aviation Authority, but as a layman the Civil Aviation Authority is culpable of criminal negligence. It does not give me any pleasure to say this but if Senator Collins were in the chamber he would confirm I have been making the point for many years that there are grave and crucial inadequacies in the administration of the regulatory authority in Australia with respect to aviation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This huge report&mdash;I have been unable to put it down, but I have not got terribly far with it; the first 100 pages or so makes fascinating <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3831"> reading in the way it details all these shortcomings&mdash;relates to the loss of an Aero Commander aircraft operated by Seaview on 2 October 1994. In a speech I made in this chamber a couple of days later, I instanced three points that were grave areas of deficiency in the regulatory authority. I said at the time:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most difficult area in Australian aviation is undoubtedly the charter operators&mdash;the third level operators. That is the hardest area in which to make money.</PARA>
<PARA>Later on I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The three common faults in this cash strapped area of aircraft operations are: overloading of aircraft, which is very common; an extension of duty times for aircrew way beyond the statutory level; and inadequate maintenance. The CAA ought to be putting its surveillance activities into that area in order to protect the travelling public.</PARA>
<PARA>This report two years later essentially finds that they were the three critical shortcomings that we faced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are in this mess because the Labor Party through its years in government adopted the economic rationalist argument of cost recovery. That reached its high point between 1990 and 1992. It is interesting to see in this report from page 91 onwards in chapter 3 where the consequences of this cost recovery doctrine are laid out starkly. It shows that this had its origins in the user-pays doctrine at the time, when the industry was seen as the customer and that the customer must be pleased at all times.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I pointed out over the years when this doctrine was being run, the user-pays doctrine is false in relation to aviation. The glib argument from the government of the day was that, if people want to fly in aeroplanes as passengers, then they should pay for the full service. I argued consistently through all those years that there is a public interest component in aviation, that the community benefits in many ways, and that, particularly from a regulatory point of view, that is a function that should be funded, in part or in whole, by the public purse. You do not ask people in the community to pay directly for every service the police force renders. In many ways the Civil Aviation Authority, the regulator of the industry, is in the same position.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are now seeing the failure of that doctrine written large. Tragically, it has been seen in the case of two very serious accidents where a large number of lives were lost&mdash;the Monarch aviation crash and the Seaview crash, which this report deals with. The problem still remains with us because, although the CAA has become CASA, the regulatory authority is no better today than it was then. I hope this Senate passes an amendment to the act which allows the board to be changed and puts people of professional ability onto it. The real problem lies within the CAA administration itself.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a report from the Department of Industrial Relations entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Enterprise bargaining in Australia</EMPHASIS> . It is an annual report for the year 1995 and it covers section 107RC of the Industrial Relations Act 1988. The period for this report appears to conclude at the end of June this year. Unfortunately for the Senate, this report on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>  has an asterisk alongside it, which means that copies of this report are available only when this item is called on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think this is an important report because it is a report into the incidence and nature of workplace or enterprise bargaining in Australia over, effectively, the last financial year. What lies at the very heart of all of the debate that this nation has been engaged in on industrial relations changes is whether or not the existing act&mdash;the act introduced by the previous Labor government&mdash;is conducive to enterprise bargaining with the proper balance of protections for low paid workers and protections for workers in vulnerable positions in society and whether or not progress has been made under that act for enterprise bargaining in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have not had a chance to read this report. I certainly think the Senate should take note of it. I intend to read it and speak in greater detail on its findings at a later time. But what <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3832"> can be said about it now is this: that, under the previous government, workplace bargaining or enterprise bargaining had been growing apace. The essential lie on which the government's legislation turns is that there had been slow movement in the industrial relations culture and that workplace bargaining had been ineffective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I think this report will show if it analyses the issues as fully as I believe the statistics demonstrate is that workplace bargaining in the public sector in Australia where the federal industrial relations act held sway had been particularly strong when compared with the conservatively governed states, where the look&hyphen;alike acts that this government now proposes to enact federally had applied. Workplace bargaining had been slow in those states by comparison. Indeed, the take&hyphen;up of workers in a fair system, the system that applied, had been greater than in a draconian system where unfairness ruled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point is about the public sector. My understanding of the statistics in the public sector show a similar situation&mdash;that workers were readier to enter into enterprise bargains where they perceived the system to be fair compared with states where they have draconian look&hyphen;alike legislation to the federal legislation that is currently before the federal parliament. That says quite a lot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report is fundamental to any critical analysis of progress in industrial relations therefore because the central theme of workplace or enterprise bargaining is to engage workers and their employers in fair bargains in a manner which will create productivity, a greater return to shareholders, greater job security and a return to employees. That is, both sides of the management divide&mdash;if I can use what I think should be an archaic term but is coming back into more common usage now under this government&mdash;would see a common interest in growing the productivity of their enterprise so that they could share the benefits of that productivity growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> If it is done unfairly, one side will not play ball. If it is done fairly, both sides can and the economy benefits. This report&mdash;and we have just got it now; we have not had a chance to analyse it&mdash;should set out statistically the de tails of how you could compare the two systems. I think, therefore, it is quite an important report and should go to a lot of the debate this chamber is about to experience on this bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Considering that the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill is currently before the Senate&mdash;a bill which promotes individual agreements over enterprise bargaining&mdash;this is, as Senator Cook said, a most valuable report. It allows us the opportunity to compare the success of enterprise bargaining agreements conducted under part 6B of the act with the success, or otherwise, of individual agreements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my home state, Western Australia, the Court government has had individual agreements in workplaces for a number of years. At the Senate Economics References Committee, the commissioner of workplace agreements in that state provided a report on those workplace agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us then compare these two reports, looking firstly at the annual report on enterprise bargaining, which was tabled today by the Department of Industrial Relations. The report says that enterprise bargaining has been adopted in a huge number of workplaces&mdash;from 39 per cent in those with 20 to 49 employees to 87 per cent in those with over 500 employees. Forty-six per cent of these are private sector workplaces; 54 per cent are public sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Enterprise bargaining has been taken up in a strong way amongst every sector of the economy&mdash;from 28 per cent in accommodation, cafes and restaurants to 81 per cent in electricity, gas and water. When one looks at the results of enterprise bargaining, it is no wonder so many companies have become involved. Sixty-two per cent of managers reported an increase in labour productivity after entering into an enterprise agreement, with no manager reporting a decrease. Interestingly, the same figure, 62 per cent, of enterprise agreements awarded wage rises based upon productivity increases. In 1995, the average raw wage increase per agreement was 8.3 per cent.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3833">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of profitability, 47 per cent of managers reported an increase in profits under an enterprise agreement and only 11 per cent reported a decrease. Furthermore, 50 per cent of managers reported an increase in the quality of their product, with none reporting a decrease. Forty-five per cent of managers said workers' skills had increased, with again none reporting a decrease. Skill development, as we all know, is an important contributor to productivity growth, and productivity growth is the major way&mdash;if not the only way&mdash;to raise real living standards over time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Wages have also increased under enterprise bargaining. In 1995, 59 per cent of workers under an enterprise agreement reported an increase in weekly wages, with only two per cent reporting a decrease. Both employers and employees have reported their satisfaction with the enterprise bargaining system. Overall, 74 per cent of workplace managers said they were happy with the introduction of enterprise agreements. In terms of overall job satisfaction, 63 per cent of employees were satisfied after enterprise bargaining, and only 12 per cent were dissatisfied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Enterprise bargaining, under the present system under the Commonwealth act, is achieving strong results&mdash;real win-win situations for employers and workers. The reason for this is simple: enterprise bargaining as we know it today promotes cooperation between employers and employees. It breaks down the old idea of divisiveness that unfortunately used to rule the Australian workplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us now turn to the report of the commissioner of workplace agreements to see how individual agreements under a Liberal government compare in Western Australia. According to his figures, in 83 per cent of cases, employees reported a wage rise, compared to 4.5 per cent who reported a decrease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, one must be very careful when looking simply at these end figures because of the methodology of the workplace agreements report. It does not arrive at this figure out of a solid statistical analysis, as the report of the Department of Industrial Relations does. Rather, this figure from Western Australia comes from the commissioner's staff asking the employee's opinion, before the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> agreement is registered, of whether they feel their wages are higher. There are no calculations of all the benefits of penalties, conditions and other entitlements. So, on the surface, a quick glance at the base rate may appear to indicate a rise. However, when all factors are considered by a true statistical analysis, the figure is much lower.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Wages are not the only indicator of whether or not a worker is better off. Over 50 per cent of workers reported an increase in hours worked&mdash;over twice as many as under the federal enterprise bargaining system. These longer working hours are particularly harsh when one considers that 40 per cent of the workers had their penalty rates for overtime eliminated, and nearly 55 per cent of workers lost their penalty rates for work within ordinary time. In almost 70 per cent of cases&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Enterprise Bargaining in Australia</EMPHASIS>  1995 annual report, which was prepared by the Department of Industrial Relations. This excellent report provides an important snapshot of how enterprise bargaining is developing in Australia. The comprehensiveness of this report, building on the base of the first one in 1994, is a credit to the researchers and ensures the report makes a valuable and timely contribution to the industrial relations debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Department of Industrial Relations is required to produce this report annually because of section 170RC of the Industrial Relations Act. This section was the result of a successful Democrat amendment to the Brereton reform bill in 1993. It requires an annual report on the implementation of enterprise bargaining and its impacts on the employment conditions of employees, particularly women, part-time workers and migrants. This is the second report prepared by DIR and is based on a substantially bigger database than the first report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The findings of the report provide both good news and bad news. The good news is that enterprise bargaining is spreading and that workers and managers are basically happy with it. The bad news is that the benefits of enterprise bargaining are not <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3834"> evenly spread and that women workers and workers in non&hyphen;unionised workplaces are losing out. I am quite concerned that the gap between male and female hourly earnings widened by 1.4 per cent in 1995, that women reported a larger increase in hours worked than did men, and that this trend was more evident in state employment agreements than in federal certified agreements. This highlights the need for detailed vetting of enterprise agreements to ensure that workers in a disadvantaged bargaining position&mdash;such as women&mdash;are not disadvantaged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that unionised workplaces were far more likely than non&hyphen;unionised workplaces to have enterprise agreements and that over 70 per cent of managers and 63 per cent of employees reported satisfaction with federal enterprise agreements shows that union involvement does not mean bargaining is stymied. It also shows that non&hyphen;unionists are failing to achieve the benefits of enterprise bargaining and highlights the need for the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 to encourage the effective operation of unions and for enterprise bargaining to be promoted in the non&hyphen;unionised workplace by both unions and the Employment Advocate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Overall, the report shows that enterprise bargaining is gaining increasing acceptance in Australia and that federal certified agreements are a more productive, fair and satisfactory means of achieving agreements than state agreements such as those in Victoria and Western Australia. Indeed, the level of industrial disputation was higher under state employment agreements, where unions were often excluded, than under federal employment agreements where they were included.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The report shows that far too many employers were still requiring employees to work harder rather than smarter and that this was affecting family life. There is a direct correlation between an increase in work intensity and stress and a decline in the ability to balance work and family issues. Closer attention needs to be paid to work and family issues in industrial relations to ensure that productivity is not at the expense of family life. The Democrats believe this report high lights the value of regular reporting on major reform issues and provides some strong messages which the government should take into account in modifying its workplace relations bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that this legislative approach of regular reporting on major reform initiatives should be adopted in other areas where governments make huge and grandiose claims of massive benefits to test whether the benefits ever turn up or whether governments need to keep a watching brief on critical issues such as this. I note in passing that the workplace relations bill proposes to repeal section 170RC and to replace this very detailed and specific report with a more generalised report every three years. This is an approach the Democrats have serious concerns with. Governments must be prepared to have their reforms tested rigorously; this is an important part of the accountability process. I commend this report to the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the motion to take note of the report. In doing so I want to say that I have not had a full opportunity to review all the commentaries in the report, but I want to touch upon a number of matters which I think are relevant to it. Firstly, in terms of the process that it reviews, I can say that I have had first&hyphen;hand experience in establishing registered agreements under the federal legislation. I have also had experience with the establishment&mdash;either directly or indirectly&mdash;of agreements under the Tasmanian industrial legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to agreements established under the existing federal legislation, I am able to say that the rigorous testing which the previous government required prior to the registration of the certified agreements was a form of testing which guaranteed that full consultation took place and that all the issues of concern to the variety of parties&mdash;present and future&mdash;which might be affected by an agreement were given proper consideration and vetted by the commission. It is important to understand that the system that is being reported upon in this report was one which was subject to rigorous tests by the federal Industrial Relations Commission to establish not only was <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3835"> an agreement made but also that there was proper consultation and that the various interest groups who might be affected by it had properly been considered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that, in the proposed Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996, a number of those tests will disappear for the limited certified agreement role which is intended to exist with the implementation of the new legislation. I can say that the legislation currently in existence has facilitated agreements which I have been involved in relating to special conditions and special leave pertaining to family arrangements for workers in child&hyphen;care centres, for establishing landmark conditions for workers with disabilities working in the laundry industry and also for dealing generally with industrial prescriptions for manufacturing workers in a number of industries. So it is a very flexible system that we are operating under at the moment under the federal jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot, however, say the same for the system which has been established by the Tasmanian Liberal government and which exists now, although it is subject to review by an inquiry of the Tasmanian House of Assembly at the moment. I would categorise that system as one which does not involve a true bargaining process and, indeed, the very simple tests to test that bargaining process do not establish the fairness of the system. The previous Tasmanian enterprise commissioner has expressed to the inquiry which was conducted by the Tasmanian House of Assembly his dissatisfaction with that legislation because he was not able to satisfy himself that the outcome of the agreements which he was required to register under the legislation was fair and equitable or that the bargaining process was proper and fair. That is a problem with agreements which are being struck under that type of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many similarities between the Tasmanian legislation as it now stands and the workplace relations bill which is currently being debated in the Senate. Those similarities will need, obviously, to be highlighted when the debate is conducted and concluded. Consideration will have to be given to the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> actual effects of those types of measures that we can point to in states such as Tasmania and Western Australia when we have a look at the provisions in the workplace relations bill and the Senate determines how in practice the measures in the workplace relations bill will impact upon the workplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Enterprise bargaining is not a new term&mdash;it has gone on for all of this century, whether or not we have called it enterprise bargaining. Having been involved with an employee organisation since 1974, I can say that, for all of that period, the organisation was involved in enterprise bargaining. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to take a few minutes of the Senate tonight to talk about the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Iron Baron</EMPHASIS>  clean&hyphen;up. A little over a year ago a ship carrying $3.5 million worth of manganese hit Hebe Reef off the mouth of the Tamar River on the north coast of Tasmania. Initially, 300,000 litres of oil escaped from the fuel tanks and a further 25,000 were spilt into the sea as the hulk was lifted off the reef. An oil slick spread out over the reef and the surrounding coastline, extending eight kilometres up the Tamar River. Smaller traces of oil were spotted up to 15 kilometres upriver, 35 kilometres north&hyphen;east as far as Ninth Island and 30 kilometres west to Port Sorell.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3836">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An immense clean&hyphen;up operation was commenced immediately, involving hundreds of people from many organisations working in close cooperation. The response to the oil spill was managed under the national plan to combat pollution of the sea by oil, led by the Port of Launceston Authority and joined by BHP's oil spill response group. Eight months after the accident, the Premier of Tasmania at the time, the Hon. Ray Groom, commended BHP for being `an outstanding corporate citizen'. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They accepted at the outset full responsibility for the oil spill and took action to do this.</PARA>
<PARA>BHP had said from the beginning that it would not leave the job until the clean&hyphen;up was completed, and it certainly did not. Once the initial clean&hyphen;up was largely accomplished, BHP funded a $900,000 long&hyphen;term management and maintenance plan. Under this plan the short&hyphen;term and long&hyphen;term effects of the oil spill on the surrounding environment and the success of the measures taken to restore the environment have become the subject of intense and careful organised study.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Contracts were let to organisations based in Tasmania, including the University of Tasmania, the Queen Victoria Museum, the CSIRO Division of Oceanography and government departments. Professor Michael Cullen of Monash University was also commissioned to undertake research. The interim report from the long&hyphen;term impact assessment group was released a couple of months ago and brings to light some interesting results.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The results so far indicate that oil sediment at most locations has now returned to pre&hyphen;spill levels and the oil which contaminated rocks in the affected areas has weathered naturally and is disappearing. There appears to be no evidence now of contamination in fish and shellfish arising from the spill. At this stage, there appears to be no major impact on the seagrass beds in the Tamar River. Most of the initial impact of the oil spill on local beaches appears to have been short&hyphen;lived.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Plants and animals living in habitats along the shoreline were affected by the spill in the short term and the assessment of their recovery is still taking place. Preliminary data indicates there has been a definite impact on <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> penguin populations, but the extent will only be known in the coming months as the penguins enter their new breeding cycle. The population of penguins will recover over time, according to Dr Simon Stanley from the marine environment branch of the Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries and chairman of the long&hyphen;term impact assessment group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> It is hard to calculate the size of the original penguin colonies. It is estimated that the region had about 140,000 birds before the oil spill from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Iron Baron</EMPHASIS>. Immediately after the grounding, more than 2,000 birds were treated at Low Head, 300 of which died. A further 20,000 may have died at sea. But, even so, this is still very few considering the overall population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the Low Head rookery, last year's breeding cycle was lost, but the effect of the spill will not be known until this year's cycle is completed in September. No oil related effects have been detected on Hebe Reef or the other reefs in the area, although an area of approximately 170 metres by 20 metres was physically damaged by the ship. On the Hebe Reef itself there appears to be a slow recovery of animal and plant communities taking place and fish populations have returned to normal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The quick and effective response by local volunteer groups working with specialists from BHP and the government has been the main factor in bringing about a remarkably quick environmental recovery. Other spin&hyphen;off benefits have been the detailed study which eventuated and which will be used for further research. The process used to implement the clean&hyphen;up and the recovery strategy is now a model for any future oil spills in Australian waters. Another benefit is that the environmental resources, which were not known before, have now been identified and are being monitored.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to take this opportunity to commend those who have been involved in the clean&hyphen;up operations and the very high standard of their expertise. The effective management of the disaster has limited the negative impact and brought considerable benefits. For example, on 2 February this year, the Low Head Pilot Station at the mouth of the River Tamar, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3837"> which had been the sight of the wildlife rescue and treatment facility, was officially handed back to the Port of Launceston Authority, although it had been closed as a wildlife sanctuary back in September. The historic buildings were badly in need of restoration and, as part of its promise to return everything to its previous condition, BHP offered not only to return the grounds to their former standard but also to significantly upgrade the reserve. This project has now been completed and is attracting added interest from the tourists wanting to learn more about the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Iron Baron</EMPHASIS> incident.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The pilot station was built in 1835 and is surrounded by historical buildings which were in need of much work in order to realise their heritage potential. So heritage enhancement tasks undertaken by BHP between September and February included building of a cobblestone type road leading to the station, putting powerlines underground to improve the aesthetics of the area, installing heritage style lighting along the road and also landscaping and regrassing the entire area. BHP also created a display in consultation with the Port of Launceston Authority to be permanently set up inside their museum, which is in the main pilot station building. Some painting was also undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I want to thank the many volunteers who freely gave of their time and effort in the very difficult and time consuming task of rescuing and cleaning penguins and other birds, rehabilitating the coastline and undertaking other tasks, all of which have contributed to returning the coastline to its pre&hyphen;spill condition. I thank the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<STATE> (Queensland)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(7.23 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I want to recount a particular incident that disturbed me in my office in North Queensland last fortnight. I had a call from a gentleman who had a particular problem. I do not need to go into that particular problem, but he was rather distressed. In explaining what I had to do about the problem, that I had to refer it to state government because it was actually a state government matter, he got very distressed and said, `Of course, you federal politicians, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> you're not interested in me. I came from Germany 20 years ago and you're not interested in me.' I had to spend some considerable time on the phone explaining to him that it had nothing to do with his cultural background; it was more the processes of government and that, in order to assist him, I had to deal with the issue through a state government department, which I subsequently did.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It occurred to me that, if, here in North Queensland a person who had been in Australia for 20 years and is of German background was feeling so vulnerable as to accuse me of discrimination and disinterest&mdash;whatever you like to call it&mdash;how would our more recent migrants be feeling in the current climate after the debate that has occurred following Pauline Hanson's speech?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That prompted me to go back to some work that first started in this place on 9 May, when the Senate accepted a motion of mine after a particularly rare and harmonious debate on a controversial matter. It was a motion that I had brought forward about considering a code of ethics. I would like to remind senators of what the Senate accepted, and I want to qualify it for a number of members in the chamber. The resolution states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) condemns the use of any racial material to manipulate public opinion during election campaigns;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) reminds parliamentarians that they are elected to represent all of their constituents and that it is totally reprehensible for any parliamentarian to announce that they will refuse to represent a particular group&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That was quite specifically in response to Ms Hanson, who had said very early in her parliamentary career that she would not represent indigenous people. The resolution then referred to: . . . developing a code of race ethics to be observed by all members of the national parliament in the interest of community harmony.</PARA>
<PARA>It is true that government members were very supportive of the first two clauses, but had some reservations about the final clause relating to a code of race ethics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, this issue has been pursued and I would like to particularly thank the minister for Aboriginal affairs, John Herron, and his <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3838"> office; my colleague Daryl Melham; and my colleague John Woodley who, together with a number of community and church leaders, have assisted in working through some of the issues to now circulate this week a voluntary code of race ethics for federal parliamentarians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to emphasise, as I did the last time I debated this issue in this place, that this is not about political point scoring. This is not about pointing the finger at who may or may not agree and who will and will not sign. As I go through some of the details, I hope that a number of members and senators across the political spectrum will be prepared to give these commitments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am backed in this hope by the Hon. Kevin Rozzoli, who actually proposed a 12&hyphen;item list as a guideline for a code for members of parliament. This was back in 1991. He addressed the pecuniary interests issue which, of course, we have already adopted. But as well, he identified that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> A Member should act in the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> A Member should always act in a manner which upholds the dignity of public office and the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> A Member should treat all persons seeking assistance without discrimination.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> A Member should make every endeavour to assist those who seek help, consistent with the need and urgency of the matter and its relevance to the jurisdiction within which the member operates.</PARA>
<PARA>That was on the public record as early as 1991. Other work has been done in regard to a code of conduct for parliamentarians; it is probably because, as a profession, sadly, we do not have the respect of the electorates and the Australian community at large that I think we all deserve. I say that across party lines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Four of the key issues in `Attitudes to federal politicians' published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> in September showed that 84 per cent agreed with the statement: `Federal politicians lie at election time to win votes'; 79 per cent said federal politicians cannot be trusted to keep election promises; 91 per cent said federal politicians twist the truth to suit their own arguments; and 95 per cent said federal politicians should stop arguing with each other and concentrate more on running the country. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> They are not saying which political parties. We are all in this together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John Warhurst has done some work. In the conclusion of the Catholic Social Justice Series <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Politicians and Citizens: roles and responsibilities</EMPHASIS> he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The theme of this paper is that politicians and citizens have not dissimilar responsibilities and that politics&mdash;whether it be from the perspective of politician or citizen&mdash;is an honourable, noble vocation. The common good can only be achieved if all people are willing to contribute their talents to `organised, purposeful activity for the welfare of society and of particular groups in society in view of the common good'. This is politics.</PARA>
<PARA>Another group that you may think are not specifically concerned with ethics, certainly a code of race ethics, is the commercial television industry. I take this opportunity to congratulate the commercial television industry on their code of practice and ask them why they do not insist that their commercial radio equivalent, particularly talkback radio, operate on a similar code of practice. They have some advisory notes about portrayal of cultural diversity. Their code states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. Be sensitive to language and images which people from non-English speaking backgrounds or minority racial groups may reasonably find offensive or discriminatory.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. When reporting or portraying events involving people with racial backgrounds which differ from your own, you should be conscious of your own preconceptions and be sensitive to the cultural norms and experiences of those people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. Any reports on race-related issues should be well researched, and not based solely on the claims of particular groups.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4. The religious and cultural beliefs and practices of people from non-English speaking . . . backgrounds should receive no less respect than those of the English-speaking majority.</PARA>
<PARA>Putting together some of the views expressed in the debate, this particular voluntary code of race ethics for federal parliamentarians is being circulated. I seek leave to table the document.</PARA>

<STATE> (Queensland)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(7.34 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to take some moments of the Senate's time on the adjournment debate tonight to complete the few points I was making during presentation of documents an hour or so ago with respect to the royal commission inquiry into the Seaview accident. I was saying that the cost recovery policies of the Civil Aviation Authority, which was the regulatory authority of the time, had its origins in Labor government policies of the user pays doctrine of the mid-1980s, and that the application of that user pays doctrine reached its high point with the Civil Aviation Authority in the 1990-92 period, when it was known under the notorious title of the affordable safety doctrine. This is detailed to some degree in chapter 3 of the commissioner's report, from page 90 onwards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The application of the cost recovery doctrine to aviation had its origins in an inquiry called the Bosch inquiry in the mid-1980s. The Bosch committee recommended that there were a lot of inefficiencies within the then Civil Aviation Authority and that they needed to be corrected first. When they were corrected, then it may be possible to go to 100 cost recovery from industry in a 10-year period. In actual fact, the CAA, with the support of the government, went to 108 per cent cost recovery inside a period of two <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> years, and quite radical changes were made in the authority. As I said at the time, the baby was thrown out with the bathwater. The regulatory authority ceased to have the authority that it needed, or ceased to exercise properly the authority needed, to regulate aviation within Australia safely for the travelling public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Civil Aviation Authority made another mistake in its quest for commercialism. There is nothing more bizarre than a Public Service body when it tries to enter the commercial world. They do not have the skills, the experience or the system of reward and censure that the commercial world applies to its operators in industry. They made a mistaken definition of who the customer was. They saw the customer of the regulatory authority as the aviation industry itself&mdash;the airlines and the operators of aircraft for hire and reward and other operators of aircraft. The consequence of seeing the airlines and the industry as the customers, rather than the general public, who are the real customers of the industry, led to a policy of appeasement with all the flaws that flow from a policy of appeasement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The flaws were manifested in the form of a degradation of surveillance on the industry. They invested this in the buzzwords of the time. They moved from what they called quality control&mdash;direct, hands-on surveillance of going around and inspecting companies, aircraft, aircrew and maintenance organisations and seeing for themselves what happened&mdash;which they said was now old fashioned, to what was called quality assurance, where they designated various people to discharge that responsibility subject to audit. In itself, that is not necessarily a bad thing, but it fell down because the Civil Aviation Authority failed to run adequate audit checks on the people that it gave delegated authority to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3840"> In the report of the commission there is a very appropriate quote from an in&hyphen;house journal of the Civil Aviation Authority at the time. One of the officers of the Civil Aviation Authority wrote in the journal that if Moses had believed in quality assurance rather than quality control he would not have come down from the mountain with the Ten Command ments; he would have come down with 10 guidelines. That is a rather tragically apt commentary on what happened here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report is absolute proof of the failure of the regulatory authority at the time and the operational doctrine that it followed. If this were all behind us, there would not be any point in my taking the time of the Senate tonight to talk about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been mixed up in the aviation industry for over 30 years as a pilot and for about 29 years as an aircraft owner. I have had an intimate involvement with the regulatory processes over a period of years from the time when it was the old Department of Civil Aviation through the move to the Department of Transport and back to the Civil Aviation Authority and now CASA. I have a very great fear that the situation today is no different from what it was two years ago when this dreadful and avoidable accident happened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot see any evidence at all that the quality of the regulatory authority has improved in any way at all. I do believe that the changing of the name of the authority has left the same practices in place. It is not the same people there. A lot of people carried on from the old CAA, but the same practices, the same mind&hyphen;set and the same ineffective surveillance are still there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is still a very great tendency to pick on the little rabbits of the industry, to pick on the people who do not fight back. Within my own personal experience, I have seen cases where people in the industry have been wrong, they have been quite culpable of breaching regulations, but they have fought back with ferocity and the regulatory authority has backed off. With a soft target, the authority will go in hard. They will take them to court and pursue that person relentlessly but, if someone fights back, the authority will not stand up and exercise its power responsibly and effectively. This report from the commissioner is testimony to that fact. I advise everyone to read it. It is a litany, an endless chain, of a lack of application of power at the correct time and in the correct way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, the board in pursuing rabbits really exercises power very, very <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> crudely. The ability to suspend licences of pilots summarily on the spot before any evidence is collected, and to do that with severe economic penalties on individuals who are operating in the industry, is without parallel in our society. No-one else can have their livelihood taken from them without due process being applied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come back to the point: I see no evidence at all that this authority has changed in any way at all. Its principal fault is a lack of professionalism in its ranks. The Senate has before it a bill to remodel the board of the Civil Aviation Authority. I think it is very important that that is done. While the members of the board at the present time are estimable people with worthy lives, ability and all the rest of it, very few of them have any knowledge of the industry at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a very complex industry. It does need people who have both an extensive exposure and knowledge of the industry and have been at it for a fair while. It does need as its chairman someone who is a professional airman or a professional aeronautical engineer. It is not a job for people who are motivated by good intentions or something like that. But, at the end of the day, the board really sets policy; it does not set the detail of what the regulatory authority does.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real problem with cleaning up the Civil Aviation Authority&mdash;or CASA, as it is now known&mdash;lies not with the Chief Executive Officer but that line of managers below the Chief Executive Officer who, in a general sense, are not capable of discharging the duties they are required to perform. There has to be a change there, otherwise the authority will not improve. Sure, we need to revise the regulations because in many ways our aviation industry here is very over&hyphen;regulated compared with other countries. Those regulations, when they are revised, need to be applied correctly, fearlessly and responsibly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to get people back into the Civil Aviation Authority, or the CASA, the way it was back in the days of the DCA, who know the industry intimately at all levels. We need to have a clear objective of not looking after the customer, but of looking after the public interest, the travelling public, the people who <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3841"> pay fares to be flown on either charter or regular public service flights. We need to look after those who send freight by aircraft and those who live under the flight paths of aircraft. That is the primary responsibility and it requires targeting and the setting of priorities with respect to surveillance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do believe we have to take the authority back in as a department of state. We as a parliament do need to be able to oversee it. I mention that because one of the former heads of the Civil Aviation Authority, Mr Baldwin, when all this nonsense was carried on in 1990&hyphen;92, absolutely refused to explain it to the parliament. He said he was the chief of a government business enterprise and he was not answerable to anyone in parliament. This is a matter that urgently needs addressing. The authority must be answerable to the parliament so that all of us can have oversight. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">With reference to an answer to a question without notice asked by Senator Margetts (Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> , 28 May 1996, p1182) relating to post&hyphen;consumer recycled paper which stated that `. . . purchasing policy for recycled paper products encourages buyers to purchase goods and services with the least harmful environmental effects. . .

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) Are the cost reductions to local government for waste disposal and establishing new tips and other costs related to disposal of waste paper included in the assessment.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator Short</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Administrative Services has provided the following answer to  the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) There is no specific policy in relation to recycled paper, however, the Government's policy on environmental purchasing is outlined in Request for Tender documents where appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Request for Tender documents issued by Purchasing Australia invite tenderers to indicate the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3844"> particular part of the production process, or characteristic of any of their offered products, that they claim is environmentally beneficial. Not only must tenderers substantiate their claims, they must also comply with the `Environmental Claims in Marketing&mdash;A Guideline' issued by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the Request for Tender document requires tenderers to disclose if ozone depleting or hazardous substances are contained in their products, or if ozone depleting substances are used in the production process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Buyers have this information available when making their purchasing decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)(a) The information in bids is used as part of the value for money evaluation of products offered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Elements used as criteria for tender evaluation are generally derived in consultation with buyers, suppliers and industry. The forthcoming tender for Tissue Paper Products will be including a weighting for recycled content.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) Any assessment of recycled paper does not distinguish between pre&hyphen;consumption and post&hyphen;consumption waste paper.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) Costs related to waste paper disposal are not taken into account in the assessment of tenders for the supply of paper products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) The removal of used paper from Commonwealth facilities is generally cost&hyphen;neutral and included as part of general waste removal contracts. Some Commonwealth agencies are, however, achieving a positive return with companies paying to remove used paper from their premises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) It is not possible to estimate how much the producers of post&hyphen;consumer recycled paper would be willing to pay to remove used paper from Commonwealth facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(8) Savings to the Commonwealth by having the makers of post&hyphen;consumer recycled paper products remove the Commonwealth's waste paper could only be tested by going to the market. It is therefore not possible to estimate the savings without running a tender process. It should be noted that many agencies already have arrangements in place whereby companies remove waste paper separately from general waste so as to facilitate recycling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(9) The Government is encouraging paper recycling by pursuing new industry waste reduction agreements with the paper industry.</PARA>
