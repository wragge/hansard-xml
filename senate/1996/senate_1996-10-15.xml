<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Last Thursday, 10 October, I made a brief statement to the Senate in respect of certain shares I held jointly with my wife in several Australian public companies. I must now inform the Senate that I have inadvertently misled the chamber. In response to Senator Sherry's motion concerning potential conflicts of interest I stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I can assure the Senate that I have had no conflict of interest during the last six months, nor do I expect one to occur.</PARA>
<PARA>At the time I made this statement I believed it to be true. However, since Thursday my staff and the Department of the Treasury have been double&hyphen;checking all the administrative matters that have been processed through my office in the past seven months. As you would appreciate, Madam President, there has been a very large number of matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday, my staff discovered a minor administrative action that I processed in late June, which I must now bring to the attention of the Senate. I would like to take a moment to explain what the matter was.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Securities Commission had received an application from a company, Boral Energy (Vic) Pty Ltd, seeking a declaration that it could be included in the Victorian electricity exempt futures market which had been created by the former Attorney&hyphen;General, Michael Lavarch, in May last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An exempt futures market status is intended for specialist futures markets which are for professional, specialist investors only. Applications to the Australian Securities Commission are assessed against criteria set out in its policy statement No. 70. As I said, the Victorian electricity exempt futures market was created in May 1995 when 12 electricity companies were declared exempt by the then Attorney&hyphen;General. On 27 September last year, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> two more participants were included in that list.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a memorandum dated 25 June this year, Treasury recommended that I approve a recommendation from the ASC that Boral Energy (Vic) Pty Ltd be declared exempt; that is, that the company be allowed to participate in the Victorian electricity exempt futures market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The futures market is about participants hedging their risks. All participants in this exempt market are professional energy companies. The Victorian market is a precursor to the establishment of a national electricity market, which is expected to become operative next year. I accepted the Treasury's and the ASC's advice and signed the declaration on behalf of the Treasurer (Mr Costello).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Senate is aware, in June this year I held shares in Boral Ltd. The particular company, Boral Energy (Vic) Pty Ltd, is a related company to Boral. Six months earlier, my wife and I sold a significant volume of shares we held, including a number of Boral shares, for the purpose of financing an investment property. The details of those sales were included in my notification to the Registrar of Senators' Interests on 19 January this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, when the memorandum was placed in front of me for consideration, my memory was that my wife and I had sold all our Boral shares; and I acted on that basis. I was wrong to do so. I should not have signed the declaration and I should have passed it to the Treasurer for action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is of little comfort to say that I regret my action. My failure to act on this matter, in accordance with accepted procedure, was not a deliberate attempt to advance my private interests. Indeed, there can be no question of putting private interests before public duty as, in this case, my duty was to grant Boral Energy the relevant declaration. By doing so, competition in the market for electricity was increased. The decision was one recommended to me by both the market regulator, the ASC, and the policy department, the Treasury. I accepted that advice and acted accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nevertheless, I consider integrity to be of the utmost importance and the course of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> action I should follow has been quite clear. While there was no intended impropriety on my part, it is clear to me that these circumstances could be perceived to constitute a conflict of interest and my failure to act accordingly necessitates the action I have taken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My error was found only yesterday and I notified the Treasurer immediately. Further checks were undertaken to confirm my mistake. Once those processes had been properly completed, I took the only honourable action possible. I now wish to inform the Senate that, with the greatest regret, yesterday evening I tendered to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) my resignation as Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer. This morning, the Prime Minister informed me that he had accepted my resignation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam President, I have always declared my private interests to the Senate. Unlike many other employees, my superannuation from past employment was largely in shares. These shares were held jointly with my wife and were purchased long before I came to this place. They were always intended to provide income for us during retirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While my circumstances will be judged by others in the days ahead, and I stand ready to accept the inevitable criticism of my actions that will undoubtedly follow, I would hope that my example will demonstrate the need in Australia for the establishment of a system of blind trusts to support executive officers of government, statutory officer holders, members of the judiciary and others. A blind trust places an individual's assets at arm's length while they hold public office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to take the opportunity to thank the people who have helped me in the last seven months. I thank my staff, the departmental people from the business law division of Treasury, who have been excellent to me, and the ASC and its commissioners. I particularly thank the Treasurer and the Prime Minister for their assistance and help. Australia is in good hands. I commend their actions. I commend them for their assistance and their trust in me for the past seven months. I inadvertently misled the Senate and I extend my unreserved apologies to senators.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. Given that the Prime Minister yesterday affirmed that it was not acceptable to delay the disposal of ministerial shareholdings on the basis of convenience or profit, has the Prime Minister directed the industry minister, Mr Moore, to immediately dispose of his shares in Bligh Ventures? Can the minister guarantee that the industry minister, Mr Moore, has taken no ministerial decision that directly or inadvertently impacts on the prospects of Bligh Ventures?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no question of maximising personal profit out of these shareholdings, which in this case the honourable minister held before taking office. The question that he has to direct himself to is whether these are shares or similar interests in a company or business involved in the area of his portfolio responsibilities. I understand this company, Bligh Ventures&mdash;although it is spoken of as a venture company, it is really an investment company&mdash;has no direct contact with government and certainly has not had direct contact with Minister Moore in his capacity as a minister.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. The opposition has repeatedly criticised the government's decision to appoint a special auditor. This morning, the shadow minister, Daryl Melham, was on ABC radio claiming that the appointment of the special auditor was nothing more than a political stunt. Could the minister explain to the Senate the value of the special auditor process and what it says about Labor's scandalous mismanagement of this important area of accountability?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Troeth for that important question.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This special auditor's report gives ATSIC a huge tick, a huge clearance. There is no evidence of corruption. The only evidence of breaches are technical breaches, which are failing to lodge reports or failing to respond to letters.</PARA>
<PARA>It seems the opposition have learnt nothing in their seven months in opposition. They are still completely out of touch; they still cannot understand. The chair of ATSIC, Ms Lois O'Donoghue, whom I have mentioned I have a very high regard for, has acknowledged the value of the special auditor process. In a statement she released yesterday she said:</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VW4">Senator HERRON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just wait and hear the rest of the answer. Those opposite have the hide to argue that the special auditor process was not necessary and did not achieve anything. Senator Troeth, let us look at what the special auditor found. Nineteen per cent of all organisations funded by ATSIC were in serious breach of grant conditions. Sixty organisations which received $27.8 million in their last ATSIC grant should be declared not fit and proper and defunded&mdash;and that was in your time. Mr Melham said it was a huge tick, a huge clearance of $27.8 million. Tell that to the battlers in Banks&mdash;that $27.8 million is a huge tick. I am pleased that he is not in control of the banks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> At the time of the court decision, the special auditor was seeking additional information on a further 130 organisations that received $89.6 million in their latest funding. Of these organisations the special auditor says, `There is the potential for some or all to be declared not fit and proper.' The special auditor has found a further 184 organisations were in such serious breach of grant condi tions that they require immediate and close attention. They received a total of $124 million in their latest funding. You say that is a total clearance. That is a total of 374 of the 1,300 organisations funded by ATSIC that are either in serious breach of grant conditions, not fit and proper, or requiring immediate and close attention. Those 374 organisations received a total of $241 million in their latest ATSIC grants.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You should encourage me to, because it has proven you totally wrong and totally out of touch. We are talking about $241 million of taxpayers' money that was granted to these organisations under your government, under a Labor government. These are organisations that were either in serious breach, not fit and proper, or requiring immediate and close attention. That is acceptable to those opposite. They claim there were no problems. As far as they are concerned, the special auditor did not find anything worth while. According to their spokesman it was all a political stunt; it amounted to a big tick. Perhaps that explains why they are in such a mess, and why we were in such a mess in this country and why they were thrown out of office, because they were there for 13 years, and why they are destined to stay out of office for the next 13 years.</PARA></TALK.START></ANSWER>

World Rural Women's Day recognises rural women, including those who are small farmers and entrepreneurs, who manage much of our natural resources, create jobs across the whole economy, produce most of our food and care for the next generation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This parliament is the venue for the meeting today of 14 eminent rural women. They will convey to the government first hand their view on the role of women in the future of Australia's rural sector. The government's commitment is reflected in the decision by the Prime Minister, John Howard, to join today's program, including what I am sure will be a frank and open round table discussion on how we can better achieve our mutual policy goals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The level of international support and interest is perhaps no better shown than through a message received overnight from Hillary Clinton which reads in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As we celebrate World Rural Women's Day, we are going to have the opportunity to recognise the important contributions of farm women everywhere. Producing more than three-quarters of the world's food, rural women play such an important role in sustaining and preserving their families, communities and ultimately their nation. Thank you again for your work on behalf of Australia's farm women and women everywhere.</PARA>

This includes exposure to mobile phones, mobile phone towers and broadcast towers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The program will consist of a public information dissemination strategy, continuing participation in the World Health Organisation's project to assess the health and environmental effects of EME exposure, and an <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> independent Australian research program. The government will allocate $4.5 million over five years to fund this program. The cost of the program will be fully offset by a small increase in radiocommunications licence fees to commence in November 1996. The government has been developing this radiofrequency electromagnetic energy program for some months. We have taken into account community representations and the results of an independent community awareness survey, which was conducted by AGB McNair on the basis of a consultancy awarded by the Department of Communications and the Arts on 19 July last. We have also taken account of the recommendations of the Senate majority report on the proposed sale of part of Telstra, together with international developments and other pertinent issues.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Implicit in the question is a presumption of guilt. The very purpose of having an inquiry is to ascertain whether there are any grounds for additional concerns. The fact is that there is no evidence to date to suggest that people are at risk. There are standards with which we comply very significantly. In other words, we act conservatively by international standards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4150"> The proposition that somehow you ought to suddenly assume that there is a radiation danger and that people are suffering ahead of the inquiry seems to me to be absolute non sense. There is a national code designed to regulate the location of mobile phone towers and other transmission facilities. They take account of existing health concerns. But, at the end of day, the purpose of the inquiry is to allay, as much as possible, the concerns that you and others have been implying but not providing any evidence to support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of the inquiry is to assure the public that, as much as possible, we can have an independent assessment of the level of electromagnetic energy emitted by radio frequency transmissions so that they can have confidence in a scientific assessment rather than having to respond to those who might be out there wanting to simply presume the worst and create fears and concerns that are not substantiated by evidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is from an abundance of caution that we have taken this action. We think it will go a long way towards alleviating a lot of community concern, which we believe is unnecessary, on the current state of the evidence. To the extent that there are continuing changes in technology and continuing developments in scientific research, we think it is prudent to ensure that those matters are taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an international issue. The World Health Organisation has been pursuing it for a long time. We are involved directly in those issues. I think we have an interdepartmental committee that has been examining the issues for some months. It is arising out of their recommendations that we commissioned that research back in July of this year. In other words, the government has been well and truly aware that there are people who will continue to suggest that there might be problems even though there is no evidence to support that. On that basis, we thought it was about time that we ensured that a scientific assessment was made that was independent of the players who might be involved in the construction of towers and other facilities. This will ensure that people have the maximum degree of confidence.</PARA></ANSWER>

You are asking whether we are prepared to award compensation to those people who are adversely affected before there is any evidence to suggest that anyone has been adversely affected. It really is quite irresponsible of you to run around and talk in those terms. The precautionary principle that you refer to is the one that we are adopting, otherwise we would simply sit back and wait until there was evidence that might justify your concerns. There is none on the horizon to my knowledge. The World Health Organisation has not come up with anything to date.</PARA></TALK.START>

You cannot do much more than that in terms of precautionary action. To go beyond that and talk about giving guarantees and being prepared to pay compensation ahead of the verdict simply means that you are not really interested in having an open mind on the issue.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Abetz for his question. Mr Free's actions are yet another example of the people bashing or the granny bashing&mdash;whatever you like to call it&mdash;that the Labor Party has engaged in. Yesterday we saw Senator Neal's little effort in the seat of Robertson. Today we are seeing what the Labor candidate in the electorate of Lindsay is doing to try to win back the seat the people chucked him out of just seven months ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is all Mr Free's letter is&mdash;a cheap political trick. It is dishonest, it is cruel and it is scaremongering. Mr Free knows better because he was a minister in the last government, and that last government made certain commitments to the people of Australia about public housing reform which we endorsed in opposition. We gave bipartisan support to those commitments and, since coming into government, we have endorsed them again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those commitments are that existing public housing tenants will not be disadvantaged by the reforms, that new public housing tenants will not need to pay more than 25 per cent of their income in rent and that the reform <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> process will not result in savings for either the Commonwealth or the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, the Labor candidate&mdash;who is trying to win back the seat he was chucked out of in March&mdash;was a minister in the Labor government that gave those commitments which we endorsed then and have endorsed since. I am shocked that this candidate would be sending out letters to public housing tenants telling them that they are going to suffer some enormous indignity as a result of the changes that we are going to implement in accordance with his own state government in New South Wales and with the other states and territories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trouble is that the people of Australia have come to expect the worst from the ALP, and the ALP can be relied upon to produce the worst. They simply turn up these scare tactics whenever they are in a corner. My office has received numerous calls from people, and what particularly worries me is the elderly people, who have been frightened by this scare campaign. It is malicious and it is cruel and, as I said before, it is shameful. It is typical of the Labor Party's way of doing business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was in the electorate of Lindsay on Friday and I went around with our candidate, Miss Jackie Kelly, who was elected by the people of Lindsay. Senator Alston was there, too. I found out that Miss Kelly also has been inundated with calls from people who are frightened by this awful campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are we going to do about it? There is something we can do about it. How did the Labor candidate gain access to the private records of public housing tenants in New South Wales? How did the Labor Party find out about that? I would like to know from the candidate himself and from the Minister for Housing in New South Wales. Has there been any irregularity? If there has been any impropriety, I imagine the Independent Commission Against Corruption will be asked to investigate the matter.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Madam President. I have moved the motion in the terms that I have outlined to the Senate. What we have had demonstrated over the past two weeks of the parliamentary sittings is that the Prime Minister's code of ministerial conduct is in tatters. The Prime Minister of this country gave a solemn pledge to greater integrity in government, to higher standards of ministerial conduct, to the highest moral standards possible. That was Mr Howard's pledge before he was elected. Already one minister and one parliamentary secretary have resigned, and other ministers of this government are unable, or unwilling, to answer questions about their own ministerial conflict of interest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Howard is the Prime Minister who has pontificated like no other Prime Minister in Australian political history about his written code. There has never been a Prime Minister who has waxed so lyrical about his ministerial standards and his ministerial code. He has now admitted that his code is no more than a consolidation of the standards that applied under Labor. What we have is a prime ministerial code of conduct that has been exposed as a sham, as meaningless and as a hoax. It has been exposed as a fraud both on the parliament and on the Australian people. It was nothing more than another electoral bribe from Mr Howard; it was nothing more than another non&hyphen;core promise from the coalition government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Look at the record; look at the facts; look at what this government has delivered in relation to ministerial propriety and the prime ministerial code. Senator Short would still be Assistant Treasurer of Australia if he had not been exposed by the Labor opposition in this chamber. He would still be the Assistant Treasurer and he would still be sitting on his ANZ shares; he would still be undertaking activities in the conduct of his ministerial <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4154"> duty that could be or were directly exposed as a conflict of interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had Senator Short defending in this chamber his conflict of interest and defending the fact that he held shares. We had Mr Howard, and Senator Hill in this chamber, not accepting that Senator Short was in breach of Mr Howard's prime ministerial code. It was Senator Short who self&hyphen;immolated after being exposed by Senator Sherry's notice of motion and forced by the Labor opposition in this chamber to make an explanation of his behaviour. It was the Labor Party and the media that brought Senator Short undone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we had Senator Gibson. The situation with Senator Gibson is no different. The only difference you can ascertain is that at least Senator Short did try in this chamber to justify his actions. When I moved a motion yesterday, when I indicated that we would give Senator Gibson leave before the Senate to explain his actions before the Senate, he squibbed it. It was the most pea hearted and cowardly performance that we have seen from an office holder of the federal government, probably in the history of this place. He absolutely squibbed it. His behaviour was no different from Senator Short's and, finally, reluctantly, he has been dragged kicking and screaming to the ministerial and parliamentary secretarial cemetery, along with Senator Short.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now we have Mr Moore openly defying Mr Howard. Even on the record in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> newspaper he has been openly defying. He had been told by the Prime Minister to divest himself of his shares by 27 May. He has done nothing about it and Mr Howard has not forced him to do anything about it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was much said about the gains that were made so I took the liberty of writing down Senator Short's portfolio and compared the statistics of 5 March 1996&mdash;in the first <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> after the election&mdash;with those of 10 October 1996 when this matter was raised. At the top, ANZ shares are listed. I believe he had something like 6,360 shares. On 5 March 1996 they were worth $6.54 and on 10 October 1996 they were worth $7.28; in other words, they had risen by 74c a share. But now let us look at the rest of Senator Short's portfolio and see where those gains were. The next on the list is BHP. On 5 March 1996 those shares were worth $19.23 and on 10 October they were worth $16.12, a drop of $3.11 each&mdash;and where did anyone over that side, right down to the Democrats, mention that loss that Senator Short had of $3.11 per share? Did anyone mention that&mdash;Senator Sherry, Senator Schacht, Senator Cook or Senator Faulkner? No, they did not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us go down the list. Next is CRA. On 5 March it was worth exactly $20 a share. On 10 October it was worth $18.85; that is,&mdash;$1.15. Who on the other side mentioned these ill&hyphen;gotten gains? The next is CSR. It was worth $4.65 on 5 March 1996 and $4.41 on 10 October. That was&mdash;24c. Did anyone mention that? No, they only mentioned the ANZ that went the other way. Let us go down one more. Boral has been mentioned in this Senate today. On 5 March 1996 those shares were worth $3.66 and on 10 October they were worth $3.30, which is&mdash;36c per share. Were they mentioned? No, the only ones mentioned were the ANZ ones that happened to go the other way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I go down this list far enough, I might find one where there has been a gain. But I have read out a list that shows that there were far more losses than gains for Senator Short. So where are the ill&hyphen;gotten gains? They were not ill&hyphen;gotten and, moreover, there were no gains.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4155"> I have been going through the register of shares of those opposite. Why is that side&mdash;Labor, Greens and Democrats&mdash;shy of invest ing in Australia? I have gone through almost all of the senators' interests register and you can hardly find a share over there. There is a spare one over there that Senator Minchin might sell off. He has a share to sell that you can probably buy off market for some sort of price and between you, you might be able to say that you have invested in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Greens have jumped on the bandwagon too. Yesterday I got a call from the media asking me, `Do you hold Wesfarmers shares?' `Yes.' `Do you intend to take part in the debate?' `No.' `Do you intend to vote in the debate?' `Yes.' `Do you intend to declare your shares?' `Yes.' And then they said, `How many have you got?' And my answer of course was, `None of your business.' That is how the Greens tried to jump on the bandwagon, as they always do at the last moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I get back to where I started: where are Jim Short's gains? From what I have read out from his portfolio, ANZ is the only one where he has made a gain. So how can they have the hide to say that he had ill&hyphen;gotten gains. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Reflecting on Senator Panizza's contribution a couple of days ago in defence of Senator Short, how a few days in politics makes a big difference! Last Thursday morning when the notice of motion was debated I highlighted that Senator Short was the Assistant Treasurer and Senator Gibson was the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Costello), the economic minister and assistant minister, respectively, in the Senate responsible for economic matters, dealing with legislation and a range of specific portfolio duties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, I do not think Senator Panizza has been listening to the debate and the questions over the last four or five days because the central issue here, as was highlighted last Thursday morning in the notice of motion that was subsequently passed, is the shares held by Senator Short and those held by Senator Gibson and the potential for conflict. We argue that in a number of areas actual conflict occurs between those shareholders and their responsibilities.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of Senator Short, Senator Panizza, it occurs with respect to administration of banking laws and insurance and superannuation matters as they related to the ANZ shares that he held. It may well be that the ANZ shares are the only shares to have gone up in value. I suspect that is the case, but I understand that one of the themes from your side of politics is that the share market has been booming since the election and you have all done very well. That is one of the themes you have been advancing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not the central issue; the central issue is the conflict of interest, the failure of a minister and now a parliamentary secretary to adhere to the guidelines laid down by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard)&mdash;not just laid down by the Prime Minister but debated in this chamber on a number of occasions in respect to Senator Herron and Mr Anderson. Senator Short and Senator Gibson found themselves&mdash;because of their shareholdings&mdash;in direct conflict with decisions they had made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of both Senator Short and Senator Gibson I have made the point that it is very difficult for a minister or parliament secretary, particularly in the economic portfolio area, to directly own any form of shares. Certainly, the conflict of interest was highlighted with the ANZ Bank. We have not yet had an explanation from Senator Gibson as to why he has decided to sell his shares in the Bank of Melbourne and the NAB and whether or not any decisions were taken that conflicted with his responsibilities in relation to cheques and bills of exchange.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What Senator Gibson's resignation highlights today in the Senate is the conflict that occurred in respect to another shareholding, Boral, and the decision he took in respect to, he says, a minor administrative matter in his capacity in dealing with companies and securities. This highlights the difficulty that economic ministers and parliamentary secretaries have in directly holding shares and the conflict of interest that can occur. That is the central point in this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had the two principal economic representatives of the government in the Senate resign in two days over these issues. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4156"> The issue is not how many shares they own, what they are worth or whether we have shares over this side but the clear guidelines that were laid down by the Prime Minister. He set the benchmark. He set the bar that Senator Short and Senator Gibson have now tripped over&mdash;at waist height. Now Mr Howard apparently wants to revisit these guidelines, according to information from the party room this morning. He should have thought about this issue when the guidelines were laid down.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Collins, you could tell from question time that Senator Kernot had had a briefing from you or from Senator Ray. The Labor Party has shown absolute hypocrisy when talking about propriety of ministers and propriety of members of parliament. You only have to look at the actions or the inactions of the Labor government in this regard to understand my sadness at the abject hypocrisy of the Labor Party and the Democrats.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is it not true&mdash;hopefully someone might prove me wrong&mdash;that Mr Keating borrowed money from the Commonwealth Bank when he was the Treasurer? Was that true? As Treasurer, he held all of the shares in the Commonwealth Bank and borrowed money from it to invest in a piggery venture. There is one thing in Mr Keating's favour: he did invest in Australia. Admittedly, it was a pretty shonky investment, but he borrowed money from the Commonwealth Bank when he held all the shares in it and invested in a piggery that went wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most of the Labor Party people&mdash;if you could be bothered to look at their statements of interest&mdash;have not invested in Australia at all. That is the sort of people they are. They come out of the union movement and the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ALP not interested in Australia and not interested in investing in Australia. As Senator Parer said earlier, this is getting down to the ridiculous stage regarding insurance policies or superannuation policies and the companies that run those insurance policies and superannuation policies and which invest in shares. Every decision that this government makes is relevant to the price of those shares.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been pointed out, quite properly, that in this parliament those in the opposition and the Democrats, if they get together, as they usually do, can affect what happens in the share market or in the financial markets by rejecting legislation or by approving legislation. So all of the people on the other side, even though they are not now on the front bench of government, have an impact on the way the markets operate. So perhaps we should be a little more circumspect about just what the Labor Party people now have. We know that when they were in government they were not very keen on disclosing too much at all. I return again to Mr Keating. A lot of the things that transpired as to what he eventually did were not even mentioned in the register tabled in the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Keating was the man who, as Treasurer of this nation, who at a time when the tax office which he administered was suing ordinary battling Australians and battling small businessmen for failing to put in their tax returns on time, for two years in a row failed to put in his tax return. This was at a time when he was administering the tax acts and the taxation office. Why did he not resign? Because that is the standard the Labor Party brings into public office. Did Senator Evans or his children buy shares in the Commonwealth Bank float? Tell me about Mrs Lawrence. Isn't Mrs Lawrence the lady who was proved to have lied, yet the Labor Party did absolutely nothing about that at the time? Not only did they leave her there at the time; she is still there on the front bench under this weak person who currently masquerades as your leader.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish Senator Ray would come down and take charge of this opposition. In response to an interjection asking why he does not come down and take over the leadership, Senator <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4157"> Ray said, `Don't tempt me.'

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This mess is entirely the making of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). This matter was first raised in the Senate on 6 May this year in regard to Minister Herron's desire to be a part-time minister for Aboriginal affairs and, in his own words, `a weekend hobby surgeon'. Senator Herron revealed for the first time in response to a question from me concerning that double role that a deadline had been set for 27 May to comply with the code which had been tabled in parliament with great fanfare by the Prime Minister in the House of Representatives and by his representative Senator Hill in the Senate on the first day of sitting, 30 April. Much was made of the code.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Herron said that it was a matter for the Prime Minister to decide and he had made an appointment to see him. He said, `The Prime Minister is the boss and I will accept his decision.' When the same matter was raised by Mr Beazley the following day in the House, the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is true that the ministerial guide, as tabled, requires statements of pecuniary interest to be made to me by 27 May. I expect that there will be 100 per cent compliance with that request, that I will have the statements of pecuniary interest by 27 May.</PARA>
<PARA>Later in the same response the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The guidelines that were laid down in this document will be complied with in full.</PARA>
<PARA>The clear implication from the Prime Minister was that he would ensure compliance with his code. He informed the House that he had told the minister for Aboriginal affairs that he would not be allowed to continue as a weekend hobby surgeon and would be a full-time minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the question was later raised about a potential conflict of interest with the minister for primary industries, Mr Anderson, and the diesel fuel rebate, the minister representing <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> him, Senator Parer, told the Senate that any possible conflict of interest in this area was a matter between Mr Anderson, the Prime Minister and cabinet. Senator Herron and Senator Parer were both clearly aware that these were the Prime Minister's guidelines and the Prime Minister would be responsible for enforcing them. After all, why would you require ministers to report to you by May 27 if you had no intention of ensuring that those rules had been complied with?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, there were then no further checks made by the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is now attempting to turn attention away from himself and his ministers are now falling at the rate of knots. In answer to Mr Beazley's first question last week, 10 October, the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The nature of the ministerial guide&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and these words are interesting in terms of what has happened today&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">which I stand by, puts an onus on ministers to comply with it.</PARA>
<PARA>As we now know, last week the Prime Minister was standing by this guide. Today he is running away from it officially at a rate of knots. The member for Dobell (Mr Lee) interjected and asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What about you? What is the obligation on you?</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I repeat that the ministerial guide places an obligation on ministers to comply.</PARA>
<PARA>What happened to the leader who was telling parliament in May that the guidelines would be fully complied with? What happened to the Prime Minister who last week said he stood by these guidelines but today has revealed that he is running away from two dead bodies on his front bench at 100 miles an hour?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister, in fact, was given more than three weeks clear notice before 27 May that the opposition would be pursuing this matter to ensure there was full compliance with his much vaunted guidelines. Clearly, given Senator Short's present circumstances, he failed to consult with any of them to ensure that, come 28 May, they were in compliance with what he is now describing as a guide on ministerial accountability and what <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4158"> he has now announced he is going to redraft. So much for `honest John'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister, in fact, has been tiptoeing through a minefield that he himself planted. He is the one who should be held directly responsible for this mess. He tabled the code in parliament; he boasted about it; he was given three weeks warning in May that it was going to be an issue that would be pursued; he said there would be full compliance. Six months later a number of ministers and parliamentary secretaries&mdash;still today, as we speak&mdash;do not comply with the code.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What we are really debating here today is a question of standards. I would hesitate to say that if both Senator Gibson and Senator Short had been members of a Labor government they would still be ministers. It was never the habit of any Labor government minister to resign for any reason whatsoever until eventually they were pressured into it after weeks of denying. Take Ros Kelly, for example, when she was minister for the environment. How long did it take Ros Kelly to admit that she had rorted the system and resign? It took months and months of questioning, denying and being protected by the then Prime Minister. Eventually the weight of public pressure was so strong that we saw the demise of Ros Kelly.</PARA></TALK.START>

It took months and months of pressure until eventually the pressure became too great and they had to resign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say that there are two different standards. When Senator Short and Senator Gibson, both men of the highest integrity, realised an error had been made, they announced their resignations. Within a couple of days they voluntarily resigned. That is the difference between the standards that were set by the previous government and the standard of these two gentlemen who, let me say, I regard as people of the highest integrity. Certainly, Senator Short, as Assistant Treasurer, and Senator Gibson, as Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, put in hours of diligent work in areas in which they had some expertise.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased to table this report of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee on the abolition of the development import finance facility, or DIFF scheme. DIFF was introduced into the Australian aid program by the Fraser coalition government in 1982. It combined grant funds and export credits to provide concessional loans for developing countries to finance high priority public sector development projects. The present government decided on 8 May this year to terminate the scheme from 1 July.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of continuing refinements to the scheme within Australia and stricter OECD guidelines for mixed credits, DIFF in 1996 bore little resemblance to the original scheme. DIFF was a development scheme with broad humanitarian objectives. By any definition, the overwhelming majority of DIFF projects <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> approved since the inception of the OECD's 1992 Helsinki rules could be classed as humanitarian aid. Many projects had a significant impact at local community level: for example, in education, renewable energy and environmental areas. It was, in fact, a very successful scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An important secondary benefit of DIFF was that it enabled Australian companies to compete on an equal footing with foreign companies when vying for development projects. DIFF was not a subsidy to Australian business but extended to recipient countries terms which enabled them to consider Australian bids for development projects. Recently about 85 per cent of projects funded under the scheme were nominated by recipient countries and not by commercial interests. Projects reflected primarily the development priorities of those countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the Australian government terminated DIFF, it decided not to proceed any further with 50 projects which had received a letter of advice but had not received a letter of formal offer. These projects had received formal notification from AusAID that they were of sufficient priority and met the general eligibility requirements but had still to pass certain formal appraisal processes. The overwhelming evidence presented to the committee suggested that companies and recipient governments regarded the letter of advice as indicating that, subject to a satisfactory completion of those appraisal processes, DIFF funding would be forthcoming. AusAID has assured the committee that, as DIFF operated, 70 per cent of projects with a letter of advice proceeded to completion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee believes that the decision not to proceed with these projects represents the narrowest possible legalistic approach to the termination of DIFF. It took no account of Asian business culture based upon development of relationships, trust and commitments. It ignored the pleas of senior ministers of recipient countries not to scrap particular projects. It took no account of considerable investments made by recipient countries, sometimes at the direct request of the Australian government. And it dealt a serious blow <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4166"> to relations, particularly commercial relations, between Australia and regional countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The termination of DIFF has had an adverse impact not only on the communities affected but also on Australia's standing as a provider of humanitarian relief to developing countries. The committee noted that the government has acknowledged the continuing need for concessional finance to support the massive infrastructure needs of developing countries in the region, citing a figure of $US1.5 trillion for infrastructure needs in South&hyphen;East and East Asia in the next decade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the next five years alone developing countries in the region will require $US8.5 billion for pollution and emission controls and $US7 billion for water and sanitation each year. These are the very areas on which DIFF projects were concentrating. The committee finds the government's decision to terminate not only the DIFF scheme itself but also specific projects in the pipeline to be inexplicable and inconsistent with its own rhetoric.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decision has had a severe impact on many Australian companies, which have lost projects worth $1.3 billion. The short&hyphen;sighted nature of the decision to terminate DIFF can be seen in the fact that one New South Wales company alone will lose $110 million of export earnings in order to help the government save $70 million this year by terminating DIFF. The government has created an export `black hole'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although a few big name players appear on the list of Australian companies involved in DIFF, most companies involved were small to medium sized enterprises&mdash;many of these subcontracted to 50 or more other companies. They will now no longer be able to employ additional staff as anticipated. Some will have to lay off staff. Many companies had invested large sums in particular projects, and considerable time and resources. These investments have now been lost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Vying for a DIFF contract entailed commercial risk. There was often strong competition from other Australian and overseas companies. Companies also had to meet all AusAID's DIFF requirements and to subject their proposals to OECD scrutiny. These risks were accepted as normal commercial risks. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> What cannot be construed in any possible way as commercial risk was the government's arbitrary decision to terminate DIFF. DIFF was the basis on which all of the projects were negotiated and implemented. Without DIFF, Australian companies could not even get to the negotiating table.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">DIFF enabled Australian companies to win follow&hyphen;on business in important developing markets. Even discounting the automatic multiplier provided by the combination of grant and loan funds in DIFF projects, the accepted figure was $2.30 of further business for Australian companies generated by every dollar of DIFF funding. In many cases DIFF was instrumental in establishing a market presence and earning credibility for a company which was then able to win further, fully commercial contracts. These opportunities will now be lost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For a government which trumpets its concern for small business, which assures us of its interest in engaging with Asia and which makes much of its desire to increase employment, the decision is monumentally ill&hyphen;judged. The committee therefore recommends that all projects holding letters of advice should be processed in the normal way and that funds be made available to AusAID to finance projects which successfully pass the appraisal processes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has indicated that it will consider introducing a revised mixed credits scheme as early as 1997&hyphen;98. It is included in the terms of reference of the Simons review of Australia's aid program. The committee believes that a revised scheme as outlined in the department of foreign affairs and AusAID submission largely describes DIFF, either as it was or at least as it was evolving.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government were to suspend DIFF for only one year, it is incomprehensible why the government did not simply revise it instead of going through the trauma of terminating it and then replacing it with a similar scheme, incurring substantial damage to the national interest in the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee believes that DIFF was an effective element in Australia's overall aid program. It also provided significant benefits for Australian companies, particularly in the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4167"> sector providing high technology capital goods, arguably the most important sector for Australia's future trade performance. The committee therefore recommends that the Australian government not wait for the financial year 1997&hyphen;98 but introduce, at the earliest possible time, another mixed credits scheme to replace DIFF. The committee also recommends that, given the significant environmental needs in the region&mdash;acknowledged by the government&mdash;the percentage of projects under the green DIFF component in any new mixed credit scheme be raised to 40 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many witnesses who appeared before the committee spoke of the importance of personal relationships and trust established over a long period of time in business dealings in Asian countries, and of the enormous damage done to commercial relationships by the decision to terminate DIFF. The withdrawal of Australian government support for these projects is regarded as a serious breach of faith on the part of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At first, Mr Downer tried to play down the strength of the criticisms of regional countries. In answer to a question without notice on 18 June in the House of Representatives, he replied that `not one minister' has raised concerns with him. One by one, the written and oral criticisms of ministers of regional countries were made public. The minister was forced to apologise for misleading Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The strength of the adverse reaction in the region to the original decision to terminate DIFF is evident in the minister's decision on 22 July to provide funding for some high priority projects nominated by recipient governments. The committee believes that this embarrassing partial policy reversal only serves to emphasise the precipitate and ill&hyphen;considered nature of the original decision. Moreover, this about&hyphen;turn has also heightened the confusion in the region about Australia's intentions and can only further erode Australia's credibility as a reliable aid provider and neighbour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During examination of these matters in the public hearings, the committee sought certain documents and information which officers of the department and AusAID referred to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer). <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> The minister has refused to provide those documents or information to the committee on grounds that the committee found to be quite unconvincing. The effect of that refusal has been that the committee is unable to conclude its inquiries under terms of references (d) and (f).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Until that information requested by the committee is provided by the government, the committee can only report in interim terms in relation to those two terms of reference. The committee believes that it is in the public interest for the requested information and documents to be made available to the committee. The committee believes that the minister's reasons for withholding the documents and information from the committee are specious, and therefore recommends to the Senate that the documents be provided to the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee also believes that the many issues left unanswered could be resolved if the minister were to agree to the committee's request to appear before the committee. I indicate that tomorrow I will give notice of motion with respect to the production of documents and other matters raised in the committee's recommendations on these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, the committee found that DIFF was an important and effective element in Australia's aid program, which delivered significant humanitarian benefits to developing countries. It also assisted Australian companies by enabling them to compete on equal terms with overseas companies for development projects. Its abrupt termination has damaged our relationships with regional countries, undermined Australia's standing as a provider of humanitarian relief and compromised our commercial credibility in the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4168"> Recipient governments will view with caution future commitments made by Australian governments. Australian companies will find it significantly more difficult to establish themselves and win contracts in the region. The implementation of the decision to terminate the scheme was clumsy and ill&hyphen;judged and has only confirmed the perception in some quarters that the government's commit ment to Asia is little more than lip service. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This report of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References committee on the abolition of the development import finance facility being tabled today comes in two parts: a majority report from the majority of Labor members on the committee and a minority report from the three coalition members. A minority report was considered necessary because the Labor members from the very beginning treated this inquiry as a political exercise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now this political emphasis is highlighted by their conclusion that they can only report in interim terms on two terms of reference. That is a ludicrous suggestion when the totality of evidence given in the inquiry is considered. This included direct responses from foreign governments and their ambassadors, including a press release dated 15 September from President Ramos of the Philippines issued `to rectify inaccurate newspaper responses', denying the decision to terminate DIFF had damaged relations between Australia and the Philippines, and pointing out `negotiations on funding mixed credit projects were going on between the National Economic and Development Authority and Australian aid officials'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The allegations by Labor members of the committee that specific possible parliamentary question briefs, government to government correspondence and cables be revealed to the committee show that they have forgotten in a very short space of time the proper requirements of government. The opposition, only recently out of government, is now trying to tell the Senate that they do not understand that PPQs and government to government correspondence are the subject of confidentiality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The government acted in a proper manner in claiming that non-disclosure of such correspondence and information is in the national interest. The opposition members cried about the effects on foreign governments yet at the same time they want to force the government to commit acts that would be highly embar rassing to these same foreign governments. It is not right to ask the Senate to endorse their spurious reasons for not signing off on this report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was certainly no opportunity denied to the committee to have all aspects of the scheme and government advice examined and cross-examined. AusAID and DFAT officials answered around 900 questions on the issue. They were questioned for over nine hours on four separate occasions, as were other departments involved in the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister on his part made thorough disclosures to the parliament through his statement to the parliament on 26 June 1996 and his letter to the Speaker dated 19 July. Despite considerable opportunity provided to opposition members to question senior DFAT and AusAID officers, the statements from the minister remain unchallenged and uncontradicted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition members' delay represents not only hypocrisy of the highest order but also short&hyphen;term memory loss. Do they wish to deny the following statements of their leaders? Their former leader, Paul Keating, in a statement to the House of Representatives on 4 November 1992 stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be no House of Representatives Minister appearing before a Senate committee of any kind while ever I am Prime Minister, I can assure you.</PARA>
<PARA>Their present leader, Mr Beazley, on 7 October 1993 stated in a motion that the House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . further resolves that it is not appropriate that any member of the House of Representatives be required to appear before a committee of the Senate against the member's will . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Whether they want to follow their defeated leader, Mr Keating, or their present leader, Mr Beazley, they have it from both that no House of Representatives minister is to appear before a Senate committee. How can they now claim the rules have changed with a change of government?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4169"> The minority report acknowledges the significance of the DIFF scheme as a tied concessional aid scheme delivering aid into Asian markets. Government members accept overwhelmingly the evidence received from Australian companies in support of commercial benefits that flowed to individual com panies from DIFF funding. Evidence was given of the export opportunities and internationalisation of Australian businesses and the opportunities for the development of technology. Expert evidence confirmed the Australian scheme had been tightened up to meet its aid objectives, with 85 per cent of aid being at the instigation of foreign countries following the implementation of the Helsinki report. Evidence was also accepted by all committee members that the government had signalled the end of the DIFF scheme prior to the 2 March election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow Treasurer's press release on 15 February stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In government the government would terminate DIFF from the start of 1996&hyphen;97, thus achieving savings of $123.5 million alone.</PARA>
<PARA>The then shadow foreign affairs minister, Mr Downer, had also in the lead&hyphen;up to the election made many references to his desire for aid programs to have a greater focus on direct poverty alleviation and community based activities. The difficult budgetary position bequeathed to this government has been acknowledged in all quarters, including acknowledgment and understanding by foreign governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As contained in the report, the announcement to terminate the scheme was made on 8 May 1996. The minister received advice on the termination and, in accordance with the advice, announced that the government would fund projects with companies that held formal offers and earmarked funds for that purpose. This left 85 projects that had reached the letter of advice stage. In many cases, significant amounts had been spent not only by the companies but by suppliers, joint partners and foreign governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The scheme, which has been in operation since 1982, has always had long lead times, and statistics of the small percentage of projects that proceeded to formal offers and signed contracts in one year were confirmed in evidence. In July, a priority round of extra projects was announced, with $32 million allocated this financial year and the next, making a total of $64 million. A selection of priority programs is presently proceeding in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cooperation with the participating foreign countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Government members believe the additional funding should go a long way to satisfying many of the projects that have reached the letter of advice stage and would have proceeded to a formal offer. Government members support wholeheartedly the government's independent and comprehensive review of Australia's aid program, to be chaired by Paul Simons, that was announced by the minister on 28 May, plus government ministers' statements on the possibility of a soft loans program as early as 1997&hyphen;98.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Subject to budget constraints, we believe there is a role for soft loan or tied concessional finance as a mechanism for delivering humanitarian focused aid. We have made reference to the Simons review to consider aspects arising from this inquiry. These include determining the multiplier effect, the flow&hyphen;on of trade, export opportunities and other commercial benefits to individual companies and the net economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The extent to which concessional finance advantages companies so they enter new export markets and internationalise their business, the extent to which the scheme can deliver positive development outcomes, and whether Australian companies would suffer any competitive disadvantage in the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region from exclusion from a concessional finance package are the important aspects for the future of a concessional finance scheme as a form of delivery for Australia's aid program&mdash;not the furphies and hypocrisies of the opposition members, who know full well that lengthy evidence confirmed the proper behaviour of the minister in revealing all within the constraints of the national and public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also recommend that the Senate should accept this report as final. Any delay is only to accommodate the purely political purposes of the opposition.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 26 June this year, I moved the motion which set up this inquiry and I participated in all the sessions of it. I wish to make a few remarks about its report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4170">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I turn to them, can I just say to Senator Boswell, my colleague opposite, that in the Watergate hearings thousands of hours of tape were produced as evidence but 9&half; minutes were missing. It was that missing 9&half; minutes which were critical to the judgment as to what the executive in that circumstance had done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is certainly true that DFAT has produced a wealth of material. In summary, it comes down to this: the questions we referred to the officer of the department were then referred on to the minister and we got no answer. When we wrote to the minister, the minister said the department had answered the questions. We are caught in that circular bind. It is the missing 9&half; minutes&mdash;if I can use that example&mdash;that is the question here when it comes to the role of the minister and the role of his office in fielding issues related to this inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I say, first of all, that my thanks go to the secretariat for the fine job that they have done and all who have made submissions to this inquiry, including both DFAT and AusAID. This is a major inquiry. The details have been given about it by other speakers in this debate. By my count, overall, 49 people represented themselves or organisations to give evidence before the inquiry and there were a large number of written submissions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people who came forward to give evidence were mostly major companies in Australia. Some of those companies are household names, but most of them are small to medium sized companies struggling to develop a foothold for themselves in the international marketplace. The inquiry commanded extensive media coverage and it was a major political event during its life. In broadbanding it, can I say that the Australian business community, who gathered here in numbers to present their views about the termination of DIFF, did so by emphasising a number of points.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The way in which the DIFF scheme was terminated by the minister certainly did, if you take your line across all of the evidence, embarrass Australian companies in overseas marketplaces. It embarrassed the business partners of those companies in Australia and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> overseas. It embarrassed the governments with whom they dealt and caused financial loss to many Australian companies&mdash;losses which were quite large. It caused the companies in Australia that supported those overseas companies and the recipient companies working as partners to the Australian companies in overseas marketplaces significant financial loss, not to mention the loss of trust.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know that in working in the Asia-Pacific area one builds up by strong, long commercial relationships as a common coin of trade and negotiation the element of trust. The evidence of the Australian companies to this inquiry was that this very important element of trust was broken by the way in which this government terminated the report. They will be struggling now to re-establish that trust because, whether we like it or not, in those countries what the government does is seen as what the private sector is committed to as well. While they will be trying to resurrect their reputation and distance themselves from the government, irreparable damage has been done to them by the way in which this scheme was cancelled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also important to note that DIFF was tightened by the OECD. What we are now talking about is a better focused scheme where the problems have been largely eliminated. You cannot compare the complaints and criticisms of DIFF in the past with the scheme that is operating now because the new scheme operates without complaint and efficiently and delivers on the humanitarian and poverty alleviation fronts as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a scheme which, on all of the evidence, has helped Australian companies establish themselves in foreign marketplaces and has led to follow on work and contracts for them which they win on a fully commercial business basis and results in a growth in Australian exports to the region. This scheme is very important at both a foreign relations aid level as well as at a commercial level&mdash;although the scheme does not commercially support Australia, it is targeted at foreign needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a minority report contained in the committee report. Government members have put in a defensive report to protect the government from the criticism that flowed <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4171"> very freely in the hearings. It must also be said that the existence of the minority report confirms some of the problems and criticisms that the opposition and the minor parties had about the cancellation of the DIFF scheme. The recommendations of the government members call for an enlargement of the terms of reference of the Simons inquiry to take account of many of the issues that were raised properly and legitimately in this hearing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government members' minority report and its recommendations are in a perverse way a tribute to the efficacy of this inquiry and the need for it. I think the most important thing the government should do now as a consequence of the evidence we have adduced over several sitting days, and which resulted in volumes of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, is honour all of the letters of advice that were given to Australian companies that they were in the pipeline and could continue to the next phase. It is absolutely commercially important that the government does that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the minority report, the government members of this committee said that there will be a fallout rate of about 25 per cent. If there is, the cost to the government at the end of day will be that amount less. The financial savings which the government has so craved by cancelling the scheme in the brutal way it did can still be made. But justice and honour will be done. Those Australian companies that have letters of advice telling them that they can proceed to the next commercial phase should get final letters of approval. If there is that attrition and fallout rate it will be done fairly. It will not be done by ministerial fiat. It will be done with well established rules. They will be filtered out according to the traditions of the scheme. That is absolutely important. I think it is important that Solarex be added to the scheme because that involves the rural electrification program in Indonesia. It is a program that ought to be considered in this whole package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Downer round&mdash;the round introduced by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to compensate for the criticism that he has rightly attracted&mdash;is a recognition that the government has mishandled this matter. He has gone about solving the problem in the wrong way. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> The right solution is the one recommended in this report&mdash;that is, to allow the companies to be tested in the normal commercial way by AusAID and if they succeed give them a tick and if they do not eliminate them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing about this report is that it is incomplete. We are unable to report to the Senate on the reference that the Senate conferred on us and therefore we have not been able to discharge the Senate's obligation. We have not been able to because the minister has not appeared before this inquiry and he has not presented material to this inquiry necessary for us to discharge the remit given to us by the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a serious matter. I believe that the minister should make the material available now. The recommendations in the report call for that and I support them absolutely. On 7 October 1993, in a debate in the House of Representatives on a motion calling upon a minister of the then government to appear before a Senate committee, the now Minister for Foreign Affairs, who refuses to appear before this committee, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe that the Treasurer should appear before the committee to give evidence. He should tell the committee what he knew at the time of the preparation of the budget papers last year.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to argue why members of the House of Representatives should appear before Senate committees when Senate committees are inquiring into public affairs which are of national importance. He makes a case against the motion moved in the House of Representatives on that day by the then government which was that ministers should not appear before Senate committees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Downer said at that time that ministers should appear. All I ask is that he conform to his own standard. He set that standard then. He is now hiding behind it. He is running away from appearing now. He should come forward and appear before the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have the results of a survey, conducted by Australian business, looking at their view of the minister's handling of this cancellation. It is universally condemnatory of the minister and is an expression of a lack of confidence in his ability to handle this matter properly. The only way the minister can deal with the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4172"> big question mark placed over his head by Australian business is to clear the record, appear before the Senate inquiry, adduce the material and allow the Senate to complete its reference and report to this chamber. I ask the minister to take heed of that advice and comply with it. I recommend this very good report to the Senate. It sets out all of the details necessary for the public at large and this chamber to come to a conclusion about the termination of the scheme.</PARA></SPEECH>

<STATE> (Tasmania)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(4.31 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to be able to take part in this debate. Coming from the state of Tasmania, Mr Acting Deputy President Calvert, you would know the importance of the forest industry and what these new regulations mean to the ordinary men and women of rural and regional Tasmania and its townships&mdash;such as Burnie, Smithton, Triabunna and now even Bridgewater, where the new mill is operated by the Briggs family.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am astounded that the Australian Labor Party are joining forces with the Greens on this matter. Indeed, the CFMEU&mdash;the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union&mdash;have told the people of Australia what they think of the ALP's actions in backing the Greens' motion. They have described it variously as a `sad joke' and as the ALP having `learnt nothing from its previous mismanagement of forest policy'. Mr Smith, the spokesman for this union, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ALPs lack of understanding of the importance of the forest and forest products industry to regional Australia coupled with its willingness to use the industry as a political football will ensure that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> voters especially those in regional Australia will continue to keep the ALP in opposition.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the defeat of the Coalition's export regulations would open up the opportunity for a welcomed increase in woodchip exports.</PARA>
<PARA>But of course the downside is that we would not have the capacity for three-year grants of licences. The union then went on to make a very perceptive comment. They suggested to the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, that it would be best if he:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . reallocated shadow portfolios so that the Shadow Environment Minister Carmen Lawrence and Shadow Resource Minister Neal O'Keefe were given other responsibilities more in tune with their obvious limited abilities.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the view of the CFMEU. The fact is that they have got it absolutely right. Those opposite know that this union on this occasion got the facts absolutely right when they said that the Australian Labor Party would remain in opposition because of this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It may be of interest to honourable senators to note the comments made by Gary Gray, the national secretary of the ALP; Barry Jones, the national president of the ALP; and Senator Sue Mackay. They delivered a report on the 2 March 1996 election to the Labor Party faithful in August this year. In that document, under the heading `Priorities/balance' the first issue they raised was `Woodchips, jobs and environment'. What did these people say about their own party? They said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The logging dispute and the blockade of Parliament exposed seemingly intractable conflicts between two of Labor's important constituencies, workers and environmentalists.</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, the Australian Labor Party at the last election were trying to straddle a barbed wire fence, and we know what happens to people who sit on barbed wire fences&mdash;especially when they get pushed off. What the Labor Party have done on this occasion is jump on to the Greens' side and thereby desert the workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last Sunday I had the opportunity to visit the electorate of Paterson, which is now so ably represented by Mr Bob Baldwin. I had the honour of providing a message from the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to the assembled <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4173"> throng of approximately 2,000 people in the township of Stroud. The Prime Minister had indicated his support and the benefits that would flow to that community in northern New South Wales&mdash;and to all communities around Australia&mdash;from these excellent export woodchip regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that community, the mood was that the ALP had sold them out on the issue of the forest industry. They had sold out the societies in these little townships. They had sold out the men and women. They had sold out the children. They had sold out the small townships and the small businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ALP report was not the only one to recognise the fact that the Labor Party stance on woodchips cost them a lot of votes at the last election&mdash;the New South Wales presentation also made the same comment. Under the broad heading `Campaign' and the subheading `Strategy', some perceptive comments were made by Terry Sheahan, the president of the New South Wales branch of the ALP and the chair of the federal election consultative committee, and Chris Raper, the vice-president of the New South Wales branch of the ALP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note that that committee consisted of such luminaries as Jim Snow, the former member for Eden-Monaro; Robert Tickner, the former member for Hughes; Bob Horne, the former member for Paterson; Maggie Deahm, the former member for Macquarie; and Paul Elliott, the former member for Parramatta. And the list goes on. Why are they all former members? Let us see what the report said. What does it tell us? That report said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a number of issues involving Ministers during the final term of the Government (eg Carmen Lawrence, The White Board affair and woodchipping) had damaged the image of the Party.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>If you recall, the Carmen Lawrence incident was a situation where a minister of the Crown had been found to have lied under oath, and she was allowed to retain her ministerial commission. The whiteboard affair related to Ms Ros Kelly who&mdash;`administered' would be an incorrect word&mdash;misappropriated millions of dollars of taxpayers' funds in what became <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> known as the sports rorts affair. Both incidents are a very sad reflection on ministerial responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ALP in New South Wales put woodchipping into the same category as the Carmen Lawrence and Ros Kelly affairs. Why? Because what the Labor Party was doing was blatantly and utterly dishonest and of no benefit to the workers that they allegedly represent. To a certain extent, I suppose I ought be cheerful and thank the ALP for once again selling out the workers to enable us to continue to garner the support of the blue-collar workers in seats such as Patterson and others in New South Wales and in Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we really need is an understanding of the benefits of these new regulations. It is all about security of resource. What will be the benefit of this security of resource? It will allow investment in this country. The Greens come to us all the time and say, `We oppose woodchip exports because the timber ought be kept in Australia and create Australian jobs.' But coming from the state of Tasmania, I know the game they play. Wesley Vale&mdash;they opposed it. They then formed a Green&hyphen;Labor accord government, and a project that was destined for the Huon in my home state was bought out with taxpayers' money to ensure that there would not be a use and harnessing of the resources. As a result, this condemned the people of the Huon area to ongoing unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now have a third project developing for the north of Tasmania and once again the Greens say, `We will support it if there's no pollution.' My goodness! Each time the honourable senator opposite gets into a car, pollution is caused. He himself does not abide by the same standards that he would seek to put onto a woodchip mill in Tasmania or the production of medium density fibreboard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4174">   Let us have a look at what has really been happening. The general uncertainty over forest policy in this country has had a massively destabilising impact on investment in this important industry. We frequently hear of literally billions of dollars of investment which would flow, in the main, to rural and regional areas&mdash;creating much needed em ployment&mdash;if there was greater security over resource supply to the forest based industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These problems are to be addressed through the establishment of regional forest agreements which, in addition to establishing a comprehensive, adequate and representative&mdash;CAR&mdash;forest reserve system, will provide the basis for an internationally competitive, ecologically sustainable, value adding, native forest based industry. Woodchips have been the public face of the forest debate in this country for many years. The arrangements under which they are exported&mdash;like it or not&mdash;are fundamental to the investment equation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The massive damage done to the timber industry last year by Labor's foolhardy two-stage licensing system should not be underestimated. The two&hyphen;stage licensing process resulted in key customers sourcing part of their needs from other suppliers because there was no guarantee they could secure supplies beyond the 80 per cent allowed in the first-stage licence. The customers never came back, nor did the jobs. The security which will be provided by the three-year licences under the new regulations will help our exporters restore Australia's credibility as a reliable supplier with obvious flow-ons for regional employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new regulations made by this government provide greater security for the timber industry in a number of ways. Firstly, they restore the licence volume stripped without any logical policy justification last year and, with it, hundreds of jobs. Secondly, they recognise the reality of native forest logging operations in this country&mdash;that they are driven by the need to provide logs for the sawmilling and value adding sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While a substantial proportion of the logs harvested are not of milling quality, good management practice in many of our forests demands that logging residues are removed so that the forests can regenerate. The alternative to removing the pulpwood is to burn it or leave it to rot on the forest floor. Both of these actions have negative environmental impacts and they just do not make economic sense. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask the young people in the gallery upstairs: how could it be environmentally sound to burn literally millions of tonnes of forest waste on the forest floor rather than export them? Surely it would be better to use that resource, get jobs for young people in this country and get some money back into Australia to ensure that the people who are represented upstairs in the gallery are not left with a huge legacy of debt that Labor left them with.

That is when those opposite, feeling the pressure, get up with frivolous points of order to try to stop the flow of debate. I want to make the point again, through you this time, Mr Acting Deputy President, that it is environmental vandalism to allow millions of tonnes of timber waste to rot or burn on the forest floor rather than using it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we don't use Australian forest waste, Mr Acting Deputy President, do you know what will happen? The world markets will rape the forests of South&hyphen;East Asia and South America. The question is: who has the best forest practices&mdash;Australia or some of these South&hyphen;East Asian or South American countries? Methinks the honourable senator knows the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4175"> answer to that but he will not have the guts to tell us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What makes sense is for this wood to be sold to help pay the wages of logging and haulage contractors, sawmill workers and other people employed directly and indirectly in the industry. Senator Lees, in her speech on the second reading of the Native Forest Protection Bill, made the point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . export woodchipping enables the native forest industry to spread its costs over a wider base and without this native forest logging would not continue in many areas.</PARA>
<PARA>What Senator Lees was conceding was that the harvesting and supply of pulpwood is an integral part of an integrated, value&hyphen;adding native forest based industry. Indeed, the production of woodchips is, in itself, a value&hyphen;adding activity. The value added is the difference between selling the wood for export and leaving it to waste and rot on the forest floor or simply to be burnt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These regulations also deliver specific benefits to sawmill operators. For the first time we have a licence category which applies to sawmill residues. You, Mr Acting Deputy President, coming from Tasmania, will recall how the Greens used to beat their chests in Tasmania and say, `You've got to look after the small sawmillers; they are the ones who are hurting.' Well, the small sawmillers support these export wood regulations, don't they? They think they are a great idea.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But where are the Greens embracing the sawmillers now? They cannot be seen anywhere because the bluff of the Greens has been called. We as a government have recognised the importance of looking after the small sawmillers and the Greens want to shut them down as well, once the pressure is put on. We have applied the blowtorch to their bellies and now they come out and say that these sawmill residues should not be allowed to be sold; in other words, the small sawmillers ought to be thrown on the economic scrap heap.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All processing operations, including sawmills, produce waste material. If they are not certain they can dispose of the waste, for example by selling it as woodchips, the viability of their operation is undermined. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> When we look at value&hyphen;added forest industry investment proposals, the capacity to dispose of waste economically is a critical factor in the final decision as to whether the investment goes ahead. If the only outlet for these woodchips is a massively oversupplied domestic market, the investment must be at risk as will, as a result, job opportunities and the lifeblood of a lot of our small towns throughout regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current woodchip export licences contain conditions which require exporters to source woodchips from sawmills as a first preference. Surely the Greens must applaud that but, no, they do not. They want to dispose of these regulations. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) has confirmed that these conditions will be retained in new licences, giving added strength to our commitment to value adding and job creation. These regulations ensure exporters will seek out sawmills as their first priority source of woodchip.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Additionally, the one million tonne category under which sawmill residues may be exported also covers silvicultural thinnings, the wood produced from thinning regrowth forests to improve their future sawlog yield. We thought the Greens and the Labor Party were all in favour of plantations but the Greens are attempting to overthrow today in the Senate even those regulations that will assist plantations. So their commitment is not to plantations, just as it is not to sawmills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Giving special treatment to silvicultural thinnings will result in the industry having at its disposal in the future a wood resource that provides a higher proportion of the high quality logs ideally suited to value adding. Many people in Australia would be surprised to learn that we as a country run up a $2 billion deficit in wood products. In other words, the amount of wood product we export is exceeded by $2 billion by the amount we import. There is a trade deficit in wood products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What these regulations are trying to do is allow us to export some of our waste to repair that imbalance. More importantly, the three&hyphen;year licensing will provide resource security. Once that resource security is there, people <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4176"> from the international community will look upon us a lot more favourably for investment. Once investments are here in this country we will have the benefit of even further value adding and even more jobs. That is what these regulations are designed to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I compliment the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) for his excellent article on page 15 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of Tuesday, 17 September 1996. Anybody who is genuinely interested in hearing the facts of the forest debate ought to read this article. In the concluding minute can I simply say that those who are concerned about wildlife ought to be reminded that the Greenpeace founder, Dr Patrick Moore, recently stated that there was not one proven instance of an animal species becoming extinct due to commercial forestry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That challenge has been thrown out to the Greens on a number of occasions. I did it to former Senator Chamarette. She was unable to respond. What we have had in this debate is a lot of mischief. I urge the Senate, especially those who still have an open mind on this issue, to support the regulations for jobs and investment in this country. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also rise to speak against this motion brought on by Senator Brown. I really believe that Senator Brown has little idea of the extent of the effect of his motion on the lives of those involved in the forestry industry in creating both anxiety and distress. Senator Brown was voted into parliament to represent Tasmania; yet, by his actions I believe he is prepared to sacrifice jobs in our state and forestry workers' dignity and livelihood in so many remote regional areas&mdash;not only in Tasmania but in so many forestry areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unlike Senator Brown, I take the problems of regional Australia and the forestry industries very seriously. I will represent them, I will not dismiss their concerns and I will not turn my back on them. They are people whose needs have to be met. I am interested in people all around Australia being able to earn a decent living by working in the forest industries under appropriate environmental guidelines. I believe in sustainable management in our forests.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday Senator Brown attempted to intimidate me into abstaining from voting on his motion because of a token holding in both Boral and North Ltd. Both companies are involved in resource development and have subsidiaries in timber harvesting. North is essentially a mining company. I do not hold any ministerial or executive position, and my holding is fractional in relation to the capitalisation of both companies. The capitalisation of those companies, I remind the Senate, runs into tens of millions of dollars. So the opportunity for exploitation or profit by me in my vote on this issue is absolutely minuscule. Therefore, I think that objectivity has to be brought into this debate. On the other hand, I do abhor the intimidatory tactics of you, Senator Brown, on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have planted more trees than perhaps any other person in this place&mdash;certainly more than Senator Brown. Even before Senator Brown set foot in Tasmania I was working behind the scenes to improve certain forestry practices&mdash;with a high degree of success, I must say. I think it is indeed unfortunate that Senator Brown continues to misrepresent or recount those bad practices of 15 to 20 years ago as if they are commonplace today. I remind the Senate that nowadays Tasmania has some of the most advanced forestry practices in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the purpose of the record, I have to state that also from time to time I have interest in woodchips and forestry as a primary producer. Among the reasons that my constituents have placed their confidence in me over the years is my experience, my knowledge, my interest and my strong representation in both forestry and agriculture. My interests have enabled me to represent my constituents in an informed and sensitive manner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tasmania has a huge resource in its forests. In addition to its native forests, thousands of hectares of plantations have been established both by Forestry Tasmania and privately. Timber is a renewable resource. It is a sustainable resource that could bring so much benefit to Tasmanians but, by his motion, Senator Brown is hell&hyphen;bent on preventing the creation of more job opportunities. No wonder <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4177"> Tasmania's unemployment is the highest in Australia&mdash;and Senator Brown largely has to carry the cross for that high unemployment rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know that sawlogs are felled under legitimate and carefully managed logging operations nowadays, and these sawlogs are cut from the main trunks of the trees. The sawlogs are used for fine furniture and decor such as we have in this parliament. The remainder of the trunk, the branches and the thinnings are most likely to be left on the forest floor. Unfortunately, there is little market for them. This residue can be left to rot or sent up in smoke, as my colleague Senator Abetz said, in order to clear the forest floor for further plantations. How can we condone such mismanagement of a precious resource? How could I as a duly elected representative of the people abstain from voting on this ridiculous motion which has far&hyphen;reaching consequences and allow these potential export earnings to rot on the forest floor, or to go up in smoke, when there are valuable export markets for these products?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To expedite the generation of new trees, eucalypts respond quickly to fire. Often the leftovers have been left on the forest floor or are burnt, sending off clouds of smoke and contributing to the carbon dioxide levels in our atmosphere. Does Senator Brown believe that this is the right way to go? If he were interested in anything other than getting his name splashed across the front pages of newspapers, to the detriment of others, he would be working towards a sustainable and balanced solution. But we do not see this. Instead, he knocks forest management practices, he knocks selected sawlogging, he knocks downstream processing and in so doing he knocks the economy to pieces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My colleagues, that is not all. You may have noted in his declaration of interests that travel and accommodation costs to and in Taiwan were paid for by none other than the Meinung Environmentalists. The trip to Taiwan was not to encourage a company to set up an operation to do more downstream processing of woodchips in Tasmania but to hinder that development. He does not even want Tasmanians to get a job processing <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> woodchips into pulp or paper in Tasmania, the state that he represents. I draw your attention to a headline `Taiwan Pulp Ready to Abandon Australia' in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of Wednesday 26 June:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Taiwan Pulp and Paper Corp has said it will look for an alternative site overseas if opposition from environmentalists forces changes to its plan to build a $1.2 billion pulp mill in Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Brown therefore goes to Taiwan, courtesy of the environmentalists, to jeopardise the development of downstream processing in Tasmania. More jobs could potentially be lost, and he has been voted to represent Tasmanians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To the other vested interests he has declared, Senator Brown by his own logic is the one I believe who should abstain from voting on this motion. Senator Brown, who tries to smear the integrity of anyone who opposes his view, is an office holder or financial contributor of $200 or more in any single calendar year to none other than the Bush Heritage Fund and the Wilderness Society. Based on his own reasoning of why some senators should abstain from voting on this motion, he should also abstain because of his vested interests in environmental movements. So I say: what stupidity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am surprised at the action of the Labor Party in supporting Senator Brown. It is not surprising that the CFMEU attacks the ALP on its woodchip confusion. A press release dated 14 October states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Secretary of the Construction Forestry Mining Energy Union's Forestry Division Mr Trevor Smith branded the ALP Federal Parliamentary Party a "sad joke" today over its decision to oppose the Coalition's export woodchip regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Smith said the ALP had learnt nothing from its previous mismanagement of forest policy and would continue to pay a high price for its inability to learn.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The ALP's lack of understanding of the importance of the forest and forest products industry to regional Australia coupled with its willingness to use the industry as a political football will ensure that voters especially those in regional Australia will continue to keep the ALP in opposition" Mr Smith said.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Union claimed that the defeat of the Coalition's export regulations would open up the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4178"> opportunity for a welcome increase in woodchip exports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"To see the ALP politically grandstand against the Government's export woodchip regulations on the basis that it is opposed to an increase in the woodchip ceiling is a completely illogical approach. A defeat of the Government regulations would see the current export woodchip ceiling removed" Mr Smith said.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Union advised ALP leader Kim Beazley that he would be in a better position to build ALP support in Regional Australia if he reallocated shadow portfolios so that the Shadow Environment Minister Carmen Lawrence and Shadow Resource Minister Neal O'Keefe were given other responsibilities more in tune with their obvious limited abilities.</PARA>
<PARA>What an indictment from one of the biggest supporting unions of the ALP in relation to this particular industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As honourable senators would be aware, there is a current ceiling of 5.251 million tonnes applying to all woodchips and this will continue under these regulations. An additional quantity of one million tonnes of woodchips are to be sourced exclusively from mill residues, and silvicultural thinnings form regrowth forests will also be allowed. Good forestry practice, I would have thought. In addition, there will be a case by case approval for the export of woodchips to be sourced from the clearing of degraded private forests for the establishment of hardwood plantations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This type of woodchip export would not fall within the ceiling. They would be permitted only if the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson), in consultation with the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill), were satisfied that the forest in question did not contain high conservation values which could potentially meet shortfalls in a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This decision is not one that has just been dreamt up. It is the result of extensive consultations with all of the stakeholders and represents a balanced approach to a very complex issue. It is a firm and balanced decision, as the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and the Minister for the Environment said in a joint statement on 11 July. It is a firm and balanced decision on behalf of the entire Australian community in the national interest. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> It is a decision for the environment, for greater security and for jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Woodchips will continue to be exported under the regional forest agreements but it is not a case of open slather. There are controls, and very stringent controls. The industry will be very carefully managed to address the interests of all sides. The strategy is one that is integrated. It allows for the long-term sustainability of our forests and enables us to maintain our international competitiveness. It enables the industry to plan ahead and use our natural resources efficiently and effectively while bringing long-term benefits to industry and conservationists alike.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What Senator Brown must face is that, in a sinister attempt to smear fellow senators and cut job opportunities in regional Australia, he is clearing the way for open slather on the amount that woodchip companies could export. What we could have in these regulations is a plan for sustainability and predictability in the forest industry, an opportunity for thousands of Australians to get real work and an opportunity for Australia to compete on world markets now and in the future. These regulations should not be disallowed, and I urge senators not to follow Senator Brown's motion.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should declare my interest in this debate for the information of other honourable senators. I am currently the state president of the forest division of the CFMEU in Tasmania. I guess I would be able to lay claim to representing one of the most important stakeholders in this debate: the workers in the industry. From that point of view, it is clear where I am coming from. I am totally committed to a prosperous industry and to the workers of the industry. I guess my record will attest to that. I will approach this debate from a significantly different approach and objective to that of Senator Brown. I will be supporting the disallowance motion, but I will do so on the basis of arguing a completely different approach.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, I am committed to ensuring the industry achieves its full potential, to seeing our current trade deficit&mdash;which has been spoken about in this place&mdash;in wood and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4179"> paper products significantly reduced or maybe even turned into a net trade surplus. Quite frankly, I believe we can achieve that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we do achieve that, we will create hundreds, if not thousands, of jobs for Australians, which will in turn generate significant wealth and benefits for this country. Unfortunately, I regret to say that the debate relating to forestry issues has always had political overtones. Little or no commonsense and logic have ever been applied to decisions that have been taken, especially as they relate to export woodchips.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can say that these regulations do nothing to alleviate that problem. These regulations are, in some respect, no different from those which previously applied. They are iniquitous and they weaken the previous criteria for downstream processing in this country. A key objective of any regulations or other regulatory measures ought to be to improve things, to bring about a better industry&mdash;one that maximises the utilisation of a very valuable resource and enhances the employment and wealth generating opportunities for the people of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, it should go without saying that regulations should and must take account of environmental requirements. These proposed regulations achieve none of these things. All the government has done is increase the ceiling&mdash;or, in fact, not have a ceiling&mdash;and substantially weaken the downstream processing aspects of the previous regulations. It has broadened the interpretations, particularly as they relate to degraded forests and other environmental aspects, such that they are almost meaningless.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just want to take some time to remind the Senate of what is happening in the industry and what has happened to date. If you look at the history of my home state of Tasmania, on which I can probably speak with more authority than any other state, you will find that we had an industry that developed primarily as a sawmilling industry. Sawmills were supplied with sawlogs that were taken out of forests essentially on a selective logging program. They were set up to cut very high quality timber.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What happened in the mid&hyphen; to late 1970s was that they realised that because they did not have the technology and the equipment to access some of the then remaining areas of high quality forests, they had to reduce significantly the volume of sawlog, particularly the category 1 sawlog, that was being supplied to the industry. They cut it by some 50 per cent. We then saw the introduction of woodchip licences, which were, at that time, designed to utilise what were residues from sawmilling operations, both in the form of head logs and the squaring of round timber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was a long time ago. We had two categories of sawlog in Tasmania&mdash;category 1 and category 2. We had veneer logs that were provided to the veneer industry. With the advent of woodchip licences and the export of woodchips, we have seen a dramatic increase over the years in the volume of timber taken from the forests of Tasmania. We have seen a decrease in the volume of sawlogs in category 1 and category 2 that are supplied to the industry. I think what has happened in my state is that the industry, particularly the Forestry Commission of Tasmania, has got itself caught in a situation where, because its revenue is generated from the sale of forest products, it is in a volume driven, revenue driven cycle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you also look at the old industry&mdash;if I can describe it in that way&mdash;it never had the technology or the expertise to cut some timber species. There was a legitimate argument for exporting some of those species of trees that they could not cut or dry and process satisfactorily. The other realisation that hit some of the Tasmanian Forestry Commission people in the face&mdash;the people responsible for the management of the state's forests&mdash;was that they were taking out the best trees, they had degraded forests left, to some degree, and they really had no plantation or regeneration program of any real worth being put in place. So they decided that they would have to embark upon a silvicultural regime that led to clear&hyphen;felling. In some areas, that has an application. I would argue that it has not been best applied, in many cases, in Tasmania. But all of those things added to the burden.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4180">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we just take one giant step forward to now, the reality is that not much has changed. We are still cutting down high volumes; we still have only two categories of sawlog in Tasmania&mdash;although some would argue that we have three; we now have a category 8, which is supposedly top end grade pulp logs. The other thing that has happened is that we now have the technology and the expertise to mill and process many of the species and types and qualities of logs that we once could not utilise simply because the technology and the expertise were not available. But it is now available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we see is the continuation of sending to woodchip mills logs that should actually be utilised in a way that I think will both prolong and enhance the value of Tasmania's forests&mdash;and this can also have equal application particularly in the states of Victoria and New South Wales&mdash;and this country's forests. We will achieve far greater benefits from the point of view of both employment and wealth generated if we make some changes to what is currently the pathetic way in which the timber of this country is being utilised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we look at how these regulations might go towards achieving that, I want to first go to the most recent regulations which were disallowed&mdash;the ones that operated when we were in government&mdash;and look at the requirements that were placed on applicants for woodchip licences. One particular aspect of the former regulations related to the applicant's commitment to value adding and processing activities in Australia, both now and in the future. That was designed to ensure that we started to focus, albeit in a very small way, on greater downstream processing in this country. I have listened to many members and senators say, `We want a pulp and paper mill in Australia. We want TPPC to build one, and we want this and we want that', and that government policy ought to reflect the opportunities and the stability to achieve that. I agree with that. But we do not see it in these regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to the problems this country has with the commitment of major exporters to downstream processing. I can give some examples of what the major players have done in the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> past to get themselves into a position where they can comply with the requirements of obtaining an export licence. There is the case of North Broken Hill and the games that I believe they play in making announcements about their commitment to downstream processing. They have done this year in, year out. Yet we have seen no real change, no real commitment to downstream processing in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some few years back North Broken Hill took a decision that they were a resource supplier. I do not have any contention with that. If that is their position, that is fine. But I do not believe that it ought to be acceptable in the public interest that this Senate and this parliament accept that we allow companies which clearly flout the rules of the day to get away with it. We have a responsibility to the community as a whole to ensure that, if we have resources, benefits are maximised from them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By way of example I want to refer to a couple of press releases which were put out in late 1995 prior to the issuing of the 1996 licences. North Ltd issued one on 27 September 1995 headed `The pre&hyphen;feasibility for MDF plant at Triabunna'. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">North Forest Products today announced a pre&hyphen;feasibility study for a medium density fibre board plant at Triabunna, the first such plant in southern Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course it paints a very rosy picture. I do not know how you have a pre&hyphen;feasibility study into a feasibility study, but I am quite sure North have done nothing about this. This was just grandstanding. What they did not tell us was that with regard to MDF plants you need a reasonable supply of water. Triabunna always has a real problem with water, even for the town water supply. I do not know where North intended to get the water from, but I do know this: they never intended and never will intend to build an MDF plant. It is a charade that should be brought to an end. A further press release of 22 September 1995 is headed: `North opens Tamar flitch mill'. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">North Forest Products today announced the operation of a flitch mill at its Tamar export woodchip mill at Longreach north of Launceston. The flitch mill will be managed by North, be operated by <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4181"> employees at the Tamar mill and use equipment currently on site.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course it will. It did open. It used to be open before and it opened again, but it closed three months later. It does not operate today. The blokes who were working it are not working it today. There are no flitches being cut and nothing is being achieved with regard to any commitment to downstream processing. Again, it was a charade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other major company involved in exports of woodchips from this country is Boral. We read, `Boral may set up flitch mill'; `Boral eyeing north-west sites'; `Boral's announcement on Thursday that it had agreed with Forestry Tasmania to feasibility studies'. They are not going to have a pre&hyphen;feasibility study, just a direct feasibility study. We read that they are `examining a $100 million hardboard factory, a $10 million recovery sawmill at Longreach and a $10 million veneer plant. But I do not think there has been any feasibility study with regard to those things either. They again just represent some grandstanding with regard to the former criteria. Those criteria did require the applicant to give some demonstration of commitment to value adding and processing in Australia, both now and in the future. The minister's statement on hardwood export policy says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Export licence conditions have been included to give priority (in decreasing order) to woodchips sourced from sawmill residues, reject logs, logging residues, silvicultural thinnings and silvicultural residues (these terms are defined in Attachment D). About 2 million tonnes of woodchips sourced from sawmill residues will be exported in 1996 . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That figure of two million tonnes represented about 40 per cent of the total volume that was proposed to be exported from Australia in 1996. That being the case, the statement goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is committed to ensuring that the proportion of exports not derived from genuine value&hyphen;adding activities is decreased over time. The ultimate goal is to maximise domestic processing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government will continue to favour value&hyphen;adding proposals when assessing woodchip licence applications. . .</PARA>
<PARA>That was a situation where we took a very small step. When we were in government I <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> was always critical of our approach in dealing with woodchip licences. But we did take a very small step towards beginning to get companies to value add and downstream process in this country. I wish to give an example of how I think the industry in Tasmania&mdash;I have said this before&mdash;is either corrupt or so pathetically managed that it is incomprehensible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1992, a person named Al Corbet came to see me. He is a Queenslander who has a company called Asia Pacific Resources. He had a proposal to set up three flitch mills in Tasmania. They would have utilised about half a million tonnes of logs that were then being chipped. He went to the Forestry Commission with that proposal and also to the Tasmanian Development Authority. The Forestry Commission said to him that they were somewhat sceptical about his view regarding the potential recovery. I add that all of those flitches were to be exported. It was a totally export oriented proposal. None of them would have been sold on the domestic market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Forestry Commission said a few things. It was sceptical about his claim regarding what could be recovered. He conducted some trials to prove that. He also received a letter from the Forestry Commission. This is why I say it is critically important that, at a federal level, where we have a capacity to determine how the industry will be driven in terms of value adding and downstream processing, and we only have it through the Export Control Act, we at least do something about it. This is a really good example.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Forestry Commission said to Mr Corbet, `Fine, we'll sell you the logs. If, at the end of the day, you can prove that what you say is right, we'll sell you the logs. But what you have to do is go to see North Broken Hill and you have to seek an arrangement with them that will allow you to sell the residue from the processing of those logs.' Of course, when you are processing low grade logs, you always get a higher percentage of residue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that letter the Forestry Commission also said that his negotiations with North Broken Hill must not interfere in any way with the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4182"> current arrangements that existed between Forestry Tasmania&mdash;what was then the Forestry Commission&mdash;and the particular company; indeed, it must not reduce the quality of that company's exports, that is, its chips.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have to question: what are we really on about? What is Forestry Tasmania on about? As Senator Hill or Senator Parer said yesterday, the states have the responsibility for the way in which forests are managed and harvested. That is true, but if we see things that are wrong or if we see that there are not practices in place and there are not efforts being made at a state level to guarantee that this country maximises its opportunities from its forest based industries, we ought to do something about it. As I said, we do have the capacity under the Export Control Act to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it did not stop there in terms of this person. He owns a sawmill on the north&hyphen;west coast of Tasmania called Precise Timbers. That is what it used to be called. He completely rebuilt it. He sought to purchase logs from Forestry and also from North to supply that mill. Twenty&hyphen;five people could have been employed. His access to the mill was across crown land. The minister of the day sold the land to another sawmill owner next door who took out an injunction to stop access to this mill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Forestry Tasmania said, `Well, you are not a complying mill now because you have no access.' Of course, who owned the sawmill that acquired the land? It was a former management employee of North Broken Hill. You have to wonder, if there is not collusion somewhere there, why it is that somebody who says `I want to employ 25 people, I want to run a sawmill, I've got a sale for the timber' cannot get the sawmill up and running.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does not stop there, either. He proposed to build a sawmill at Bridgewater. All the plant and equipment is sitting at Bridgewater waiting to go together. Unfortunately, the land that he purchased happened to be land on which it was proposed, although nobody knew it, to construct part of the national highway. Websters, a rural based company in Tasmania, did not know that. When they found out, that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> prolonged the period of time involved. He had an agreement with Forestry that he would meet certain time commitments. Forestry then opted out and said, `You didn't meet the commitments, therefore we don't want you.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I read the other day in the paper that the Country Sawmillers Association seem to have come to some agreement with North Broken Hill, I have to say under threat. A couple of people from Country Sawmillers said, `North has really got the arm twisted up the back here. They don't want us to put in an application for a woodchip licence. If we do, we're likely to suffer the consequences.' The consequences that they would suffer are simply these: the price for their residue from sawmilling operations would be reduced or refused, because under the current rules in Tasmania, that is what North Broken Hill can do. Again, that is unacceptable. You cannot allow those practices to continue. We have an obligation to ensure that in issuing export woodchip licences we do not allow that to continue. Those are just a few examples.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I propose to seek leave to table photographs of logs that have continually been going to woodchip mills. In this case these logs are going to Boral's woodchip mill. I am quite happy to provide them to Senator Parer so that he can look at them. I will then seek leave to have those photographs tabled. I can remember seeing on the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian </EMPHASIS>newspaper last year 10 or 12 people who lost their jobs at the Coolah Tops sawmill in New South Wales. They were sitting on a pile of logs, the last logs that they had to cut. When you see those logs and think about those people who lost their jobs, you have to wonder what we are really doing in this industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As you can see from the examples that I have provided&mdash;and they are but a few&mdash;the proposed regulations do nothing to rectify these problems. I know the government will say that it is rubbish, but let us have a look at what is proposed. As I said before, under the pre-existing regulations at least two million tonnes, or around that, of wood for woodchips were sourced from sawmill residues. The proposed ceiling has been lifted by one million tonnes. But in reality, as I said <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4183"> earlier, there is no ceiling, simply because of the degraded forest licences and trial shipment licences. This is exacerbated by the very loose definitions that are proposed, especially in the area of wood sourcing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us go to the proposed regulations in terms of the definitions and look at what residue woodchips are. They mean `control of woodchips derived from sawmill residues or silvicultural thinnings'. It says `or silvicultural thinnings'. It does not say one thing. It does not say `sawmill residues'. There is no definition in here of what sawmill residues actually are. They could be anything. At least under the old regulations that you disallowed there was a specific definition for sawmill residues&mdash;very specific.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Page 4 says that `silvicultural thinnings' means `waste material resulting from thinning of regrowth forest for the purpose of improving the production potential of the forest'. That can mean anything. Let us go to the issue of `regrowth-old growth'. I asked the minister's office to explain to me what was their interpretation of `old growth-regrowth'. They said, `It's in the national forest policy statement.' I had a look and said, `What about the age difference?' They said, `It has nothing to do with age.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me tell you, Senator Parer, that in Tasmania regrowth forest is considered to be anything less than 150 years old. Then you take that and you think, `Hang on. Haven't we been running an argument about an 80-year rotation for the production of sawlogs?' None of this gels. None of it fits; none of it stacks up. We have an obligation in this place to do something about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, in terms of the process, silvicultural residues and sawmill residues are not defined. `Degraded forest' is basically being left up to the minister of the day to say, `Tom, Dick, Harry or Sue have the expertise to determine what a degraded forest is.'</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have to understand that the world has a shortage of timber and we have a responsibility to maximise the use of it. More and more consumers are going to demand that. We know that there is a change in the view of consumers around the world. Therefore, we have an even greater obligation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No-one in the debate thus far&mdash;particularly the two ministers responsible, Senator Hill and Senator Parer&mdash;has made any comment or provided any reasons as to why the definitions have been weakened and what benefits will be had from weakening the definitions. It certainly will not lead to increased downstream processing in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moreover, even if we in the interests of the industry voted for these regulations in good faith, there are other issues that demonstrate that the government is not genuine about real industry development, about having an industry that will focus on import replacement and the creation of jobs and wealth for Australians and Australia. I will give you one example of why I make that statement, and that is the removal of funding for unions and others to participate in an appropriate forum such as the Industry Council and in a way that would allow a genuine and open approach to industry development. If for no other reason, these regulations do not address any of the real issues confronting Australia's forest industry.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The previous speaker, Senator Murphy, has raised some very serious questions indeed. I believe the government should look at those questions that Senator Murphy has raised and not just hide behind the fact that the management of the forest industry is essentially a state responsibility. The Commonwealth government has not shied away from using its powers under the constitution to influence states to perform better in a range of areas. I believe the government ought to do this now by using its powers under the constitution and in accordance with the Export Control Act. It may well be that ultimately the Export Control Act will need to be amended. I will come to that shortly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Senator Murphy has raised some very serious questions indeed. As I understand it, he is saying that there ought to be a true incentive for the industry to encourage downstream processing and that these regulations should focus on the source of material for woodchips. I concede that it does not do so. The regulations extend the definition of `residue woodchips'. As Senator Murphy indicated, the definition is broader than what was contained in the now disallowed regulations of the previous government. Under these regulations, residue woodchips mean `control of woodchips derived from sawmill residues or silvicultural thinnings'. Senator Murphy indicated it was estimated that 40 per cent of the export woodchips in 1996 were sourced <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to the residue woodchips from downstream processing units. I am convinced that the government should seriously look at this question so as to give true encouragement to downstream processing. Senator Murphy has raised this issue fairly and squarely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people of Tasmania have often been told of proposals for future investment in Tasmania, particularly in the regional areas, and nothing has come from them. He referred to press releases from the North Broken Hill Company and from Boral. Those companies should bear in mind that they do have a responsibility to Tasmania. They always say that they adhere to that responsibility but, in the area that Senator Murphy has referred to and in the specific statements that have been made by those two companies, they have failed in that responsibility. I hope that they hear what is being said here and that they do take it on board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not to say that they are not reasonably large employers in Tasmania. North Broken Hill provides considerable employment, but it does so because it is privileged to be able to exploit the resources of the state. I know the company will say that there needs to be an extended definition of what are residue woodchips and that there needs to be an additional provision for degraded private forests. I think it could probably reasonably justify its view on that, if it is talking about the long&hyphen;term establishment of native forests for the purposes of ensuring a future resource, and I acknowledge that point. No doubt, that is one of the reasons that the government has specifically made provision for degraded private forests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I certainly will be and I think the parliament should be very alert as to how those particular degraded private forests are determined. There are provisions under these regulations for that, but there should also be some sort of surveillance. I know the minister's office intends to do this, but from time to time the parliament should have reports as to how that is operating so that we can consider those reports and take policy decisions on them. Senator Murphy has made some very valid points. I agree with him that further focus should be made on the source of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4185"> the woodchips, because that will influence, to some extent, the requirement for downstream processing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Brown, in moving his disallowance motion, did not do his cause good in that he seemed to indicate there was a lack of faith or goodwill on the part of those who were involved in developing these regulations. Senator Brown should just forget about calling everybody slashers and burners of forests. I have heard that. He even called me that. When my family heard it, they burst out laughing, knowing of my association with the bush. I would rather be there now than here. I spent last weekend in Canberra and went out to Namadgi National Park for seven hours on Saturday and another six hours on Sunday. I looked out of my office window just a while ago towards the Brindabellas and wished I was up in that neck of the woods today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important for Senator Brown to realise the sensibilities and niceties of this place. You do not get anywhere by imputing bad will or a lack of goodwill. In my view, one ought to take it for granted that people do have goodwill. That is not only a piece of practical advice but the right and proper thing to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Brown should realise that sometimes we meet in this place to get the place working properly. We do that in the leaders meeting. I was quite surprised to read a press release by Senator Brown revealing publicly what occurs at those private meetings of the leaders. Those meetings, by the way, are privileged meetings. I thought they were privileged. The leaders and the whips get together at those meetings to see that this place works properly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his media release of 26 September, Senator Brown said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At a recent Senate leaders meeting I said that a private member's bill coming from the House of Representatives should not queue jump over private senators' bills originating in the Senate. I am very concerned at moves by Senator Harradine to have Kevin Andrews' bill expedited up the priority order in the Senate. At the next Senate leaders meeting on 8 October I&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, Senator Brown&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">will be insisting that the Andrews bill is placed below all private senators' bills already introduced. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>To be quite frank, I cannot recall what I did at that meeting. I do not think it is terribly important. If we are going to change the rules around this place, I would be happy to know it. If those private meetings, to which people go in good faith to try and get this place running properly, are ones where we are able to go out and tell the world what happens there, that is fine. I am happy about that, provided that I am told the rules.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been here a fair while and I always thought that those were the rules, that we do meet on occasions in good faith to see things work out properly. I just take the opportunity of saying that you do not do the cause any good by reflecting on the integrity of people in this chamber, as I believe you did when you introduced this disallowance motion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of things have been said here. Quite frankly, I have been very seriously considering supporting the disallowance motion. I was very impressed with the contributions. I was concerned particularly about the comments made by Senator Murphy. The government must have regard to what he has said because he knows the industry backwards. My problem is that, if I vote for the disallowance motion&mdash;I do not know whether it will be carried or whether it will not be&mdash;we go back to the 1986 regulations. Frankly, there were no ceilings under the 1986 regulations&mdash;none at all. From memory, even under the previous regulations there were no ceilings in the regulations themselves. What happens under those circumstances? The government could attempt to implement its policy under the 1986 regulations. I am correct, I think, in saying that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. We should bear in mind that it will be limited. It has been suggested by the government that another million tonnes would be involved.

That must be of concern to everybody because if there is no ceiling specifically mentioned in the regulations then what do we have?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government may well try to implement its policy, including its ceiling under the old regulations, but it will be an administrative decision subject to appeal. For example, a person who has made an application for a licence may appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. You could have a situation, and I suggest you probably would have a situation, where the government could have a ceiling of five million tonnes or so but export woodchips would go over that ceiling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is precisely what happened under the previous administration. There was no ceiling. There was a government policy for a ceiling, but there was no ceiling in the regulations so there were appeals to the AAT. The net result was that additional woodchips were exported.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that the government and the companies have regard to what Senator Murphy has said.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;Senator Harradine has just outlined his argument which really is tipped in the balance by the fact that these regulations, if disallowed, would leave no ceiling on export woodchipping. That is the salient point of his argument. By interjection Senator Murphy pointed out that if the right thing was done by the timber industry these ceilings would not matter. In the last 60 seconds of his contribution Senator Harradine showed the contradiction in his position. It is not consistent and it is internally contradictory. It begs the question of voting for regulations which head the forest industry in Australia in the wrong direction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I compliment Senator Murphy on much of the contribution he has made, in particular the revelations about the way in which this industry is mismanaged by those at the very top. Both the Forestry Commission in Tasmania&mdash;and the same applies to forest authorities in other states&mdash;and the big woodchip companies have an inordinate power to sway the decisions on forests in their favour and against the interests of the small players who are the real job creators and who are essentially the downstream processors in this country. That is where the jobs in this industry ought to be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The industry ought to be plantation based, and it ought to concentrate on downstream processing. But, instead of that, we have a situation where politicians and governments bow to the dictates and the power of these giant export woodchip companies. With the regulations that the government wants, we have in place toothless, parliamentary resolutions so that what happened before can happen in the future. If these regulations are <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4187"> not disallowed, the outcome will simply be that we will see a faster rate of destruction of Australia's grand and ancient native forests on the altar of profit of a few mega woodchip companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason the ceiling does not matter is that it is so high that we do not have an export woodchip capacity. There is no requirement from overseas to sop up the extraordinary amount of forest that is allowed to be cut down under these regulations in the name of a properly regulated industry. It is a sham, and these regulations are a sham.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whichever way one looks at it, the outcome will be that we will have the fastest rate of cutting and destruction of Australia's heritage forests in all of history, and at a time when we have less of those forests left than ever before. If that is not irresponsibility over the management of our forest resource, I ask what is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I referred yesterday to that forest resource. Let me look at the environmental side of it. Through the nod of the minister&mdash;and I do not mean the Minister for the Environment; I mean the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the minister in charge of logging&mdash;these regulations will enhance the capacity of the industry at a national level to continue to erode into the wild forests of New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia, Tasmania and, potentially, Queensland. Those areas include the habitats of nationally recognised and celebrated rare and endangered species such as the koala, the Leadbeater's possum, the long footed potoroo, the red tailed black cockatoo and the white goshawk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have forests of national estate value in several states which will face the chainsaws and the bulldozers under the direction of these regulations. In Tasmania, my home state, we have the Tarkine, the Great Western Tiers and the Picton, Huon and Weld valleys. These are forests which are recognised as being of World Heritage value but, sadly, they are outside the current World Heritage boundaries and will be targeted by the export woodchip companies as they broad deeper and deeper into these majestic, green domains.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On top of this, yesterday in Newcastle the Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Parer&mdash;the minister responsible for so much of what happens in our forests&mdash;gave us a warning in relation to this. He said that, if the decision is that small forest reserves will come out of the current process&mdash;that is, where 10 or 15 per cent of a regional forest is set aside for protection&mdash;he is not going to abide by it. Where those forests are left standing, he is going to open the way for them to be dug up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the minister has made clear is that, as far as this government is concerned, no forest reserve will be put aside without first giving access to the mining industry. Senator Parer's solution, as he calls it, for Australia's forests was this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have therefore determined that Regional Forest Assessments must include at least broadscale assessments of mineral prospectivity.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our objective is to ensure that any new forest reserves set up under the . . . process provide for management plans which do not unnecessarily exclude access for mineral prospect exploration and, subject to environmental procedures, mining.</PARA>
<PARA>So what is left of the forests&mdash;that is, what is not cut down&mdash;will be open to be dug up under the direction this government is taking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why is it that 80 per cent of Australians are opposed to the continued destruction of our forest heritage yet are so comprehensively ignored? The answer is the woodchip companies themselves and the extraordinary lobby they have in this place and in state parliaments around the country. They have such sheer power, a power which the patch in the pants conservation organisations cannot hope to meet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that at least $3 million a year is spent by the logging companies on public relations&mdash;and that is tax deductible. A large fraction of that is subsidised by the taxpayers. Who could blame the Wilderness Society for turning up at the opening of the Streeton exhibition last week in New South Wales? North Pty Ltd, the biggest forest destroyer in Australia, is trying to put a thin gloss of green over its ugly, chainsaw reputation by funding an art exhibition. That, I submit, besmirched the name of a great Australian artist.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4188">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Beyond that is the matter of political donations. Today Senator Murray released some figures about how these giant corporations put cheques into the coffers of political parties. For example, if you look at companies like Wesfarmers and Boral, something between $300,000 and $500,000 went from those corporations to the Liberal-National Party&mdash;and even Labor Party&mdash;coffers in a two-year period.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Does that make it right? Does that mean that the coalition sitting opposite is not at all influenced by the fact that hundreds of thousands of dollars from these woodchip companies are going directly into their campaign coffers? If that is not the potential for wrong influence against the interests of the Australian people&mdash;that 80 per cent&mdash;and our forests, I ask: what is? Senator Murphy used the term `corrupt' in referring to some of the practices that go on in the forests. I submit that that is corrupt. If it is not, it is certainly the template upon which corruption can flourish.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Beyond that we have to look at the self&hyphen;interests of politicians in a more direct sense. I reiterate that you cannot disconnect a direct interest of people who are voting on an issue like this from the interests of the companies themselves. The Boral company, as compared with last year, is applying next year for a 16 per cent increase in the rate at which it converts our forests into woodchips. That is in Tasmania. In New South Wales, it wants to expand, under these new regulations, from 403,000 tonnes to 730,000 tonnes. It is applying for an 81 per cent increase and it stands to get it under these regulations. In Western Australia, WA Chip and Pulp wants to go from 750,000 tonnes to 900,000 tonnes&mdash;a 20 per cent increase. These regulations are paving the way for increased conversion of forests to woodchips and increased, in commensurate amount, profits that those woodchip companies make.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> There happen to be a number of senators who have shares in those companies. In leading up to that matter, Senator Vanstone referred, on 17 March 1994, to the senators' register of interests. She said that the register <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and disclosure alone were not enough to make a real impact on the potential for conflict of interest. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We establish a false sense of security in the community that we do not have to worry about people's interests because they are disclosed.</PARA>
<PARA>She went on to give an account of her husband's sale of shares in a casino interest in the ACT which may have had some conflict because a casino was under consideration at the time. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We sold the shares because I did not want to be in the position of anyone being able to say, `Look, even though you are not government, in opposition you can make a difference to these things, whether or not you agree, whether or not you create difficulty'. If a casino had gone through with our support and Federal Hotels had had the opportunity to run it, I would have been very uncomfortable.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Vanstone also said something that I think is a very salient message to every senator, particularly to those seven senators opposite who were on the register of interests at the start of October as having shares in woodchip companies. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If people have a responsible position, they should make sure that they do not have a conflict. I think people should get out of the conflict rather than simply declaring it. I think declaring it is going halfway.</PARA>
<PARA>I agree with Senator Vanstone&mdash;declaration itself is going halfway. When there is a conflict of interest, it is required that the senator or member of parliament involved go the full way. Declaration is not enough. Avoiding the conflict is what is required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is not time for a divestment of shares, although all senators have known this matter would be dealt with in the near future. What is required is an abstention from voting in this matter.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When this matter was last being discussed I referred to the government's design to make the awards of this country unattractive to industry and employees by making the system weaker and reducing conditions for many employees. Those opposite want to replace that effective award system with a system of individual contracts that are to be called `Australian workplace agreements'. We are told that somehow this will empower employers and employees. I agree <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that it will give more power to employers. It will, however, severely disadvantage employees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should examine the government's proposition. Under their proposal, when a person applies for a job and the employer says during the interview, `I want you to sign this agreement', that person has no power in those circumstances; they are not even an employee. There can be no doubt that this will lead to job applicants signing agreements they do not like, just to get a job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is clearly no bargaining in this type of situation; there is no power for the employee. So much for empowering new starters, particularly the young who seek employment for the first time. There will be no power for new starters. Every time a person wants to change jobs&mdash;and there are many thousands of employees who do that each year&mdash;they may well be confronted with a demand, however couched, that they sign an Australian workplace agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about existing employees, those who are employed and have some form of contract of employment? What power will they have? Perhaps I should start with casual workers&mdash;and there are many in many industries. They have no guarantee of continuing employment. Some would say their contract of employment is by the day and that they start a new contract of employment every day when they start.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If an employer puts an Australian workplace agreement before a casual employee and says, `Sign', then they have a choice: they can sign, as the employer says&mdash;and probably continue to be called in for work&mdash;or they can refuse to sign and risk being dropped from the roster for someone who does. In my view, this is a form of coercion, a form of coercion that is impossible to deal with from a legal or a human point of view. These employees will have no bargaining power. Where is the empowerment of these employees that the government promises? There is a net loss to them in this bill. These employees will be as vulnerable as new starters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I turn to employees already in ongoing contracts of employment. What power is there for them in this bill? They can refuse to sign <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4191"> an agreement and stay under the award. However, if the employer offers them a choice of the award or an agreement which contains matters in excess of the award which already apply to them while removing access to other award provisions, the employee will be faced with an unfair challenge and possibly threat. That is, if you do not sign the agreement, those matters which are in excess of the award may not continue to apply because you have not signed an agreement which contains them but drops other award conditions. That will mean in some situations that a gun will be held at the head of employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the type of circumstance that I have regularly heard of from employers and their representatives when the question of the proper application of an award is raised with the employer. A common response&mdash;and I am talking about an employer who has not been properly observing an award&mdash;is, `If we have to meet this part of the award we will take away these particular conditions that are not part of the award.' This is the reality of bargaining in the workplace, and this system offers no empowerment to employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Employers and employees can already reach binding agreements without any change to the law, and the minister has already conceded this. It will simply allow employers to pressure employees to give up those rights contained in awards. There is no empowerment here. Even if there is a bargaining process without this imbalance, then who will hold the whip hand? Given that the bill prohibits any employee revealing the content of their agreement, how can employees bargain with any sound research or knowledge on what is achievable, what has already been agreed, and what similar skilled and experienced employees have been able to persuade the employer that they are entitled to?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The employer in many circumstances will have this information, so I would call this bargaining by employees a form of blindfold bargaining, if any bargaining takes place at all. If this is what government senators opposite call empowerment, then I think they are deluded and out of touch with the reality of the workplace. I would not have thought they <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> would be so naive as to have that view. However, the alternative is even less flattering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for employees' access to unions or other outside resources in the bargaining process, I believe it is likely that this will be even less accessible than it is now. I gave the Senate an example last Thursday night of employees being advised by the employers' industrial representative as to the detail of a proposed agreement. When a union sought to circulate a document which set out some simple advice for employees as to their rights, the employers' representative directed employees to tear them up and throw them in the bin. That is the real world in many workplaces. The employer has a powerful hold over employees, and it takes a very strong person to oppose the will of the employer. Some have the strength. Some can ignore the potential economic sanction of being unemployed. Most are not as strong, and most cannot afford to put their families' welfare in jeopardy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another question to be posed, and that is: will Australian workplace agreements become the contract of employment for employees? The contract of employment lasts only as long as the Australian workplace agreement is in force. That is, the term, whether it be one year or two, will be the term of the employment. At the end of the Australian workplace agreement, the employee is no longer employed and is in the position of a job applicant. They will have the bargaining power only if they have a skill that is in short supply; otherwise they will have no power, no empowerment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other question which arises is whether this will effectively remove access for many to the unfair dismissal provisions that this bill contains. That is, at the end of their contract they will not be an employee and therefore not have access to seeking reinstatement of their employment because they cannot negotiate a fair bargain with their employer about ongoing conditions of employment. The government's chest beating about maintaining those provisions may well be hollow claims given this possibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This aspect of the Australian workplace agreements provision is about empowering <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4192"> employers. It is a disgraceful breach of the Prime Minister's commitment that no Australian would be worse off with regard to their wages and conditions. It is a recipe for disharmony and discontent. It will create bitter people in the work force and will do nothing for productivity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am a member of the Australian Liquor Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers Union. I have spent most of my life representing many part-time workers, most of whom are women. Most of these women have had the benefit of an award guaranteed minimum daily engagement. This bill would remove that right for those women under federal awards. They are not highly paid, and they depend on a certain number of hours each day to make going to work each day worth it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I draw the attention of honourable senators to the cleaners employed in this building by a contract cleaning company. The impact of this bill will be to remove from the part-time cleaners employed here their current entitlement to a minimum number of hours each day. This bill will create the circumstances for a possible loss of income for the lowest paid workers in this building. The government is effectively attacking these employers with this bill. Why? There is no clear and discernible rationale available in the parliamentary debate so far on this matter. Can it be anything to do with empowering employees? Clearly not. It is in fact the opposite. Clearly it will disadvantage those employees. It will take away rights that they have now for no discernible reason.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to touch briefly on the disamalgamation provisions of the bill and particularly on the comfort that this government may have drawn from correspondence and approaches it received from Mr Peter James on behalf of the Liquor and Hospitality Division of the New South Wales branch of the Australian Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers Union in support of the disamalgamation provisions of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr James advised me at a meeting of the transitional national executive of that organisation that he drew his authority to support that aspect of the bill from a meeting attended by about 93 members. I further draw the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> attention of the Senate and the government to the fact that Mr Justice Madgewick of the Federal Court ordered that the office held by Mr James&mdash;namely, of the secretary of that divisional branch&mdash;had not been properly filled, and ordered that a new election be called. A ballot of members has been conducted by the Australian Electoral Commission and counted. Mr James was not the successful candidate in that ballot, although he was a candidate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would submit to the Senate that this is testimony of the fact that members of that part of the organisation Mr James purported to represent as supporting this part of the bill have repudiated Mr James's position and action in supporting this aspect of the bill. The government can now draw no comfort from Mr James's representations on the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is a disaster for employees generally in the service industries. Parts of these industries are represented by the organisation of which I am a member. In the hospitality industry, an industry that is highly casualised, the wages paid to employees will fall in real terms as a result of this bill and conditions will be reduced. Individual contracts will be imposed on employees quickly due to the high turnover of labour which now generally applies. This will have a negative effect on the morale of industry employees and will ultimately affect service and productivity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The growth and development of the hospitality industry in this country will suffer as a result of this bill. If it is passed, the industry will not be the polished and harmonious industry we would want it to be for the Sydney Olympics in the year 2000. This will affect the image of Australia and Australians. The government cannot ignore these effects when pursuing this legislation. There are many other service industries employing part-time and casual employees, and I have referred to the danger this bill poses to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, there are many aspects of this bill which require further attention. I understand that we will have the opportunity to address them when the matter is dealt with in committee.</PARA>

<TIME.STAMP>(6.41 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking this evening to the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill, I want to focus particularly on the impact this legislation will have on women. The existence of a centralised system for the making of awards setting terms and conditions of employment has historically ensured a higher level of protection for employees with little industrial strength&mdash;and, of course, that includes women. Comparing award rates of pay, women do comparatively well in relation to men but, on the other hand, comparing over-award payments, which are determined outside the system, women fare badly. The supplementary payments concept introduced since 1989, which has brought minimum award rates closer to over-award rates of pay, has been particularly important for women. However, over-award payments remain a problem for women.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The role of the Industrial Relations Commission through test cases has been crucial in achieving this result in terms of award relativities, especially the 1969 and 1972 equal pay cases. It has also been responsible for the introduction of conditions of work which are especially important for women, such as the 1979 maternity leave and, more recently, the parental leave and family leave cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is this strong award system which has given Australia a higher female-male wages ratio than comparable countries. The thrust of the government's proposed changes is to actually undermine this whole award system to a minimal wages floor and replace it with a system of individual agreements. This will, over time, destroy the achievements of the award system. This will have a particular impact on women. Before the election, the coalition promised:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The IRC will have a continuing role. Some employees and employers will continue to rely on awards . . . Accordingly, the IRC will continue to settle disputes and determine wages and conditions of employment. Awards will be updated as currently occurs.</PARA>
<PARA>Other promises were made:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under a Howard Government you can not be worse off.</PARA>
<PARA>And: </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will not force workers off awards.</PARA>
<PARA>And:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People will have a choice between staying on an award.</PARA>
<PARA>But the truth is that the government is designing a system which will destroy the role of the award system in protecting the wages and conditions of the low paid&mdash;that means particularly many women. The government will do this by changes to the award system and the system of workplace agreements and by removing the commission's jurisdiction to make orders for equal remuneration for work of equal value in the over-award area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The safety net that has been built up over time is a set of employment conditions contained in awards. Currently, the commission can update the safety net in each award to ensure it remains relevant and secure. The commission will arbitrate above the safety net in special cases, but the government is proposing to strip the commission of its ability to arbitrate above a basic minimum standard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is intending to limit the issues which can be included in awards. Even if the parties agree, clauses dealing with the following areas will be removed from the awards: the introduction of change, consultative arrangements, EEO and workplace harassment, redundancy, procedures for dealing with termination of employment, minimum breaks between shifts, superannuation, rostered days off, meal breaks, transport, trade union training leave, distant work, transport and fares, training and study leave, amenities, clothing and equipment, time and wage records, posting rewards, right of entry, and paid maternity leave.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of these provisions give women significant entitlements. It is unrealistic to suggest that most employees will be able to negotiate these provisions in an enterprise agreement, especially without the assistance of unions or an oversighting role by the commission administering a comprehensive `no disadvantage' test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has announced its intention to abolish paid rates awards. These awards set actual rates of pay as an alternative to over&hyphen;award payment. Paid rates awards apply <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4194"> particularly in the public sector where over&hyphen;award payments do not exist. The abolition of paid rates awards will particularly affect women in the public sector&mdash;nurses, teachers, community service workers and lower and middle ranking public servants. These workers are generally not in a position to negotiate enterprise agreements because of their employers' dependence on government funding. They will also be severely disadvantaged even if the rates in the current paid awards are maintained and frozen in minimum rates awards, as they will be unable to gain wage increases in the future. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Equal pay is a key issue for women and discrimination in over&hyphen;award payments is a significant source of the gender based pay gap. Women earn only 54 per cent of the over&hyphen;award payments made to men. This is an area of concern that has been highlighted by many women's organisations over the years and in reports such as the 1990 National Women's Consultative Committee pay equity report and the 1992 Human Rights and Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Just rewards</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The federal Labor government acted on this concern and in 1994 introduced new equal remuneration provisions in part VIA of the act, which gave the commission the ability to remedy instances of discriminatory over&hyphen;award payments. The ACTU, utilising these provisions, has had some major successes in negotiating the removal of clearly discriminatory over&hyphen;award payments, especially among female process workers in the manufacturing industry. The government now proposes to remove these important provisions, although nothing was said to this effect during the election campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Women in the Australian work force have been playing a continuing wages catch up with their Australian male counterparts in obtaining equal pay for equal work. The Australian Bureau of Statistics figures for the period clearly show that the male participation rate from the 1960s to 1995 has steadily declined while women's participation rate has steadily increased, with a marked increase during the 1980s as equal opportunity policy was promoted and with the passing of the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Affirmative Action (Equal Opportunity for Women) Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are members of government&mdash;though not all of them&mdash;who would like to see the abolition of the Affirmative Action Agency. In Saturday's edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gold Coast Bulletin</EMPHASIS>, John Bradford, the member for McPherson, said that he wanted to scrap affirmative action also and the ministry for the status of women. He said that affirmative action was `a product of the politically correct era from which we have just emerged', whatever that gobbledegook means. He is reported as saying that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The necessity for organisations to implement affirmative action programs and report annually on programs to the Affirmative Action Agency was a serious and unnecessary imposition on business.</PARA>
<PARA>I presume that is not the view of the government and that Peter Reith will ignore Mr Bradford's letter, which merely indicates that he is totally out of touch and not representing about 54 per cent of his electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A recently published report by the International Labour Office in Geneva entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">More and better jobs&mdash;an action plan</EMPHASIS> has pulled together past research and the outcomes from the Fourth World Conference on Women, held in Beijing in 1995 and the World Summit for Social Development, held in Copenhagen in 1995, to provide the basis for a better understanding of the dynamics and issues concerning the employment of women. Among the most notable of the report's conclusions is that women are affected more adversely by public service downsizing. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The impact of these measures tends to be particularly severe for women because, in the first place, the government sector is often the largest single employer of women workers . . . Secondly, wages and employment conditions are better on average and gender wage differentials are smaller in the public sector than in private wage employment . . . The tendency for women to be concentrated&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>The Inspector&hyphen;General of Intelligence and Security is a crucial position in the Australian intelligence community. It is the office through which accountability in our intelligence agencies is encouraged. The office is responsible for  assisting the relevant minister in overseeing and reviewing the activities of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, the Defence Signals Directorate, the Defence Intelligence Organisation and the Office of National Assessment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of these reviews is to ensure that these agencies act legally and with propriety, comply with ministerial guidelines and directives and respect human rights. The Inspector&hyphen;General's office conducts these reviews by way of constant monitoring of the intelligence agencies and responding to complaints against the agencies directed by the Inspector-General.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I begin my comments with the observation that the office of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security appears to be greatly under resourced; however, it manages on the most part to fulfil all its legal requirements and roles with relative efficiency and effectiveness. The two points highlighted by the report are: firstly, the lack of resources available to the Inspector-General; and, secondly, the Inspector-General's ability to deal with its basic requirements regardless of this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The workload of the Inspector-General has increased steadily since 1986, with a small drop over the past two years. This workload increased considerably in 1994&hyphen;1995 due to the work of the commission of inquiry into ASIS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To its credit the Inspector&hyphen;General's office managed to keep the average duration of the complaint process from increasing substantially. The only sharp increase occurred during 1994&hyphen;95 when also dealing with the aforementioned inquiry. As the Inspector&hyphen;General <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mentions in his report, efficient processing time has occurred with `only a very small office to help him'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report further highlights that the work of the agency is of a high standard. This is evident by a number of results:</PARA>
<PARA>firstly, in all cases, ministers have accepted the recommendations arising from reports completed during the years; and, secondly, with some minor exceptions, there continued to be broad acceptance of inquiry outcomes by both complainants and the organisation itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report also illustrates the work the Inspector&hyphen;General plays in encouraging internal reviews by the various agencies. An example of this is in regard to investigations of complaints against ASIO and the findings. The significant finding was as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The majority of complaints, upon investigation, are revealed to be unfounded. Nevertheless, some expose deficiencies in the manner in which the Organisation has dealt with particular matters and ASIO appears keen to learn from its experience to take corrective action, where this appears warranted.</PARA>
<PARA>Both the role of the Inspector&hyphen;General in highlighting problems in the process of ASIO investigations and ASIO's willingness to improve that process are reflective of the general thrust of the report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This brings me to the role that the intelligence agencies have played themselves in operating under the spirit of the legislation. In nearly all cases, the report illustrates cases where the agencies have established internal review procedures aimed at increasing accountability and efficiency of the complaints handling process. Additionally, the agencies have cooperated with the reviews and investigations of the Inspector&hyphen;General. For this illustrated commitment to accountability and cooperation, the intelligence community should be congratulated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One area that I feel the report fails to explain adequately is point 42, entitled `Extent to which there has been a change with the Agencies as a result of my Office's activities'. This section states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of recommendations were made aimed at improving the internal procedures of the agencies <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4196"> in the course of the year, in some cases, as a result of inquiries I conducted, or in others when the Office responded to requests for assistance or advice from agencies. During the year, the agencies accepted all of the recommendations of suggestions emanating from the inquiries I concluded.</PARA>
<PARA>It is encouraging to hear that recommendations to improve internal procedures have been accepted. I believe information in relation to what those recommendations were and which agency they relate to would be useful knowledge for the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most significant problem for the Inspector&hyphen;General's office is fulfilling its primary role&mdash;that is, to monitor the agencies under its jurisdiction. Due to the level of resources and staffing this has become secondary to reacting to complaints that are brought to the Inspector&hyphen;General's attention. This is highlighted in section 8 under the subheading `The Year in Review', where the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The commission of inquiry into ASIS found that the Office has become too complaints orientated to the detriment of its self&hyphen;initiated monitoring activity.</PARA>
<PARA>This issue creates the problem of the Inspector&hyphen;General being unable to monitor and possibly prevent problems occurring. As a result, the Inspector&hyphen;General involved himself with the intelligence agencies at a predominantly complaints level. Therefore, while the Inspector&hyphen;General and the intelligence agencies are working well in areas of accountability, additional resources could further enhance this process by increasing the chances of prevention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, the Senate can be pleased with the work of both the Inspector-General and the intelligence agencies in their review processes and cooperation between the various agencies. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The surveillance of intelligence agencies is always a major difficulty for a democratic society. It is one that we manage very successfully in this country. We manage it through two mediums: first, through the appointment of the Inspector&hyphen;General of Intelligence and Security, whose position was created in the mid&hyphen;1980s, with powers equivalent to a royal commissioner to inquire into all activities relating to the five intelligence <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> agencies; and, secondly, at another level we do it through the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note the way in which parliamentary committees have developed over the years. For example, the United Kingdom for years refused to acknowledge that there were any intelligence agencies operating at all in the United Kingdom, despite all the popular novels that have been written about them. In recent years they have set up the security intelligence committee, with oversight of all the intelligence agencies in the United Kingdom. Although they have only been operating for 18 months and the Australian parliamentary committee, which looks only at ASIO, has been operating for nearly 10 years, their ambit of operations is very much wider than what we have. I think it is a requirement in a democratic society that we move more and more to oversight. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the essential parts of that oversight is the Inspector&hyphen;General's office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things about intelligence agencies is that they are very much a closed culture. People tend to join an agency or be recruited to it and stay in it for life. It is different from the rest of the public service. If they have complaints about promotion, conditions of service or even selection itself, they really do not have the avenues of appeal that other avenues of civilian employment have. So the Inspector&hyphen;General has an important part to play in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous speaker, Senator Bishop, said something about the Inspector&hyphen;General's office being under&hyphen;resourced. I do not think it is lavishly resourced but I think it is drawing a long bow to say, given the volume of work&mdash;21 complaints last year&mdash;that a staff of six, as it is at the moment, is over&hyphen;stretched. I would be very surprised if that were the view of the Inspector&hyphen;General himself. I think for the present workload and the activities they have, it is probably adequate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Getting back to the need for oversight, the intelligence agencies in Australia are all restrained by the law of the land. The various legislative statutes that set them up are very strict in their restrictions on the organisations. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4197"> The agencies do observe those restrictions very much to the letter of the law, both with their own internal audit procedures on confirmation of their activities and through the independence of the Inspector&hyphen;General's office. In no sense are they running around with an Ian Fleming or James Bond type attitude. They are all, in my experience, very responsible agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of the five of them, ONA, DSD and DIO are intelligence assessment organisations. DSD collects, by technical means, the intelligence which it uses for assessment. So basically they do not come into much contact with the community at large.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">ASIS is the overseas intelligence gathering service. Again, it does not come into much contact with the Australian community, or no contact at all. So it is not surprising that, of the 21 cases listed this year, I think 20 of them relate to the activities of ASIO. That is because ASIO is looking after internal intelligence matters: politically motivated violence, espionage and activities of that nature. It does therefore come in contact with a large number of Australians through the year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the nature of things, there are those who feel they have been aggrieved. But, for the scale of its activities, to have only 20-odd complaints in 12 months and for the Inspector-General to find that the great majority of those complaints&mdash;probably something like 18 or 19&mdash;have no basis at all for further investigation is good testimony to the way the agency is conforming to the law and the spirit under which it was incorporated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, I think the Inspector-General&mdash;both the incumbent and his predecessor&mdash;has done a very good job with respect to the legislation that sets them in their position. I look forward to their report next year. In conclusion, the whole of the Inspector-General's position costs only $637,000 a year and we get good value for it. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>This is a very important report by the Australian Law Reform Commission and an excellent report in keeping with the many excellent reports it has put out beforehand. This is the third of three reports, dealing with disabilities in this case but generally dealing with the large number of acts that are administered by the Department of Health and Family Services. I will read part of the reference. That itself will inform people listening just how important this is. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 18 August 1992 the then Attorney-General, Mr Michael Duffy, referred to the Australian Law Reform Commission for inquiry and report a large number of Acts administered by the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services (as it then was). The Attorney-General did this at the request of Mr Brian Howe, then Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services. The Department is now called the Department of Health and Family Services and its Minister is Dr Michael Wooldridge. The Minister for Family Services is Mrs Judi Moylan. The terms of reference cover Acts that deal with Commonwealth service provision and Commonwealth funded service provision in areas including disability services, aged care, child care and health.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Disability services is the third program area being reviewed by the Commission.</PARA>
<PARA>Madam President, as you would understand, perhaps more than most, for a fair, just and generous society to operate, it must operate within a context of the law. What this report seeks to do is to get debate going about the sorts of laws that we should have to ensure that good services are brought to those who are in need in our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I can be allowed the indulgence: I notice that this reference was originally given by the then Attorney-General Mr Michael Duffy, who I think has now gone into the legal profession in Melbourne and is doing a grand job there. He was a great Attorney-General and it is a tribute to him that this report comes back now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the time available to me I would like to refer to a short summary of the introduction which is set out in appendix D of the report. That reads:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission recommends that the object of the new Disability Services legislation should be <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4198"> the provision of services to people with a disability rather than simply the provision of funds to service providers as is currently the case.</PARA>
<PARA>It is important that we, as a federal legislature, set our minds in perhaps a new way. It is simply not enough for us to pass legislation that ensures that sums of money of whatever size go to the people that need services as people who are disadvantaged in this community. Though money is needed, that should not be the prime objective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The prime objective ought to be the provision of the appropriate services to those people who are in need of them. When we work out what services they need, we can then work out what money is needed. Perhaps people would say that it is a subtle distinction but an important distinction. The other sentence in the chapter 1 introduction says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new legislation should be based on respect for the rights of people with a disability and its administration should aim to achieve high quality services to meet their needs.</PARA>
<PARA>We can only agree with that. Those two points go hand in hand&mdash;the provision of services that are needed, taking into account people's rights. That is the primary objective. Money comes as a secondary consideration to support those objectives.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the annual report of the Department of Industry, Science and Tourism, as it is now styled, and which was formerly the Department of Industry, Science and Technology under the former government. This is the annual report for 1995&hyphen;96. The previous government, of course, was the incumbent government for most of the time that this report refers to. I had the privilege of being minister for that department during that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just want to say a few words about the department. First of all, under the new arrangements&mdash;and I am not criticising them&mdash;the former secretary of the department, Mr Sandy Hollway, has been transferred and is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> now the secretary of DEETYA, the department that has replaced DEET. I just wish to record in the Senate my appreciation of the opportunity to work with Mr Hollway as a departmental secretary. He is a very fine secretary, and I am sure he will serve in his new role extremely well. I think he played an important role in leading this department, along with deputy secretaries Spasojevic, Trenberth and Bell.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a department of many fine officers. It is a good department and one that needs to be a strong advocate for industry policy in Canberra. I say that, Madam President, for the reason that last week you would have noticed that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> magazine's intelligence unit interviewed 55 chief executive officers of multinational corporations around the world as to the attractiveness of Australia as an investment destination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately for Australia, the 55 chief executive officers panned Australia as an attractive investment destination. They did so for a number of reasons, some of which are quite shallow. That is not a reason to criticise them, but it is perhaps a reason to make sure that we redouble our efforts so that we are able to convince them that they are wrong in that their reasons are obviously too shallow or too superficial.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of their criticisms of Australia as an investment destination is that our industry policy is incoherent&mdash;to use their word&mdash;and I think they have a point. The budget this year cut out of the industry portfolio a number of programs which are quite central for Australia to have an active industry policy. Those programs related on the trade side to the strength of Austrade and its ability to be an international market intelligence agency for Australian business so that they have a periscope into foreign markets at minimal cost to them and they are able to take advantage of market opportunity. The export market development grants scheme was slashed, severe cuts were made to the research and development program and chops and changes were made to industry policies, including the abolition of a whole range of bounties and a reduction in support for industry.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4199">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This springs from the erroneous idea that we apply business welfare in Australia, to use the term applied by some elements of the bureaucracy and picked up, unfortunately, by the new government. We do not. Business welfare is a superficial term used to discredit any real debate or serious discussion about industry policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the government needs to do in the post&hyphen;protectionist era for industry policy in this nation is to ensure that, while we do not bring back protection, we nonetheless have enlightened policies that encourage Australian companies to become internationally competitive, to grow our export dollar, to take a bigger share of international markets and to make sure that our manufacturing area grows to world standards. We need to stop selling cheap commodities like non&hyphen;value added commodities like wheat, wool, iron ore and coal and buying back sophisticated manufactured goods; we need to start developing the capacity to manufacture those goods in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that this is a cheap shot: styling policies which are aimed at driving the economy in that direction as business welfare. They are all policies which have been refereed, reviewed and demonstrated to create more value than cost to the economy. In fact, as a budget item, they have been cut as outlays. But if you were to consider their impact on revenue, the net balance is that the programs that have been reduced play a budget positive or a budget neutral role. Without those programs, we have a lopsided approach to dealing with the current account deficit but, more importantly, we have removed support from Australian business in order to become exporters and to compete on the world stage. This means that the job opportunities they may offer are limited and that their prospects are reduced. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>Genetic engineering is an issue that has been an interest of mine for many years. As I think everybody acknowledges, genetic science and technology are always way ahead of both the ethical debate and the legislative framework within which it can operate. That is a great concern. We never seem to catch up. I do not think it is necessarily the fault of the scientists or the technicians; it is the fault of those of us who perhaps ought to push some of these debates a little harder.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a very good report. I will be seeking leave to continue my remarks, because it needs digesting in a much deeper way than I can do tonight. By way of illustration, I refer the Senate to page 9, where there is a discussion about herbicide&hyphen;resistant crops. Clearly, all of us would want to endorse that science which enables us to produce crops that do not need herbicides or which are able to resist insect pests because of their genetically engineered characteristics. But there are some dangers. I will read from the report to underline what some of those dangers are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Possible risks associated with the use of herbicide-resistant crops include:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the risk of transfer of the herbicide-resistance gene to weedy relatives of the crop, giving rise to weeds that are resistant to the herbicide;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the risk that herbicides will increase and that this will encourage the development of herbicide-resistant weeds within the crop;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the risk that the herbicide-resistant crop may represent a weed in subsequent crops of a rotational system. The herbicide in question would then be ineffective in controlling such volunteer crop plants.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>The view of the advisory committee is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that a coordinated national strategy is required for the management of the introduction of herbicide&hyphen;resistant crops in Australia to ensure that the use of such crops does not result in hazards to the Australian environment or agricultural industries.</PARA>
<PARA>Let us underline those warnings. There is an incredible amount of experimentation going on. The scientists themselves can only point to some of the dangers of their experimentation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As legislators, we have not put in place the kind of framework which would give them more confidence in the work they do.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this parliament we have dealt with discrimination on the grounds of gender, race and disability. The time has certainly come where we should be dealing with discrimination on the basis of age.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In one case, four people who were pilots had reached the age of 60. Their employer wanted to dismiss them, not because they were not able to carry out their functions as pilots, but simply because of their age. That is a wrong approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I see, for example, on the ministerial benches opposite a person who has had a most distinguished passage beyond 60 years. He is a considerable surgeon and would be still carrying out great work in the surgery if he was able.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a waste of resources. But greater than the economic dimensions to the problem are the issues of human rights.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a great trend at one stage to limit people on the grounds of age. I remember a referendum in the 1970s where the age to which judges could sit in the High Court and the federal courts was fixed at 70. It was open before that.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Yes. I am advised that the AFP conducted a drug-related investigation code-named Operation Neon in 1986.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) I can confirm that a civilian volunteer did assist the AFP in the investigation of a drug importation from Hong Kong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) (a)&amp;(b) It is a long standing policy of the AFP that information concerning police operational matters, including operational procedures, should not be disclosed. Successive Ministers with responsibility for the AFP have endorsed that policy and adopted the practice of not revealing such</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) (a) No.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)&amp;(c) Operation Neon resulted in the arrests of three individuals; two were subsequently convicted and sentenced to terms of 12 and 15 years imprisonment respectively.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) The AFP has been advised by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (DIMA) that Mr Chan was an Australian citizen prior to Operation Neon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) DIMA has also advised the AFP that Mr Chan arrived in Australia in 1975, was granted residency in 1981 and was naturalised in 1982.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 16 September 1996 (<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  Page 3340) Senator Bolkus asked me as the Minister representing the Attorney-General the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is it not a fact that the South Australian Attorney-General, Mr Griffin, has publicly stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Commonwealth retreats from its [legal aid] obligations to the people for whom it has traditionally been responsible, the State Government is unlikely to be in a position where it can step in and fund the shortfall.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I also note that similar comments have been made by nearly all of Australia's state and territory attorneys-general. What are the implications for Australia's justice and legal aid systems, given that the states are either unable or unwilling to make up the shortfall in legal aid funding caused by your government's already announced decision to limit its traditional areas of responsibility in legal aid funding.</PARA>
<PARA> <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Attorney-General  has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am aware that the South Australian Attorney-General has publicly stated that the State Government is unlikely to fund the shortfall in the Legal Services Commission's budget resulting from the Commonwealth's intention to direct its funding to matters which arise under Commonwealth law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth will continue to fund legal aid for people in need who require legal assistance for matters arising under Commonwealth law. No reduction in overall legal aid funding will occur if the States and Territories recognise and honour their responsibilities to provide legal assistance for matters which arise under their laws&mdash;particularly crime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the present arrangements, the Commonwealth provides more than half of the total Government funds provided to legal aid commissions. In recent years, legal aid for family and civil law matters has not been given the same priority by legal aid commissions as assistance for criminal law matters. The Government believes that a proper apportionment of responsibility for legal aid between the Commonwealth and the States and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Territories will lead to a reduced requirement for Commonwealth funding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reduction in Commonwealth funding will remove what has been, in effect, a subsidy by the Commonwealth in funding matters arising under State and Territory laws.</PARA></ANSWER></ANSWER.TO.QWN></ANSWERS.TO.QUESTIONS></HANSARD>
