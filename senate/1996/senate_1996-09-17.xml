<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So should Senator Sherry because we had about two hours on the darned thing last night. All the details are contained in the budget. So far as the specifics of the question are concerned, provided that the small business owner or proprietor&mdash;whether an individual or proprietor&mdash;meets the tests laid down and set out carefully in the budget documentation, he or she will be eligible. What Senator Sherry's question is really all about is, `Why is the government prepared to go out of its way to do things to help the small business sector in Australia get back on its feet after 13 years of ravaging by an incompetent Labor government that paid no regard at all to the interests of small business?'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decision in the budget in terms of capital gains tax rollover relief is part of a series of measures taken in the budget and before the budget to give relief and assistance to help small business to grow, to create jobs and to provide a higher income and higher living standards for all Australians. As we know on this side of the house, even if Labor has not yet realised it, the small business sector is the engine of growth in this country and we are totally committed to ensuring that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> it continues to grow and develop in the interests of all Australians.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. I think we could take it as a yes to foreign owners being able to benefit from this measure. You didn't mention the words `foreign owners' once in your answer. Why should Australian PAYE taxpayers pay tax on all their income while foreign business people are able to avoid paying tax on capital gains income they earn from their Australian based companies?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are many companies in Australia that are foreign owned that are subject to Australia's taxation laws and subject to international agreements and the like, as my friend Senator Panizza said. Every taxation law in Australia relates to relevant people in Australia, be they foreign or Australian. The situation so far as this measure is concerned, being one of a multitude of measures that the government has taken in the budget to assist small business and lower and middle income Australians, is no different in that concept from any other part of the taxation law.</PARA></TALK.START></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TITLE>Interest Rates</TITLE>
<QUESTION PAGE="3519" SPEAKER="Coonan, Sen Helen" NAMEID="2M6" ELECTORATE="NSW" PARTY="LP" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2M6">Senator COONAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate and relates to the budget. Over the last few days housing affordability results and figures from the Federal Office of Small Business have shown how home buyers and small business are benefiting from lower interest rates. The government's budget aims to increase national savings and cut Labor's legacy of debt to take pressure off interest rates and to help all these groups and encourage growth. Despite this, Labor is proposing to sabotage the plans to reduce the debt it created&mdash;more than $7 billion. What will be the consequences if its proposals succeed?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="3519" SPEAKER="Hill, Sen Robert" NAMEID="BH4" ELECTORATE="SA" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Environment" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the question from the honourable senator because it's more good news for Australia, and a further demonstration of good government in effect. Yesterday, the Real Estate Institute of Australia released figures showing that Australians on average are now spending 28 per cent of their <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> household income on home loan repayments compared with 30 per cent this time last year. Furthermore, last week's housing finance figures showed that the number of new loans approved in July leapt by 16 per cent. So housing affordability has improved and the home loan take&hyphen;up rate has increased. Australian home owners and would&hyphen;be home owners are benefiting under a lower interest rate policy. That is the first point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point is that having reduced interest rates is good for small business and small business will also applaud the policies of this government. The Federal Office of Small Business reported on Friday that small businesses across the nation are expected to save around $110 million through cuts in variable interest rates alone. Madam President, you and all honourable senators would know that nothing is more important to small business than keeping interest rates low. It provides the capacity to grow, make profit and employ more Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind honourable senators that the first official reduction in interest rates in three years came after this government got into office and the trends are therefore positive. The trends are positive because we are the first government that has been prepared to take hold of public expenditure, reduce it and take pressure off interest rates. Therefore, small business and home owners can be confident about the future. It is interesting to see that today's ABARE report picks up the same sentiment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What about low inflation?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Listen to this, Senator Sherry. ABARE said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The prospect of further reductions in Australian interest rates in the short term has improved given the outlook for continued low inflation and fiscal tightening announced in the 1996-97 budget.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, giving the Australian government, the coalition government, full credit for the improvement that is occurring and further improvement that is likely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that these benefits are not put in jeopardy in this Senate by the opposition parties in this place voting down significant parts of the budget and therefore undoing <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3520"> the good work that is being done by this government. I simply draw the opposition's attention to the sentiments of people such as Ian Salmon of the Business Council of Australia who said, `You can be pretty sure that if the savings side of the budget does not get up, that's going to put pressure on interest rates.' In other words, if you vote down our budget, that puts pressure on interest rates to go up. The same sentiment was expressed by the National Farmers Federation; not surprisingly by the Real Estate Institute; and also the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the trend is in the right direction. It is important that that trend continues. But it will only continue if the opposition parties in this place also recognise their responsibility and support the budget and the fiscal tightening that we have put in place.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AX5">Senator CHRIS EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Family Services. Minister, I refer you to the recent decision by President Clinton to approve Food and Drug Administration laws, declaring that nicotine and tobacco is a drug subject to federal legislation. Why has the federal government not followed the US lead and lifted the schedule 7 exemption on nicotine and tobacco? Is it the case that the government has no intention of acting on this matter, as was claimed by a government source quoted in the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>  on 26 August this year?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9X5">Senator ELLISON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Communications and the Arts. Does the minister believe that a partially privatised Telstra will be more efficient because it will be less subject to political interference? Is there any prospect of bipartisanship on this important issue?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="3520" SPEAKER="Alston, Sen Richard" NAMEID="LD4" ELECTORATE="VIC" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Communications and the Arts" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a very important question because Telstra is currently subject to the risk of political interference. If you look at the current provisions of the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Telecommunications Act there is a power for ministerial direction and, of course, that can be used and abused in a variety of ways. There were two high watermarks of political interference. One was a few years ago when it was necessary for Telstra to have all its press releases approved by the office of the minister for communications. But even in more sinister fashion was the other occasion back before the May 1995 budget when you had Mr Keating essentially stockwhipping Mr Blount into handing over a special dividend of an extra $100 million a year for two years on top of their ordinary dividend, together with the early repayment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the risk of political interference is a very serious one. The proper approach to take is to ensure that you have transparent rules by which all carriers must play. I think that is a widely accepted rationale for privatisation but I did not realise quite how widely accepted it was until I read the transcript of the Townsville hearings of the Senate Telstra inquiry. Senators will remember there were only two witnesses interviewed there and that it cost about $25,000 to go there, which is about $3.34 per second.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most interesting exchange on that day came from none other than Senator Kim Il&hyphen;Carr who made a very valid point&mdash;and I would be surprised if Senator Kernot would regard him as part of the Telstra privatisation cheer squad. It is quite clear from the evidence of that committee that Senator Carr has taken my advice and has made that to phone call to Fidel because what he said was this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Would it not be the case in a privatised or partially privatised or more commercially focused operation that there would be less political interference and therefore would it not be the case that it would be a more efficient organisation?</PARA>
<PARA>I could not have said it better myself. Senator Carr is absolutely right. There is no doubt that his Damascus conversion is very welcome on this issue. He is quite right: in a partially privatised Telstra there will be less political interference; it will be a more efficient operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just to make matters worse for him&mdash;if in fact he did not quite mean to put it in those terms&mdash;is the answer he got from Mike <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3521"> Reynolds. I know why you do not want to hear this one, Senator Carr, because Mike Reynolds was a former Labor mayor of Townsville. What did Mike Reynolds have to say? He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have no doubt that with a privatised or partly privatised organisation we would have less political interference in that particular way . . . </PARA>
<PARA>There you have it. You have someone that I would be surprised would be accused of being ideological on this particular issue, who has finally seen the light. He is obviously sick and tired of the dirty deals that go on behind the back of the Sydney Town Hall. He does not like the arm twisting and the thuggery that goes on in the factional game.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Carr has finally realised that you ought to allow businesses such as Telstra to operate commercially, not to have that political interference and to be as efficient as possible. He knows the benefits of efficiency, and I am delighted to welcome him aboard the cart. I think he deserves the commendation of the Senate for the approach that he has taken. I just hope that he will have more success in caucus, that he will be able to demonstrate the hypocrisy of the stance that his own party has taken and that he will take the opportunity to explain to Mr Beazley and Senator Schacht just precisely why this is the sensible approach to take. I very much welcome his conversion on a very important issue.</PARA></ANSWER>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9X5">Senator ELLISON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. Does the minister believe that there is indication of further scope for bipartisan support for the important policy objective of the part privatisation of Telstra, given the compelling arguments in favour of privatisation made by the Leader of the Opposition in a speech to the National Press Club on 24 August 1994?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="3521" SPEAKER="Alston, Sen Richard" NAMEID="LD4" ELECTORATE="VIC" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Communications and the Arts" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is when it really does start to hurt because we are talking about someone who ought to be in a position of responsibility. We know why Senator Carr is not on the front bench, but the reason that Mr Beazley is presumably there is so that he can demonstrate some leadership on the important issues facing this country. What did Mr <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Beazley say when he was actually a minister? He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The primary objective driving the privatisation program is to make Australia an efficient internationally competitive economy. . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The focus of debate on efficiency measures such as privatisation and competition policy is often on job losses, but it is more important to realise that the efficiency gained from the pursuit of competition creates jobs.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Privatisation fits in with the government's broader imperative to create jobs.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, this is not an ideological argument; this ought to be an argument about how you can act in the best interests of consumers and Australian citizens. That is why it is desperately disappointing that someone like Mr Beazley should not now have the courage to express those same convictions in the way that he did only 12 months ago. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have said it all along&mdash;and I continue to say it: we are about choice for families.</PARA>
<PARA>Do you recall, on the same program, Professor Peter MacDonald, of the Research School of Social Science at the ANU, saying that the budget `says to people&mdash;well, if you have children, then perhaps you shouldn't be working' and Professor Bettina Cass saying, `The bias against dual income families exists by making it more uncomfortable and difficult for parents to juggle work and family, and more costly for parents to juggle work and family'? Can you explain why there is such a stark difference between what you claim and what the experts say, namely, that the budget in fact reduces choice for women and families?</PARA></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="3521" SPEAKER="Newman, Sen Jocelyn" NAMEID="BE4" ELECTORATE="TAS" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Social Security" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very interested that the senator has raised this question. She might be interested to know that the interview I gave for that 15 second grab was about 20 minutes in length, highlighting the difficulty that one has when trying to get a message <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3522"> across when a program perhaps has another line which they are wanting to run.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, I was very keen to get on the public record what choice for families really means from this government. It means the opportunity to choose whether one parent, not necessarily the mother, is at home when the children are very small, if the family chooses to do that. It means choice as to whether they provide child care themselves, whether they provide it through the informal sector, whether they provide it through family day care, whether they need out of school hours care or holiday care, or whether they choose to go down what has been the high cost option of the publicly funded community child&hyphen;care area. In all these areas, we are giving families choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I notice that the opposition is only prepared to have a slash and burn where there are people on higher incomes who are being affected by the government's actions. We have made it very clear that battlers are the ones who deserve the greatest attention, support and sympathy from the government. It is battling families that were our prime targets for assistance through our family tax initiatives, which were not just for families where a parent stayed at home, but also where there was any dependent child. So in a very real sense, we were looking after families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were looking after people with work and family responsibilities through the industrial relations reforms which will give greater opportunity for flexibility of hours, which will give greater opportunities for permanent part&hyphen;time work, which many of the unionists on the other side of the chamber would have spent some of their years making more difficult for women. Women trade unionists have told me over and over again of the lack of sympathy they have encountered in trying to make arrangements for more flexible working arrangements to deal with family responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Through the retirement savings account, we have recognised that women will be in the work force as well as at home. What is not acknowledged by programs such as the one which the question was about is that women at different times of their lives have different <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> needs. They may be young married women in relationships where there are two incomes; they may choose to stay at home for a little while when their children are babies and then they may be a one income family. They may go back into part&hyphen;time work and then they are a one and a half income family. Later on, when the children are older, they will very likely go back into the full&hyphen;time work force and be a two income family again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is up to the families to choose. It is not up to government to choose. We have been putting in place measures that make that real life cycle easier to manage. So we are not judgmental about whichever choice people make. We are trying to make it a fairer choice. Under the previous government we do not believe that the choice was as fair as it should have been.</PARA></ANSWER>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8U4">Senator LEES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Family Services. The cuts in the budget for public hospital funding, some $312 million across all states, are apparently there because the states have been cost shifting. Could you please explain what has been happening with regard to cost shifting? What <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3523"> have the states been doing? Which states have been doing what? How are you going to spread those $312 million in cuts over four years across the states? Finally, given the enormous problems facing our public hospital system, is your government prepared to reconsider this move and, in particular, are you prepared to consider allocating the one per cent increase in the Medicare levy for high income earners directly into the public hospital system?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam President, I am not certain that the brief which I have from the Minister for Health and Family Services addresses the specifics of the question. For the specifics that I do not address in the course of the brief, I will come back to the senator later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The brief provided by the minister for health says that under current arrangements it is the state and territory governments which determine the total amount of funds available to the pubic hospital system, the budgets for individual hospitals and the arrangements&mdash;for example, casemix&mdash;under which they are paid, the number and the location of hospitals, and the range of services available at each hospital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As you would realise, the Commonwealth makes a substantial contribution through hospital funding grants to the states and also contributes indirectly through financial assistance grants. Under the current funding arrangements, the total Commonwealth HFGs to the states rose from $3,080 million in 1988&hyphen;89 to $3,933 million in 1992&hyphen;93. That is an average increase of three per cent in real terms over that five&hyphen;year period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1992 Medicare agreements resulted in an additional $2 billion from the Commonwealth for hospitals. The 1996&hyphen;97 budget estimate for Commonwealth payments to the states under the Medicare agreements is $4,796.5 million, an increase of $67.2 million, or 1.4 per cent on the 1995&hyphen;96 expenditure. That increase reflects underlying growth of 3.6 per cent for price or population indexation offset by cost shifting adjustment and other factors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the 1996&hyphen;97 budget context, the government tackled the longstanding problem of cost <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> shifting by the states and territories to the Commonwealth. The $75 million cost shifting adjustment in 1996&hyphen;97 reflects the failure of states to comply with an agreement by health ministers back in June last year to desist from further cost shifting. Whilst grants have been reduced, expenditure by hospitals is also reduced as costs have been transferred to the Commonwealth medical benefits schedule.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In contrast with the trend in Commonwealth hospital funding, states funding to the public hospital system has not shown steady growth. An analysis of the data compiled by the Commonwealth Grants Commission shows that the states' contribution to hospital funding declined by about two per cent in real terms over the period 1989&hyphen;90 to 1994&hyphen;95, which are the most recent years for which data is available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1996&hyphen;97, New South Wales will receive an estimated $1.535 billion in HFGs from the Commonwealth, which is an increase of $23.8 million on the 1995&hyphen;96 outcome and maintains funding in real terms. As I said to Senator Lees before, I will get further particulars relating directly to the details of her question.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the budget, Madam President, we have announced a package that sees total Commonwealth government support for research and development in 1996&hyphen;97 exceeding $3&half; billion to increase the effectiveness of the government's research and development contribution. It is focussing the assistance towards increased outlays on research and development and away from tax expenditures or tax concessions. That is a way which has been followed by many other countries in recent years, and I thought the opposition side of politics was similar.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The R&amp;D tax concession is being retained but the government has decided to reduce the premium rate for deductions for R&amp;D expenses to a maximum of 125 per cent. But that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> concession remains very highly concessional. It allows immediate deduction or rapid amortisation of expenditures which would otherwise be undeductible or amortised over a longer period. It remains generous compared with other countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As part of the government's package we have announced a new and additional support for R&amp;D, establishing the START program, which is an anagram for strategic assistance for research and development. That START program provides a flexible package of assistance totalling $340 million over the next four years. It is being targeted to encourage large projects containing highly innovative, technically risky R&amp;D that has strong support for commercialisation from the private sector. That START program will deliver more effective government assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government, I repeat, maintains massive support for R&amp;D, largely through the universities. The election commitment to increase CSIRO's funding base by an additional $115 million over the next four years has been honoured. Funding for CSIRO alone is estimated to be $440 million in 1996&hyphen;97, rising to $509 million in 1999&hyphen;2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam President, the government's record is well and truly on the line on this issue. We are a great supporter of R&amp;D. The package that we have produced in this budget will produce great benefits for the economy. That is on top of the economic policy measures that we have put in place to get interest rates down, to get business growing and to encourage further growth in the economy which will lead to further private sector as well as public sector research and development.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an attempt by some people to create the impression that full fee&hyphen;paying places is about reducing the number of Commonwealth&hyphen;funded places and, equally, to say that it is about reserving 25 per cent of those places for the so&hyphen;called rich. These assertions are completely false. A fee place at a university will be over and above, not instead of, Commonwealth&hyphen;funded places. Next year the government aims to provide 358,000 undergraduate places at Australian universities. We aim to have 6,000 more undergraduate places than the number of places provided this year. In 1998 we want the number of undergraduate places to rise to 364,000. So it is certainly our intention to not only maintain the number of undergraduate places but to increase it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Abetz, you do put your finger on the problem with the future of Australia. We have an opposition, which used to be the government, which was the government for the yuppies and the top end of town. What we now have is an opposition that is for the well&hyphen;to&hyphen;do in Australia and with a total lack of regard for the battlers. Why have they got a total lack of regard for the battlers? I think Mike Steketee put it pretty accurately after the last election when he pointed out that Labor's vote dropped dramatically among households with incomes less than $20,000 while it did not fall much at all among the households with incomes of $50,000 to $60,000. That is why the battlers have abandoned you&mdash;and there was a very good cause for it. Why do you think the battlers found very great value in the proposals that we made at the election for family tax initiatives, for health rebates, et cetera? I could go on and on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What happens when the government brings down its budget? We hear day after day in here about how the opposition does not like this measure, is going to block that measure, is going to shuffle it off to a committee here and delay it. We have seen that happening with the superannuation charge on high income earners from Senator Sherry. We are seeing the same sort of opposition from the Labor Party over superannuation being included in the assets test for those who are over 55. Of course, the situation is that that is something which the Labor Party had, but they changed their minds and in 1993 left the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3530"> door wide open for the rorters and those financial planners who wanted to encourage people on high incomes to be able to retire earlier and attract entitlements from the social security system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The respected financial adviser Daryl Dixon said only last Sunday about the current system that the losers have been the ordinary taxpayers subsidising welfare payments to people with substantial assets. That is what we have attempted to deal with in this budget. We have tried to make a complex social security system simpler and easier to understand, but we have tried to deal with the unfairnesses in the system whereby the battlers have been paying for people who could and should be expected, first of all, to draw on their own resources&mdash;that is, people who are unemployed and have substantial resources, people who have superannuation and are facing early retirement who should be providing income from those rollover funds, and the elderly who have received compensation payments at law late in life. We are expecting them to make better provision for themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, equally, in the area of Dr Wooldridge's portfolio of health, we expect those who are well&hyphen;to&hyphen;do to put more into their own health care protection than they were under Labor. Why? Because the previous government was dead set on supporting the big end of town. The then Prime Minister, Mr Keating, did not have health insurance, nor did some of his rich mates. Poor former Senator Graham Richardson had great trouble trying to do something fair on health care. Recently, he wrote in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Parer), to a question without notice asked by Senator Woodley today, relating to the importation of cooked chicken meat.</PARA>
<PARA>I wonder if we may not have to rename some of these chicken diseases because they seem to be infecting the government. Perhaps it is mad chook disease, and that is where the problem lies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to underline the fact that the government is confused about this issue, although I ought not perhaps be too hard on Senator Parer because he is trying to give answers for a minister who himself is confused so it must be very difficult to do that. The problem is that the minister seems to be having a bob not just two ways but every way possible. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> yesterday, despite the fact that the minister has instigated two inquiries himself&mdash;we have had the NAIRN inquiry and also a Senate inquiry&mdash;the minister seems to be pre-empting those inquiries, that is, if the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> is correct. Perhaps the minister, or someone on the government side, might like to tell us whether or not the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> has reported the minister correctly. Yesterday the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government recently agreed to allow imports of cooked chicken meat in to Australia, and also faces pressure&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I wonder whether the Tasmanian senators are listening to this&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to allow imports of apples and fresh salmon as part of the move to freer international trade . . . Mr Anderson said a more accommodating approach to imports did not mean a relaxation of quarantine standards . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I wish the minister had been at the various Senate hearings we have had where I have become totally convinced that we certainly will be putting not only our chicken meat industry at risk but also significant numbers and species of our Australian native birds at risk. It is quite clear that the assessment done by AQIS is based on wrong suppositions and bad science and in fact misinterprets the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> results of the only tests done, which were done in Great Britain, in its own study.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite clear that our own industry is at great risk from these imports both from an environmental point of view and from an economic point of view. That is why it is essential that the minister does authorise an environmental impact study before any decision is made. But, if the minister representing the minister for primary industries is confused, I understand that because the minister for primary industries seems himself to be very confused. One day he is supporting an inquiry; the next day he is telling us he has already made the decision. So somewhere along the line somebody had better either correct the minister or correct the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper so that the rest of us actually know what is going on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just to put the record straight: in a letter dated 28 August 1996 from the minister to Mrs Marven of the Australian Chicken Meat Federation, the minister quite clearly indicates that he will not be proceeding with an EIS. More confusion, more problems for our own industry and more decisions that seem to be taken in a vacuum. I trust that, in my taking note of this answer, the Senate will also note the problems in this area and the confusion of the government and will press for the minister to do what he actually promised during the election campaign to do.</PARA></SPEECH>

All that is being worked out now are the protocols. The decision is taken. John Anderson says, `Competition policy; you've got to wear it. Competition policy is a good thing.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From the evidence that we received in Maitland last Friday, they have every reason to be concerned about this issue. They have to have a strategy to make sure that they utilise every means possible to bring their concerns to the attention of all of the appropriate authorities, inquiries and whatever else may be happening.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am used to the health side of these issues and, if the Therapeutic Goods Authority or any of the other health people were going to bring drugs into this country, you can rest assured that they would certainly want more evidence placed before them than just the results of work that has been done with egg yolk medium. They would also want further trials done on the actual diseases and the different types of virus that are associated with Newcastle disease.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron), to a question without notice asked by Senator Bob Collins today, relating to funding for the Community Development Employment Projects program of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission.</PARA>
<PARA>I bring to the Senate's attention the fact that in the area of the community development employment program, the CDEP, this government will be spending $337 million more in our first four years than Labor did in its last four years. If Senator Bob Collins is trying to say that this government is attacking the employment and training opportunities of Aboriginal people, then he had better think again. He had better have a good look at the budget because, in relation to education and training accounts, we have around $344 which will be spent in 1996&hyphen;97, with a total of $1.3 billion over the next four years&mdash;a real increase of 12 per cent compared to the last four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are four major programs which will be affected. The largest is Abstudy, essentially the equivalent of Austudy, which provides financial support to secondary and tertiary indigenous students&mdash;and that will allow $542 million over the next four years in the form of living allowances, assistance with fees and other educational expenses. There is the Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program, AESIP, which provides funding of $419 million over four years to educational institutions to improve opportunities and outcomes for indigenous students. This also includes additional funding of $143 million before the efficiency dividend over the four years from 1995&hyphen;96 provided in response to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a 1994 review of the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy, which found that indigenous people are the most educationally disadvantaged group in Australia. We have real programs with real increases in expenditure that deal with the training of Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have the Aboriginal direct assistance program, which provides educational support such as homework centres or tutorial assistance. For this program, $233 million will be provided over the next four years. ATSIC's major program is the community development employment project, with funding of $353 million in 1996&hyphen;97. There are currently 262 communities involved in such projects, with a total of approximately 28,000 participants. CDEP participant numbers have been quarantined in the budget, so no CDEP jobs are at risk and no current projects are in jeopardy as a result of budget decisions. Additionally, current and future allocations provide some capacity for natural growth of around 50 new participants per month.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If Senator Collins is trying to say that there has been a cut in funding, a cut in the government's assistance towards Aboriginal training and employment, then he is mistaken. And he is not only mistaken; he is misleading the Senate in saying so because those figures are from the budget announced in August this year. This government is totally committed to the training of young Aboriginal people; it is totally committed to providing maximum employment for Aboriginal people. In fact, our policy of reducing the budget deficit is in turn going to offer more job opportunities to Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3537"> With the native title committee I visited a training facility not far from the Marandoo mine site where Hammersley Iron was providing on the job training for Aboriginal people. That training program was indeed successful, and plant operators from the program were then eligible to go on and gain employment with annual earnings of somewhere between $35,000 and $50,000 a year. That was brought about by economic growth from the development of a new mine. That is what this government is going to do: it is going to create an economic climate where all Austral ians will benefit, where all Australians will have more employment opportunities. But in the meantime we have that increased expenditure. For Senator Collins to say that we are cutting back on that is just not right and he ought to have another look at those budget figures.</PARA>

Senator, I would point out to you that over the last few years there have been various reports tabled in the Senate, one of them by the Senate foreign affairs committee <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in 1996, which talk about the human rights problem in Tibet. The human rights report by the joint foreign affairs and defence committee in November 1994 also has comments about human rights abuses in Tibet. I want to draw attention to two reports which I am proud of and which I was involved in. One of them concerns the delegation I led to Tibet and China in 1991, which was an all&hyphen;party report. I want to quote paragraph 18, page 32, from that report of the delegation. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Delegation was struck by the overwhelming support it encountered for the Dalai Lama. This appeared to be pervasive in Lhasa and its environs, at least. Every temple boasted a host of photographs of the Dalai Lama (far exceeding those of the Panchen Lama); special quarters, impeccably maintained, were set aside for him in monasteries; at every turn, people of all ages, both ordained and laity, would request, almost beg for, photos of him. The public display of this support, and Chinese tolerance of that display, greatly surprised the Delegation.</PARA>
<PARA>Apparently, since then the government has cracked down on photographs of the Dalai Lama. I would also point out that in the first human rights report, tabled in this parliament in December 1992, the recommendation unanimously supported by that all&hyphen;party committee said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Committee believes that the Australian Government should continue to press for the Chinese Government:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. to respect the human rights of the Tibetan people, particularly those rights set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which China has signed and the International Convention for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and the International Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhumane or Degrading Treatment or Punishment to which China is a party; and</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was unanimous. All these reports are unanimous.

The sentences for this group are harsh, ranging from one year to life. Twenty&hyphen;eight percent were for terms of over five years. The information persuades this Committee of widespread injustice being perpetrated in Tibet by the Chinese authorities.</PARA>
