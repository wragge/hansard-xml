<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister has already made it very clear&mdash;prior to the election when addressing ACOSS late last year and again when being interviewed by Clive Robertson on radio&mdash;as to our commitments to the disadvantaged and to pensioners and others in Australia. I have made it clear, too. Nevertheless, I have said that we have inherited a system which is complex, unwieldy, and difficult to administer, and which causes mistakes to be made by departmental officers. It means that a lot of people do not know what they are entitled to. After 13 years of adhockery by the previous government it is time that these things be given a good look.

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GX5">Senator TROETH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Assistant Treasurer. After 18 consecutive quarters of economic growth why has Commonwealth debt increased by 400 per cent in four years to over $80 billion, why are national savings rates at lower rates than at the depths of the 1982&hyphen;83 recession and why are Australians faced with an $8 billion black hole in the budget?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="319" SPEAKER="Short, Sen Jim" NAMEID="DJ4" ELECTORATE="VIC" PARTY="LP" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Troeth for that very important question. The results of Labor's fiscal mismanagement are totally evident from the very disturbing figures that she has outlined. What those figures show is the inability of the former Labor government to effectively manage the finances of this country, to manage fiscal policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let there be no doubt that the primary reason that we have a problem with our Commonwealth debt, that our national savings rates are at almost the lowest record in our history and that, with our current budget outlook, we are staring in the face of an $8 billion deficit, is the former Labor government's appalling record of fiscal ineptitude. Not only did Labor fail to save, they were massive dissavers. What is worse, they did not even recognise the problem they were creating. That is still the case. As recently as two days ago, Mr Beazley, at the Victorian state conference, said, `. . . this $8bn suggestion . . . It is a deceit . . . plain and simple, a deceit.' Further, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This $8bn black hole is a chimera, put up for political purposes, a con job by Mr Costello.</PARA>
<PARA>On top of that, Mr Beazley has also been quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This notion of an $8 billion hole is largely a fraud . . . there are no statistics produced by Treasury <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that indicated that there was that dimension of a hole.</PARA>
<PARA>Nothing could be further from the truth. Mr Beazley is the one being deceitful. He and his Labor Party have a history of deceit. If Labor was not even willing to take the Australian public into their trust regarding the dire state of their budget, it is hard to believe that they would have done anything at all to tackle it. They would not have even taken the first honest step towards bringing the budget back into the black. Randall Markey of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>  was told by the opposition leader, Mr Beazley, that he&mdash;Mr Beazley&mdash;would not have released Treasury's revised figures if Labor had won. The Labor Party cannot hide from this.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a lot of people out there who are listening to this. The Labor Party cannot hide from these figures, nor should they be allowed to. They should be required to hang every one of those $8 billion around their collective necks. Labor has to recognise and acknowledge that the coalition is simply fixing up the disastrous problems inherited from Labor. Labor had many opportunities during the election campaign to let the Australian people know about this appalling state of the budget deficit, but they chose the path of deceit. That is highlighted by Mr Beazley's statement on 1 February. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are operating in surplus and our projections are surpluses for the future.</PARA>
<PARA>He knew full well they were operating in deficit and their figures for the future were for a deficit as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week during an MPI Senator Sherry said in this place that pursuit of a budget surplus is an ideological pursuit. That highlights not only that Labor does not address the fiscal hole which is their own creation; they continue to act irresponsibly and treat it irresponsibly and ideologically. It has to be always kept in mind that it was the Labor mind&hyphen;set that led to five consecutive underlying budget deficits. That attitude has led to a 400 per cent increase in Commonwealth debt.

He is not a federal minister, but never mind. Do you agree with the statement that you want to continue to practise?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for the Environment.

Can the minister explain how the government's environmental package will tackle this vitally important issue and explain how that package will be funded?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator O'Chee for his important question. I inform the Senate that since European settlement Australia has lost much of its native vegetation cover. I mentioned at the weekend that some 15 billion trees have been  removed from the Murray-Darling Basin alone, which has resulted in severe erosion, rising ground waters and a massive loss of biodiversity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is experiencing land degradation and biodiversity loss that significantly threatens our environment and the productive capacity of our agricultural land. The loss of vegetation is contributing to the degradation <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of our river systems and is putting at risk many of our native plant and animal species.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is estimated that over 50 per cent of Australia's productive land now is in need of some form of repair. The direct annual cost of soil and water degradation alone is in excess of $1.4 billion. In addition the large-scale removal of native vegetation has disrupted the ground water balance, resulting in watertables rising across vast areas of Australia. This in turn leads to rising salinity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">About a third of Victoria's irrigation area has been salinised. Dry land agriculture has increased salt loads and concentrations in many rivers in south-east and south-west Australia. About one&hyphen;quarter of the cleared land in south-west Western Australia will become salinised over the next few decades and dry land salinity will also expand in the eastern uplands of Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I could go on, but what I am doing is setting out the basis of a matter of great national consequence and a matter that simply was neglected by the last Labor government of this country. The program that we put down in our election commitment included $318 million towards a national vegetation initiative. Funding of the national vegetation initiative will be used to rehabilitate degraded land, strategically reduce watertables and hence lower salinity levels, protect and improve water quality, rehabilitate our coastal zone, protect biodiversity and prevent further loss of species, develop a strong and sustainable forest industry and provide sinks for greenhouse gases. It is therefore not surprising that it is overwhelmingly supported by both farmer organisations and conservation organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How will we fund it? How are we able to fund it in a way that the Labor Party was not? Of course, through the sale of one&hyphen;third of Telstra. That will enable us to set up a $1 billion natural heritage trust&mdash;a capital fund to be reinvested in another major capital asset of Australia: its environmental wellbeing. Of that $1 billion fund, $318 million will go to this national vegetation initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What a matter of great regret, what a national catastrophe, if the minority parties in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="322"> this place join with the Labor Party, that so lost its morale and suffered disappointment as a result of the election, and this opportunity is lost&mdash;the opportunity to redress this damage to Australia's land, the salinity problems across southern Australia. That opportunity will be lost because you will not let us in this place set up that fund and reinvest part of the capital asset of one asset of Australia in another capital asset: the Australian natural environment.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Minister for Communications and the Arts. Minister, you constantly imply that Telstra is inefficient.

What do you say, then, about last week's BZW Australia study of Telstra, which predicts that Telstra's profitability will rise by 65 per cent over the next three years and that this rise is linked to sound management?

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I did hear Mr Blount on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS> . It was quite clear that what he was talking about was that the board's and senior management's commitment to efficiencies in the company was unrelated to the government's own agenda of privatisation. He has made it clear on a number of occasions that he is not wanting to take sides on the issue. He accepts the ruling of the government of the day. He was making it crystal clear&mdash;and I would have thought that you would have noticed this by now&mdash;that even Telstra itself acknowledges that it has to achieve a 30 per cent reduction in unit costs over the next two years because it is highly inefficient.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a very simplistic and essentially nonsensical response to say that, because you will increase your revenue, you must be efficient. They are totally unrelated. If you have a monopoly control of a market, you can charge what you like. That is what we have seen with ISDN pricing. What you need is competition combined with privatisation. The great virtue of privatisation, as those on that side well know because they have been down this path on a number of occasions, is that there is virtually nothing left in the cupboard when it comes to privatisation. The reason you did it and the reason we want to do it is that it forces efficiencies on the company. In other words, at the moment there is simply no accountability. You have heard me say this before: if you have lines per employee of 140 and the comparison with the American Bell operating company is 280 to 300 and New Zealand close to 300&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not stupid, Bob. Perhaps you ought to have a good look at US West, which covers 14 states of the United States, has very similar geographic dispersity and population density and is much more efficient than Telstra. Telstra knows that. Their operating cost per employee, their lines per employee, their revenue per employee are well off the mark&mdash;30 per cent below OECD standards in a number of instances. If you do not believe in productivity and efficiency, then you simply do not believe in lower telephone charges and you do not believe in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> higher quality of service. That is why it was very silly of Senator Bourne to somehow suggest the other day that, because the Netherlands and Belgium have temporarily overtaken Australia on the NUS survey as having the highest local call charges in the world, that is some sort of vindication of current policies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that Telstra itself acknowledges it has to lift its game. It is going to be exposed to much greater competition in the very near future with Optus coming into the local calls market. It is going to have full and open competition from 1 July next year and it will mean that a lot of very heavy hitters will be coming into this business. When you have standards of inefficiency that bedevil Telstra at the present time, it is going to make it very difficult for them to compete. That BZW survey, which estimated Telstra's value at $27.6 billion, is obviously proceeding on a number of assumptions, all of which, of course, depend crucially upon Telstra delivering the goods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think you would find that BZW assumes that Telstra will in fact achieve its 30 per cent reduction in unit costs over the next two years. It is a big ask. They have not been able to do that in recent times. As you would know, their work force went from 66,000 to 73,000 in the last financial year and, since January this year, another 3,500 to 4,000. You simply cannot achieve productivity on that basis when all the other telcos in the Western world have been reducing staff levels, sometimes in the order of 10 to 15 per cent, even though they might have started privatisation a decade ago. You can bury your heads in the sand on this. If you want a second class outfit, you are going the right way about it. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></ANSWER>

The Japanese had proposed to increase the annual catch, in fact, by 6,000 tonnes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia did not support this proposal, neither did New Zealand.

Under the powers of the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill 1996 presented last week, carriers have a means of escape from the universal service obligations if those obligations are deemed to be inefficient or uneconomic.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I saw the release from the Leader of the Australian Democrats last Thursday, I could not believe my eyes. We were told that the Democrats were proposing to release a leaflet to all householders&mdash;which, presumably, would be at taxpayers' expense&mdash;and that they had not yet received a copy of the bill. In other words, they had made up their mind to go out <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and tell the Australian public what was wrong with this bill before they had read it. What the leaflet said was this, amongst other things:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Would you trust a private company to provide a guaranteed level of access to all Australians if it affected their profits?</PARA>
<PARA>That deals with the universal service obligation. Clearly it was written before you had seen the bill, so there you were trotting out a blind prejudice. You well know that it is not simply a matter of leaving it to a private company to do the right thing. The legislation very specifically requires it, and we said that in our pre-election commitments. We have said it ever since. You ought to have known that from the outset.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What Senator Woodley also ought to know, if he had read the legislation, is that in section 287 of the Telecommunications Act there is a very specific outlining of the universal service obligation. The act goes on to spell out the formula that is required to fund that through the universal service levy. What the bill does is reaffirm that commitment but, at the same time, it leaves in the existing Telecommunications Act the requirement for the universal service obligation to be implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In other words, there can be no possible way in which you can water that down. You would need to change two acts of parliament. I presume you are not about to do that. I find it extraordinary. I do not know whether you have been having too many dinners with Senator Kim Carr or whether you are simply getting your advice from the mad left of the union movement who are opposed to these sorts of things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What Senator Kernot also says in the press release she put out the following day&mdash;in other words, compounding the felony&mdash;is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A ministerial declaration already sets out, as a condition of a telecommunications licence, the minimum response times on the provision of services.</PARA>
<PARA>The fact is that all that is required under a ministerial direction is for Telstra to provide information or status reports on the extent to which they are complying or measuring up with certain standards that they, themselves, set in their corporate plan.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="331">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In other words, there is no ministerial direction requiring a minimum standard. That is why we are putting it in legislation. The only place you would find a minimum requirement on the part of Telstra is on page 14 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">White Pages</EMPHASIS>, and we do not regard that as good enough. That is why we want to legislate. The universal service obligation is absolutely essential to this legislation. It is provided for in spades. We have reaffirmed an existing legislative requirement. In other words, it is in there twice&mdash;and you have the cheek to get out there and mislead the Australian public, play to the fear and ignorance, in other words, the lowest common denominator party. Why don't you rename your slogan `Lowering the standards'? You obviously are not interested in ensuring that the public knows what it is all about.</PARA>

They have never had public ownership of telecommunications carriers. Senator Woodley's ideological preferences are clearly showing when he thinks that any dilution of government ownership constitutes a destruction of government ownership. It certainly constitutes a watering down, but it does it very much in the public interest. That is why you have a legislative regime. You simply do not leave it to the market or to the company.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;There were some informal discussions off chamber, outside the chamber, towards the end of last week. You may recall, Mr President, that I made the suggestion during some debates in here on sessional orders that the appropriate course of action in terms of dealing with a raft of proposed sessional orders and other procedural matters, including the allocation of questions for question time, was for them to be dealt with around the table with all senators, all parties, represented. That suggestion, when I made it, was roundly condemned by Senator Hill and Senator Kemp as unworkable. Needless to say, even though it has not been reported back in this chamber, it took place. I was pleased to say that the government listened to the advice I gave at that time and we did have towards the end of last week a constructive discussion about these matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr President, the opposition for its part made very clear that we believed that not only should the issue of proposed sessional orders for the Senate be discussed, but an important aspect of the Senate procedures, namely the allocation of questions in question time, also should be subject to the same process of informal discussion. Senator Hill, in my view correctly, on advice took a decision to convene an informal meeting. We did have a long discussion about sessional orders. The issue of question time allocation was also raised. Where this issue was left, Mr President, was that Senator Hill indicated to me at that meeting, to Senator Carr as Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate and to Senator Ray, the other member of the Procedure Committee who attended this meeting, that we would have further informal discussion on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The principle, as I understand it, Mr President, is that until those negotiations, those discussions, were concluded all parties in the chamber&mdash;not only the government and the opposition but also the Australian Democrats and the Greens&mdash;agreed that we would operate under the existing arrangements for the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> allocation of questions during question time.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron), to a question without notice asked by Senator Bob Collins today, relating to ministerial guidelines and Senator Herron practising as a surgeon.</PARA>
<PARA>The reason I asked Senator Herron the question I did today was to draw attention to two things, but in particular the guide that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) issued on ministerial responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just to respond to Senator Herron's interjections, it was not the opposition that put up <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="334"> this particular proposition. It was the Prime Minister, with a great deal of chest thumping and spotlights, who put this out as the new government that was going to sweep clean with a new broom and have this super&hyphen;duper set of guidelines for their ministers, parliamentary secretaries and so on to adhere to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You are not the only one with problems, Senator Herron, which is what I wanted the opportunity of pointing out today. The Prime Minister has to concede either these ministerial guidelines that he put out with great pomp and circumstance are unworkable, or he has to have a number of ministers make some, to quote the Prime Minister, `significant personal sacrifices'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, Senator Herron has not bothered to read these guidelines or if he has he has not understood them because there is nothing in here about profit or loss. In the preamble it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Along with the privilege of serving as a minister . . . there is some personal sacrifice in terms of the time and energy&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>not money&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that must be devoted to official duties . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The guidelines go on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ministers . . . must not engage in any professional practice or in the daily work of any business.</PARA>
<PARA>It cannot be much more explicit than that.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator BOB COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have read the lot of it, Senator, but you have not bothered to. There is one paragraph that intrigues me and it is also very explicit. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ministers are required to divest themselves of all shares and similar interests in any company or business involved in the area of their portfolio responsibilities. The transfer of interests to a family member or to a nominee or trust is not an acceptable form of divestment.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the blind trust arrangement that Malcolm Fraser operated when he was Prime Minister is no longer suitable for these squeaky cleaners. Where does this explicit paragraph leave the federal Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson)? I would say that, referring to the Prime Minister's guidelines, it means his having to either resign as a minister or make a very <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> considerable personal sacrifice in selling his considerable primary industry interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will specifically indicate why this is a problem. It is a problem because the primary industry minister made a controversial ministerial decision a couple of weeks ago that potentially affects his bank balances. That was the decision he made to revoke, to the great chagrin of the beef industry in Australia, the trials that were set up under the previous government relating to the importation of grain.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is he a grain grower?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator BOB COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He certainly is a grain grower and a significant one. They are going to not only suspend the trials but also explicitly rule out having any future trials. Why is this a problem? I will tell you why. At the height of the drought and when domestic grain supplies were absolutely at crisis point the price went through the roof, putting a lot of lot feeders out of business. The price went beyond $300 a tonne. It was exacerbated by the fact that a lot of grain growers around Australia, not unreasonably, were withdrawing grain because it was going up at the rate of $10 and $20 a tonne per week. Senator Crane and Senator Panizza know this. It went right through the roof. You cannot blame the grain growers for doing that when they were in difficult circumstances, but that is what was happening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a demonstrable fact that, within two weeks of the then government announcing that it was going for the first time in Australian history to permit the importation of the grain, the price went down. Tens of dollars got washed off that price within a fortnight. That was measured by ABARE. I am happy to table the graphs that ABARE produced demonstrating this fact. That was the very reason the government announced this measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What Mr Anderson has done, at the behest of his fellow grain growers&mdash;and this has caused a great public outcry among the very valuable lot feeding industry in Australia&mdash;is not only close down the trial and withdraw <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="335"> the Commonwealth support that the former government provided but also announce, to my astonishment, that he is not going to allow any future trials. He has stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He ruled out any new trials suggesting that live stock feeders . . . during any future domestic shortage.</PARA>
<PARA>I am not suggesting for one minute that Mr Anderson has deliberately done that in order to increase the price he might get for his grain, but the fact is that it will have that effect. As the former primary industry minister, I often reflected and discussed with my staff how Mr Anderson, as a minister and with his significant holdings in primary industry, would have handled a number of submissions that I took into cabinet because they would have directly affected his income as a producer. There is no question that making it difficult to import grain is going to improve his bank balance. He has to resign as a minister, sell his farm or change the guidelines. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Collins would not be aware that the only holiday I have had since coming into parliament was my two months in Rwanda. I enjoyed working there. I regard surgery as a hobby. There are no funds. I am happy to see patients on a Sunday afternoon if that is what you require of me. I have been operating on <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Saturdays and Sundays and seeing patients on Saturdays and Sundays. That is the love that I have for my profession.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of day, I am not taking a stand in this regard particularly for myself. In essence surgery is a skill that requires re&hyphen;accreditation every year. The Royal Australasian College of Surgeons requires its members to be re&hyphen;accredited every year. You have to fulfil those re&hyphen;accreditation requirements to be able to operate.

<TIME.STAMP>(3.24 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have heard, both in question time and just now, Senator Herron trying to explain the difference between his hobby&mdash;as he now calls it&mdash;and his job as a minister in the present government. Senator Herron has to be complimented on what he did when he was a backbencher in opposition. He used his medical skill to go to Rwanda and conduct services there for the Care organisation. We in the Australian Senate all complimented him for that humanitarian work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But let us be clear about the facts. He was a backbencher in opposition. He had no ministerial duties. He had no duties which involved making decisions about the expenditure of Australian taxpayers' money or decisions that would affect outcomes and incomes for various people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has to be recognised that Senator Herron is now a minister, one of the 26 ministers, yet he still wishes to conduct his profession&mdash;which he now calls a hobby&mdash;as a surgeon. Whichever way you look at it, some public money will be involved. In one form or another&mdash;either directly or indirectly&mdash;there is a fair chance that public moneys will be involved in the provision of the health services that Senator Herron is participating in as a surgeon. That is why the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), in the ministerial code of conduct, said that ministers must not engage in any professional practice or in the daily work of any business. That code is designed to overcome that specific conflict of interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not just that Senator Herron is conducting some other activity in the private sector. He is working in the medical profession, a profession which gets a substantial subsidy from the federal government&mdash;running into <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tens of billions of dollars&mdash;to provide health services in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I would have thought that, because Senator Herron then got up and said that this was really his hobby&mdash;and I do not know whether he charges his patients or not&mdash;he was, first of all denigrating, the profession of being a surgeon. I am not sure that, in the long run, some people in your own profession, Senator Herron, would like it to be described as a hobby.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fundamental issue, which Senator Herron does not seem to understand, is this: you have a clear conflict in your ministerial duties. You await Mr Howard's direction&mdash;and you said he has until 27 May&mdash;but that is an extraordinarily long time to allow this to take to be sorted out. Most people, when offered a position in the ministry, snapped at the opportunity in the first few days after the Prime Minister was sworn in&mdash;and I presume you were one of those people&mdash;and the Prime Minister was sworn in within the first 10 days of his party taking office. It does seem that it has taken a long time to sort out the very simple issue of a ministerial conflict of interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I find extraordinary is that Senator Herron cannot see the conflict of interest. This is astonishing. It is a very simple case; there are no ifs or buts. It is a very simple case spelt out in the Prime Minister's ministerial code of conduct. But Senator Herron cannot accept it and he has said that he will wait for the Prime Minister to tell him. Now he is saying, `If he tells me to give up my hobby&mdash;my surgeon's profession&mdash;I will give it up.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Herron, why do you wait for the Prime Minister when it is in the statement? It seems to me that Senator Herron's view about the conflict of interest probably goes back to the 17th or 18th century when these issues were debated at some length in the British parliament. These issues were sorted out 200 years ago.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise briefly to address the point that Senator Bob Collins made regarding the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson). I was hoping he would have stayed in the Senate for a moment while I spoke, and I signalled him to do that. Senator Collins said that John Anderson made a decision which could affect his own income. That decision was the one that banned any further imports of grain from the United States and other places. I presume that it was from the United States, because that was the case in point last year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Importing them tends to keep down the price of second&hyphen;hand and new machinery in Australia.

Hopefully, once he has seen that AQIS can look after the problem, he will take the ban off again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He also included second&hyphen;hand tractors from the United States. It is very easy to make sure a tractor is clean. If you include headers and tractors, I believe you have to go right across the board, maybe even to mining machinery. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> What I am saying is that Mr Anderson made a decision in that case which is against the interests of his own pocket. Senator Collins pointed out that Mr Anderson made a decision that improved his pocket. I am telling you an example, from the same article in the same newspaper, of Mr Anderson making a decision that went against his pocket. That is the whole point.

Not doing so has caused the problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can understand that Senator Herron, having spent a lifetime practising medicine&mdash;and, I believe, practising very well&mdash;does not want to surrender his skills.

With due respect to the government, members ought to see the Prime Minister fairly quickly and get him to set out better guidelines.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It seems to me that the great fault of Senator Herron is in the defence he has led rather than in what he intends to do. I do not think that anyone on this side of the chamber would be particularly critical of Senator Herron for wanting to keep his hand in and keep up his professional skills. He may not be here for ever. It is one of those occupations where people have to be re&hyphen;accredited every year. That should be acknowledged.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the problems is that it was not made clear in Senator Herron's interview on Sunday, or until his second contribution here today, whether this would be a supplement to his income. That is a separate and distinct issue. With respect to Senator Macdonald, it has nothing to do with whether we have a high regard for Senator Herron's medical skills. I do because I know people in Queensland who have attested to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a fact of politics these days, even if you are a humble number cruncher or trade union official&mdash;one of the lowest down the food chain, according to you people opposite: you arrogant, pompous glitterati who have had all these wonderful occupations over the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> years&mdash;I could go through the lot of you, if I wanted to. Leaving that aside, when you take on a ministerial job, you basically take on a full&hyphen;time job and you sacrifice everything else. That is part of it. The people I always feel sorry for are the parliamentary secretaries. They sacrifice everything and really do not get anything back. That is a matter that, because we could not resolve it in the last parliament, we will not let you resolve in this one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real problem for Senator Herron is an inept press conference followed by an inept defence today and a much better effort in the noting of questions. I will give you a little advice, if I may, Senator Herron: do not refer to surgery as a hobby. Referring to it as a hobby really puts the wrong gloss on it because most people who go under your knife do not want someone doing it as a hobby. They want what you are: a full and professional surgeon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The one thing you have to do, and you know you have to do it some time, is indicate in your defence whether or not you are being paid to do surgery. I am not talking about whether you are being paid in order to pay others to assist you. That is a separate issue. This is about whether you are deriving any pecuniary interest from it other than the justifiable one of being able to keep your hand in for the future. You should approach it in that way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not necessary to have in this chamber this sort of derogation of the occupations of people on this side as though somehow we are just so far down the food chain that the things that we have done in our life, that the things I have done in my life, such as working on a factory floor&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">STATEMENT OF REASONS FOR INTRODUCTION AND PASSAGE IN THE 1996 WINTER SITTINGS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the 1995 Winter Sittings, the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Act 1995 (Act No. 87 of l995)(the CELA Act) was passed by the Parliament. The CELA Act made substantial amendments to the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme to tighten the eligibility criteria for rebates of customs and excise duty paid on purchases of diesel fuel. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="343"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the course of the Senate debate on the CELA Act, 80 amendments were successfully moved to the CELA Bill as introduced. In the course of translating those amendments into a final Royal Assent Bill, several substantive problems with the commencement and the application and savings provisions were created which were acknowledged as contrary to the expressed intention of the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The application and savings provisions problems arose because modifications were not made to these provisions to take account of amendments made by the then Opposition and Greens, in particular relating to the law as it applied to quarrying and sand mining prior to 1 July 1995. Also, consequential amendments were not made to the commencement provisions even though it was agreed that particular amendments would commence at particular times. Several minor transcription errors in the CELA Act were also identified.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 29 August 1995, the then Government introduced the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995 (the Bill) into the Senate. The purpose of the Bill was to amend the CELA Act to correct the transcription errors the problems with the commencement and the applications and savings provisions. However, the Bill lapsed upon the prorogation of Parliament on 29 January 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need to correct the problems with the application provisions and restore the Senate's intention still exists, particularly in relation to the law applicable to mining for minerals. The CELA Act removed the eligibility for diesel fuel rebate used in the extraction of certain materials, including sand, with effect from 1 July 1995 only. Any existing rebate applications, or any matters before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) or the courts, that relate to the use of diesel fuel in mining operations prior to 1 July 1995 were intended to be decided in accordance with the law as it existed prior to 1 July 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The CELA Act as passed did not give effect to this intention and without the corrections to the CELA Act proposed in the Bill, these applications will be governed by the amended law. The effect of the Bill is to allow those companies which had lodged applications before 1 July 1995 to have them considered on the basis of the law as it existed prior to 1 July 1995, thereby restoring the original intention of the CELA Act. Should such applications be successful, in excess of S90 million in diesel fuel rebate would be payable and there are approximately 300 such applications awaiting determination in the AAT.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The applications before the AAT and the courts are currently listed for hearing in the next four months. It is for this reason that the corrections proposed by the Bill have an urgent commencement. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last Wednesday the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill was introduced into the Senate. After the bill was introduced, questions were raised as to whether the bill contained an appropriation provision and was therefore inappropriate for introduction to the Senate. The provision in question proposed the insertion of a new section 45 into the Therapeutic Goods Act. This provision would have established the therapeutic goods administration reserve and would have provided for the transfer of funds to the reserve from the consolidated revenue fund.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The appropriation affecting this transfer is found in the Financial Management and Accountability Bill, which is due to be introduced later this sittings. Advisers to the other chamber believe that the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill should itself be treated as an appropriation of the consolidated revenue fund. Whilst not accepting this argument, but rather to be seen to be demonstrating caution, the government has decided to avoid any argument and debate about the status of the bill introduced last Wednesday by withdrawing that bill and introducing another version of the bill not containing proposed section 45.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the provision will not be needed until the  Financial Management and Accountability Bill is passed, there are no plans to add the provision into the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill during its consideration by the House of Representatives.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to amend the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Act 1995 (Act No. 87 of 1995) (the CELA Act).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The CELA Act made substantial amendments to the Customs Act 1901 and the Excise Act 1901 relating to the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme, to tighten the eligibility criteria for rebates of customs and excise duty paid on purchases of diesel fuel.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the course of the Senate debate on the CELA Act on 29 and 30 June 1995, 80 amendments were successfully moved to the CELA Bill as introduced. In the course of translating those amendments into a final Royal Assent bill, several substantive problems with the commencement and the application and savings provisions were created which were acknowledged as contrary to the expressed intention of the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The application and savings provisions problems arose because modifications were not made to these provisions to take account of amendments made by the then Opposition and Greens, in particular relating to the law as it applied to quarrying and sand mining prior to 1 July 1995. Also, consequential amendments were not made to the commencement provisions even though it was agreed that particular amendments would commence at particular times. Several minor transcription errors in the CELA Act were also identified.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 29 August 1995, the then government introduced the Customs and Excise Legislation Amend <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> ment Bill (No. 2) 1995 into the Senate. The purpose of that bill was to amend the CELA Act to correct the transcription errors and the problems with the commencement and the application and savings provisions. However, the bill lapsed upon the prorogation of Parliament on 29 January 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the exception of one minor addition which I will discuss shortly, this bill is in substantially the same form as the 29 August 1995 bill and is being pursued because the need to correct the problems with the application provisions and restore the Senate's intention still exists, particularly in relation to the law applicable to mining for minerals. The CELA Act amended the definition of minerals by excluding certain materials, with effect from 1 July 1995 only. Any existing rebate applications, or any matters before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) or the courts, that relate to the use of diesel fuel in mining operations prior to 1 July 1995 were intended to be decided in accordance with the law as it existed prior to 1 July 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The CELA Act as passed did not give effect to this intention and without the corrections to the CELA Act proposed in this bill, these applications will be governed by the amended law. The principal effect of the bill is to allow those companies which had lodged applications before 1 July 1995 to have them considered on the basis of the law as it existed prior to 1 July 1995, thereby restoring the original intention of the CELA Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Introduction and passage of this bill will make those essential technical amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also makes one minor addition to the CELA Act to restore Diesel Fuel Rebate eligibility for the extraction of limestone for use in the de&hyphen;acidification of soil in agriculture, post 1 July 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">FINANCIAL IMPACT STATEMENT</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The technical "correction" amendments proposed in this bill have no additional financial impact to the CELA Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment in this bill concerning the restoration of Diesel Fuel Rebate eligibility for the extraction of limestone for use in soil de&hyphen;acidification in agriculture is expected to involve an additional cost to revenue of about $620,000 a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of this bill be adjourned until the first day of sitting in the spring sittings, in accordance with the order agreed to on 29 November 1994.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This particular bill, the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill 1996, is a consolidated version of the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill 1995 which was introduced by the Labor government in 1995 during the life of the last parliament. It incorporates a number of amendments that, as the previous environment minister, I moved on behalf of the then government on 30 November last year. I can say&mdash;and this probably will not come as a great surprise to you, Mr Acting Deputy President&mdash;that the opposition is going to support this bill.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The major reason for amending the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1989 was and is still our much needed requirement to remedy the discrepancy between Australia's international obligations and our domestic legislation. The principle act's definition of `hazardous waste' does not cover material sent for recovery operations&mdash;that is, for reclamation of metals or recovery of other useful materials. The Basel convention was drafted to cover both kinds of processes&mdash;that is, both final disposal and recovery operations. Both kinds of processes are included in the convention definitions under the single term `disposal'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also provides for the establishment of a technical group of scientific and technical experts to advise the minister on what is and is not a hazardous waste under the bill's definition. The technical group will provide the government with the capability of issuing clear guidance on definitional issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think one of the strengths of the bill&mdash;and I did refer to this at some length when I introduced this bill during the life of the last parliament&mdash;was the fact that its development depended on an extensive consultation process that involved a whole range of interest groups and that was indeed, I think, a very useful exercise. I also think it has meant that the bill itself has been widely supported. I refer Senator Hill particularly to the outstanding second reading speech that I made at great length in 1995 on this particular matter. I think it probably does not behove me well&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Chamarette would certainly like to speak to this bill, but currently she is fogbound on her way into Canberra. As a result, I will speak on this issue concerning an area with which Senator Chamarette and her staff have been concerned over the last several months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill 1996 involves the important updating of the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1989 in line with the most recent amendments to the Basel convention on the control of the trans&hyphen;boundary movements of hazardous wastes and their disposal. This bill fails to do that in a number of crucial respects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The global economy is rapidly increasing its consumption of the resources of the natural world. The mentality of consumption and the obsession with the new coupled with the highly synthetic basis of 20th century industry and lifestyle are creating enormous amounts <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of waste. Many of them are completely alien to the natural environment. Little is being done to find ecologically responsible methods of dealing with this waste.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to the United Nations environmental program report in 1990, 300 million to 400 million tonnes, or more, of hazardous waste are generated around the world, 98 per cent of them coming from the OECD countries of which Australia is a member. Currently some 200 million hectares of land per year are lost to agriculture due to toxification by this waste alone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In six out of 24 OECD countries there are 80,000 contaminated waste sites waiting to be cleaned up. Topsoil, which takes 12,000 years per inch to form, is dying under toxic water leaking from inappropriate waste facilities and leaching landfill. Areas carry more and more pollution from the vaporisation of toxic wastes. Rivers like the Rhine and the Mississippi and oceans and coasts are falling prey by the kilometre. The earth is a finite system. It is not producing convenient black holes for this waste to go into. We are rapidly being overrun by our own garbage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As hazardous waste production increases and effective methods of dealing with it do not correspondingly increase, the desire for countries to export it increases. If it is not possible to deal with it domestically, the most attractive response from mass consumption countries is to get it out of sight. In many cases this means ship it out of the country. The trade in hazardous waste has become a booming industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The United States Environmental Protection Agency recorded in 1988 that more than 2.2 million tonnes of toxic garbage crosses the world's borders each year as part of this trade. Between 1986 and 1988 more than 3 million tonnes of waste were shipped from the industrialised world to the non&hyphen;industrialised world. What the developed countries throw away in this manner is making the world sick. The developed countries do not have the right to blame this on developing countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="351"> Australia is by no means blameless. We are one of the seven biggest traders in toxic waste of all 24 OECD countries. What is worse, most of these imports are subject to no regu lation or record whatsoever. This is because they are under the guise of recycling. While they may be environmentally sensible on the surface, it is a manifestation of an attempt to use the community's desire for care of the environment to pull the wool over the rest of the community's eyes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's junk goes overseas to be processed in dangerous and poorly maintained factories to the detriment of the health of the local people. Companies in rich countries are allowed to get rid of highly hazardous waste by dumping it on poorer countries without strict environmental or health regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Basel convention was drawn up to address these problems. It deals with the international generation, management and disposal of hazardous waste and revolves around four central aims: firstly, that less hazardous waste be produced on a global level; secondly, that where the generation of hazardous or other waste is unavoidable that waste must be disposed of as close as possible to the source of the generation; thirdly, that hazardous waste may be exported when, and only when, the exporting state does not have the capacity to dispose of it in an environmentally sound manner; and fourthly, that exports should go only to countries that are going to deal with them in an environmentally safe manner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This cannot be guaranteed, for example, if the importing country is not a party to the convention. Such imports should be categorically prohibited. These intentions are not a matter of interpretation but are clearly stated in the act itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is very little in this bill requiring disposal of waste in Australia where we have the capacity to do so. With reference to the second aim of the convention&mdash;proximity of disposal&mdash;the act at present addresses this to a degree, but it is not enough. Legislative regulation to lower generation of waste is the most logical basis for an act dealing with hazardous waste, and yet this bill includes almost nothing on this topic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Government is able quite effectively to regulate generation through the Export Control Act. If an industry cannot obtain a permit to so easily export its waste it will inevitably <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> need to produce less. It will also be directed to deal with the processing of its own waste rather than dumping it on other countries. Hence both domestic processing and a proximity of disposal are dealt with together. As the government is not proposing to do this, we propose to include this requirement in the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is clearly an area where government is able to legislate to reflect the Basel convention. With this bill it has simply&mdash;as did the previous government&mdash;decided not to do so. The ban decision is quite obviously a reflection of the third stated aim of the convention: it is very important for human rights and environmental concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Importing waste is often a source of income for countries short&hyphen;changed by the global economic system. I might say that it is very short&hyphen;term income and the country is left with an unmanageable debt burden. The countries involved become dependent on a trade that is literally killing and maiming them. According to the World Bank, since 1984 the net transfers from industrialised to developing countries have been negative. The last thing the world&mdash;and particularly Australia&mdash;should be doing is legislating to send these countries our toxic waste as well. Perhaps we would benefit from the tragedy that most people in these countries are unaware that they are being bequeathed legacies that will kill and maim them. If they did know, I think that the outrage they would feel and express would strike home to us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With this bill Australia is exploiting the advantage we already have. To extend the interpretation to the extent that the substances can be classified as `not hazardous waste' is against the letter and the spirit of the convention. It is an extremely dangerous and foolhardy course for any government to take. This clause essentially means that hazardous waste can arrive at the doorstep of other countries, or even Australia, having circumvented the normal safety requirements. Recipients will simply not know what they are receiving.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is incomprehensible to the Greens (WA) how any government could have conceived of such a downright reckless strategy to enact its opposition to the ban decision. We advise the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="352"> government in the strongest possible terms to reconsider this clause. We know it was born of a previous government, but that does not mean that it should not be looked at very carefully.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A welcome change to this act in the bill is the alteration of the definition of waste to be in line with the definition used in the convention. The annual report for the operation of the hazardous waste act 1989 states that in 1993 no export permits were granted, yet Australia exported 20,000 kilograms of lead battery waste and a further 20,000 kilograms of waste aluminium cans to Hong Kong in this year. None of it was recorded because the current definition of waste is `anything that has been rejected as worthless by a person who has or had possession of it, whether or not someone else may regard it as having some value'. Goods intended to be recycled are excluded from control under the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The definition proposed by this bill is much tighter. Lead battery waste pollutes waterways and discharges lead battery ash into the air if processed in dangerous and poorly maintained incinerators. Many incinerators, especially those in poor countries, contain regressive, substandard technologies that cannot be relied on to dispose of toxic waste to safe levels. Even in the United States in 1994, all hazardous waste incinerators were found to be substandard to United States federal law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no requirement under this act that receiving governments ensure that human rights, health and the environment are taken into consideration in the development of science. When inhaled, lead based pollution has been known to permanently lower the IQs of children. Governments must endorse and legislate for the ban decision coupled with a change to the definition of waste to ensure the sealing of this loophole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I apologise on behalf of Senator Chamarette that she has not been able to participate in this debate so far, and I look forward to the minister's response to our concerns.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We did deal with this legislation last year and the Democrats will be dealing with it in much the same way this year with some additional amendments. I must say that I, too, am <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> entertained to see a change in the attitude of the previous opposition with regard to the urgency of this matter, but I agree that this is an important piece of legislation at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is and remains an international disgrace because it is not meeting its obligations under the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal. I would remind the Senate that the Basel convention was adopted in 1989 and Australia joined in early 1992. While there are over 60 signatories to the convention at the moment, there are some notable exceptions, for example, the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The convention has seen increasingly severe restrictions agreed to internationally to limit the trade in toxic wastes and, in particular, to try to prevent countries of the north, or the developed world, from dumping hazardous wastes on countries of the south, or the less developed world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1993 another convention banned the dumping of industrial and nuclear waste at sea. The International Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter&mdash;which is known as the London dumping convention&mdash;means that waste dumped at sea now has to be disposed of on land, meaning that poisons will be released onto the soil and into the land environment unless that waste is treated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am reminded particularly of the situation with jarosite dumping which continues to this day in Tasmania. I think that is due to a lack of zealous application and imagination by the previous government rather than practical possibilities, because I know that it is possible to do one of two things: either reorganise the method of production of zinc in Tasmania, because it is possible to produce zinc by other processes than the process which requires jarosite; or arrange for its disposal or at least storage on land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We could comply with the London dumping convention. We have chosen not to. For that we continue in disgrace, thumbing our noses at the requirements of the convention. That is the sort of thing that we continue to follow in our comfortable, First World, developed <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="353"> lifestyles. We retain the luxury of being allowed to protect parts of our environment and ignore other parts and choose to subscribe to conventions or choose not to. We have this luxury. We follow through the nimby type of approach at a national level because we are subjected to the fact that nobody in their right mind wants to have a cesspit or a toxic waste incinerator in their neighbourhood. It is easy for us to follow that at a national level. It becomes easier and cheaper for us to export the waste and to place it out of sight, out of mind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As stricter regulations have been applied to waste disposal, so the costs have risen and so the quantities and types of hazardous waste have risen. In the United States alone, the amount of hazardous wastes rose from nine million tonnes a year in the early 1970s to 240 million tonnes in 1990. We are still a society which creates exactly what we want and damn the consequences. We worry about them afterwards. In some cases we choose to allow other people to worry about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats maintain the concept that the focus must remain on waste prevention and minimisation, to cut down on the amount and the types of services required to deal with the waste. We do not accept that it is not possible to continue in the way that we are at the moment, where we continue to create greater and greater amounts of waste and to seek to make somebody else responsible. Operators and creators of waste who come to us say that the irresponsible operators get the subsidies to dump cheaply, which makes it unfair and expensive for those good operators who want to meet their community responsibilities. These trends have meant increasing pressure to export the waste. I will quote the coordinator of Greenpeace International's toxic trade prevention project, Mr Jim Pucket, who says that toxic waste, if left to the free market, will follow a path of least resistance. I say: what would you expect? With the decisions of economic rationalists being driven by market demands, of course that is what will happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Hazardous waste by-products go to the countries which are most vulnerable and which have the least economic ability to resist <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> them. Cash in return for dumping some slime in a back paddock is hard to refuse. One example is the government of Guinea Bissau, who took over 15 million tonnes of toxic waste for the payment of $600 million. They said they needed the money and that is no doubt the case, and who would refuse a deal that was four times the gross national product of the country?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since 1989&mdash;and remember that that is when the Basel Convention started&mdash;there have been over 500 attempts to export 200 million tonnes of waste from the 24 member countries of the OECD to 122 non-member countries of the OECD. The preferred countries to dump in are changing from Africa, the Pacific and Latin America. The shift is to Eastern and Central Europe, the Commonwealth of Independent States and Asia. In the negotiations to the Basel Convention the majority of countries wanted to ban trafficking in hazardous waste altogether. However, the proposal for a worldwide ban was vetoed, not surprisingly and very sadly, by the OECD countries which had the most to lose from such a ban.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I heard Senator Margetts mention, one of the most notable exports has been lead acid batteries under the guise of recycling, sounding very friendly by that description. The problems associated with this were first brought to light when workers in less developed countries were having problems with the effects of what was supposed to be recycling plants for lead acid batteries. It was highlighted that workers were not wearing safe clothing; they were getting acid burns and even becoming blind from unsafe work practices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1994 Australia was the main exporter of lead acid batteries to Indonesia. In 1992, in just one year, we exported over 11,000 tonnes of lead acid batteries compared with the United Kingdom's 700 tonnes in 1993. When a particular plant started near Jakarta, the villagers thought that it was for processing wood. However, it burned 60,000 tonnes of lead acid batteries a year, sending fumes and ash into the neighbouring rural area. The waste, which is a mixture of lead and plastic, is dumped outside the factory and is taken home by local people who melt it in woks in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="354"> their backyards to extract the lead, which they then sell.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We would know, but unfortunately they would not know, in advance and we would expect the result. The result is that villagers have very high blood lead levels and are coughing blood. We would have predicted that but we, in our comfort, export to their ignorance and exploit these people, calling it recycling and feeling good about it. This is the way that we are dealing with our waste. Everyone in this parliament&mdash;because remember, we are making the laws that allow this&mdash;is responsible for such decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats hope that this legislation will prevent these types of trade but we know that there are plenty of people, the sorts of shonks and brokers whom we would find in any place, who would like to get permits to take the waste off the conscience of the Australian government and then on-sell it. We hope that this will not happen. We will be watching carefully and listening to the aid groups who have been part of the discussions and the consultations to see what is happening to the waste that is exported under this amended act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am aware that the former government went through a two-year consultancy process with conservation and community groups and with industry. I think that process at least should be acknowledged as making an effort to follow in the right direction. Nevertheless, we still have some amendments to this legislation. The first two are to limit some rather wide-ranging powers of the minister and the last is to ensure that economic considerations are not placed ahead of safety because, as in the example I used, it is cheaper to export batteries to Indonesia but unconscionable and certainly not safe. It certainly requires further considerations other than economic ones. The constant theme of my argument in this whole area of legislation is that if we rely on the economic paradigm to determine what is appropriate behaviour then we will not necessarily end up in a socially equitable and just situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The Democrats will have the opportunity to move amendments. We will not accept replacing the word `safety' with the word `effici ently', because that would put at the highest level of decision making a judgment about the economic value of following certain actions. I will detail further amendments in the committee stage.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think Senator Faulkner is often ungracious but since he has moved to the other side of the chamber, he has become even less gracious, I have to say, if that is possible. I have had a chance to check the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  record to see whether, in fact, the opposition, as we then were, were obstructive on this bill. My reading of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  shows that, although people had concerns, we supported the bill. In order to speed the journey, I was able to incorporate at least half of the speech I proposed to make during the second reading debate, given the tightness of time, to see whether we could ensure that the bill got through on that day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whatever Senator Faulkner's arguments about previous occasions&mdash;and we can always debate those&mdash;on this particular bill there was an effort to assist the government to ensure that the bill was passed by the Senate. While some concerns were expressed in the chamber, they certainly did not relate to the opposition.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;In closing the debate, I thank honourable senators for their contributions. As Senator Kemp just said, the former opposition, the coalition, was in fact supportive of the Hazardous Waste (Regulation Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill and was supportive of its passage on the last day of sitting in the last session. But, unfortunately, we were not able to deal with it because we received notice of an intended long contribution from <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="355"> the Greens (WA), and the government had got itself into an awful mess in its program. In fact, many bills were not addressed by the Senate as a result of that problem and this was one of them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have, however, moved quickly upon coming to government to address the matter, because it does seem to us, as I said in my second reading speech, that Australia is presently in breach of the convention and it is important to bring our domestic law into order. In particular, it is important to deal with waste transported for the purposes of further handling in recycling or other than reaching a final repository.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said also, this bill had been the product of a contribution of both industry and conservation groups and it seemed to us a reasonable compromise had been reached after a long period of time. It was important that we recognise the effort that was made by industry and other groups to reach a satisfactory outcome, and therefore our desire to implement the provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank all senators who have contributed. Senator Margetts largely outlined the intended amendments that are going to be moved in the committee stage by Senator Chamarette. We have now had circulated the list of amendments from the Greens (WA). Senator Bell has indicated that he is planning to move some amendments, but we do not presently know what they are.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So everyone is in order and ready to get on with the committee stage but, unfortunately, Senator Chamarette is on an aeroplane. As we all know, this Senate cannot proceed without Senator Chamarette. She has sent the message through that she would be particularly grateful if she had the opportunity to contribute to the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> further debate of this bill and, because of her long interest in the matter, we have decided to meet her request. In a spirit of goodwill and trying to set the right atmosphere at the start of what is going to be a difficult session, we have decided that we should meet her request in a positive way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had a brief discussion with Senator Faulkner on behalf of the opposition on this matter. Therefore, after the passage of the second reading, I will seek to adjourn the debate until Senator Chamarette returns which, we hope, will only be a half an hour or so.

<STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to speak in the address-in-reply debate, I would like to join with the Governor&hyphen;General in his comments in relation to the Port Arthur massacre last week in Tasmania and, as a Western Australian senator send my sympathy and condolences to the families and friends of the victims of that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="356"> tragic incident. It is no secret that victims of that tragedy came from all over the country as well as overseas. Indeed, my state did not escape the tragedy. As Australians we bound together last week to show our solidarity of support for those people who suffered as a result of this incident.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the Senate adjourned on 1 December 1995, no-one quite foresaw the electoral result that occurred on 2 March this year. On 2 March this year Australian people made a significant decision. They decided to end 13 years of Labor rule and to endorse overwhelmingly the policies of the coalition. It was one of the largest margins given to a government in postwar Australia&mdash;that is, a margin in excess of 40 seats in the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition won the election on a sound platform which dealt with mainstream issues. Nowhere was this more evident than in my home state of Western Australia. The result in Western Australia reduced members of the opposition from six out of 14 seats to just three out of 14 seats. The coalition maintained a majority of eight seats, with the remaining three going to independents. In relation to the Senate vote, the coalition achieved 3 quotas, with that last quota going largely to the Democrats and resulting in the election of a Democrat senator.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to take this opportunity to welcome two new government members in Western Australia&mdash;Mr Don Randall in the seat of Swan, formerly Mr Beazley's seat, and Ricky Johnston, who defeated George Gear, a former minister, in the seat of Canning. I also take this opportunity to welcome Dr Alan Eggleston who will be joining this chamber on 1 July.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Overall, the vote in Western Australia increased from 54 per cent to 56 per cent. When you consider that Western Australia had one of the highest coalition votes in the 1993 election, it is quite astounding. This occurred despite the dire predictions of some as to the effect that the state government and its policy would have in Western Australia. In fact, the situation was the reverse. Much of what the federal government proposes to do has already been implemented by the coalition <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> state government in Western Australia&mdash;and I would submit has been implemented with a great deal of success.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of our key policy areas in the lead up to the last election related to the area of industrial relations. This policy was endorsed overwhelmingly throughout Australia, but nowhere more so than in Western Australia where similar policies have been in place for some time. Some of the practical reforms proposed by this government are on similar lines. They include the development of a more decentralised industrial relations arrangement and, furthermore, the encouragement of the proliferation of workplace bargaining. The voluntary membership of unions is also going to be pursued and secondary boycotts will be outlawed. All of these policies have found a place in Western Australia and have been implemented with success.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well as that we have seen with the state government in the west responsible financial management. I submit that at the federal election in March this year the coalition received the population's overwhelming endorsement for a responsible financial management policy. We have recently seen with the Western Australian state budget a reduction of net debt to the lowest level since June 1989. Western Australia has the lowest unemployment rate in this country, some 7.7 per cent, and, in particular, the lowest youth unemployment rate, 20.4 per cent compared with the national average of 27.8 per cent. Western Australia has one of highest growth rates in the country, all brought about by policies which are similar to those which this federal government intends to pursue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I am basically saying to the Senate is that the proof is in the pudding. I am referring only to my state of Western Australia. One need not go any further than Victoria to find a similar example. In Victoria, the Kennett government was returned with an overwhelming majority. This saw the endorsement of policies on similar lines to those proposed by the federal government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="357"> Like this federal government, the Western Australian government has targeted the training of youths. They will be trained with specialist skills so that they can find employ ment. Gone are the irrelevant programs which were designed to conceal unemployment figures. The growth of youth employment is an example of the practical policy that that state has pursued. It is no doubt the case that federally this will occur once this government has implemented similar policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Western Australia privatised the State Bank and that resulted in nearly a billion to pay off debts. I can say to this chamber that parallels can be found in relation to the privatisation of Telstra. As a result of the partial sale of Telstra it is intended that some $1 billion be paid towards an environmental debt. The environment is one of the greatest assets in this country. As with any asset, it needs investment and support. That will come from the partial sale of Telstra. That in turn will address the environmental debt that we face in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government faces a huge black hole, which has been referred to many times since the last election. It is a black hole to the extent of $8 billion. We heard the Governor&hyphen;General say that this government will embark on addressing that by cutting outlays by $4 billion in the approaching budget and then in the ensuing budget after that. That was a policy which was pursued by the governments of Victoria and Western Australia with great success. The people of Australia realise that the time has come for governments to act in a prudent fashion. We cannot afford to live beyond our means. We have to address the debt situation and we have to cut government outlays.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Native title is another area where, once again, the coalition's policies have been vindicated. At the very outset, the Western Australian government warned of the problems that would be faced with the Native Title Act. The government in Western Australia said that this Native Title Act would give nothing to indigenous people and would give nothing to the community at large. How right they are. The Premier of that state, Richard Court, was on his own and was ridiculed by the press across this country for the stand he took at the time. But has he not been proved right? It is now some two years later and there has not been one successful <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> claim for native title. We have seen competing claims from indigenous groups over various pieces of land; we have seen case after case bogged down in a system which is unwieldy and impractical.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government proposes amending the Native Title Act to make it workable for all concerned. That is an area where the people of Australia again spoke. They spoke through the ballot box. It was one of our key platforms. The people of Australia said, `We do not want the situation to continue. We want you as a responsible government to address this unworkable legislation.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Generally, the coalition made it quite clear in other areas that we would not rush headlong into a republic. In fact, we proposed a people's convention, which would be made up from a variety of representatives, both political and from the wider community. Territorial and state governments would be consulted. The people, I believe, spoke quite clearly on 3 March 1996 by electing the coalition on that policy. They did not want the headlong rush into an executive style republic based on what the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, wanted. The people of Australia wanted consultation. The people of Australia want to be consulted by this government as to any changes that are proposed in relation to the constitution which has served us so well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind the Senate that, when this constitution was drafted, it took some 10 years, involving various conventions across this country, before the document was finally settled. What we have is a situation where a former government capitalised on a feeling that there should be a change to the head of state for this country, and capitalised on it willy&hyphen; nilly without any reference whatsoever to what the people really thought. I put it to the Senate that we should say, `If the people want change, so be it.' But in ascertaining whether there should be change, there should be proper consultation. I believe that we do have an Australian head of state in the Governor&hyphen;General and that we have a system of government which is second to none. I remain unconvinced at this stage that any change is warranted. However, that is just my view. There are others who have competing views <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="358"> which are supported by sound argument. At the end of the day, we must embark upon a process where all can be heard and where the issues can be discussed and debated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also no secret that the coalition took a position on political correctness. `Political correctness' is a term which has been used to describe social engineering, the thought police and the trend to dictate what people can say and think in a political sense. We have seen it with a range of legislation introduced by the last government. Australians have always been a free people; they have always been individualistic and they have always had the desire to express their views without fear or favour. What we have seen in recent years is a growth of the feeling that, if you speak your mind, you automatically get labelled in some way. Political correctness was to be found in regulation. That is, we regulated people's thinking, we regulated people's behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Affirmative action was used in such a way. It is interesting to note that the opposition introduced a quota for women. It said that there would be a certain percentage of women in the opposition ranks and that this regulation would dictate to the members of that party in the selection of candidates. It is interesting to see that, at the last election, there was a dramatic increase of female representation in the House of Representatives. It did not come from the opposition; it came from the government. I might add that it came without any quota, it came without any regulation, because the approach from this side of the chamber was that you did not need to regulate people's thinking&mdash;you choose the best person for the job. And that is how it should be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that there are some refreshing changes in the wind for Australia. This is a government which will govern not only for the city but for the country as well. Regional Australia has a lot of disadvantage. I come from a resources based state where farming, mining, forestry and fishing are big income earners for this country. Invariably, the state of Western Australia produces no less than 25 per cent of this country's export income. That largely comes from regional Australia. So I welcomed the Governor&hyphen;General's comments <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in relation to the development of the rural enterprise network program and the rural development incentive program. I believe that, with these sorts of programs and the consultation that this government will embark on in regional Australia, we will address the issues and disadvantage suffered in the more remote areas of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the campaign I had the opportunity to travel to the far north of my state and there saw first&hyphen;hand the disadvantage that people have by way of the cost of living, the cost of freight and the fact that workers are flown in and flown out because employers do not want to provide a house or motor vehicle&mdash;there are fringe benefits tax implications. What that does is detract from the infrastructure of those mining and pastoral towns. In those areas you need more people for the infrastructure so you can have schools, hospitals and public facilities, which will encourage people to live and work in those areas. That is so important for this country, which has seen a centralisation of unprecedented proportions&mdash;by far the majority of our population live in five capital cities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe the government is on a solid course with its policies as outlined by the Governor&hyphen;General. Not only will it be a fiscally responsible government but such things as health, housing, income support and community services will be dealt with more fairly. The government has outlined its incentives for the states to deliver more palliative care. The government is committed to the establishment of a Commonwealth dental program and the government has made a commitment to meet by 2001 the full demand for work&hyphen;related child care. It is a government that will deal responsibly with taxpayers' funds and will see that the good management of such funding goes to help all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In last week's Newspoll we saw increased support for the government. This is despite the publicity given to the impending budget cuts. In my own state of Western Australia a recent Morgan poll put the government ahead on a two&hyphen;party preferred basis, 60 per cent versus 40 per cent. A more recent Westpoll showed that in Western Australia the government commanded 48 per cent of the vote as <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="359"> opposed to only 30 per cent for the ALP opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those figures come in the face of this government stating very clearly what it intends to do. Not only did the people of Australia give us a resounding endorsement on 2 March this year, but they continue to do so. Not only does this side of the chamber receive such support for its programs and policies in a federal sense, but it also does so on a state basis. To see this, one has only to look at the success of coalition governments among the state governments of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are on the right track. When this government faces the people in three years time in an election, it will be able to do so with a clear conscience and will be able to go back to the people of Australia and say, `We did what we set out to do and we have delivered to you a sound financial budget and a situation where Australia is a fairer country, where taxpayers' moneys have been managed on a more accountable basis and, above all, where you are a lot freer in what you can do, say and think.' If we achieve that in three years we will be doing very well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we in this chamber have to be allowed to do what we promised the Australian people we would do. That is something the opposition needs to remember if it&mdash;indeed, any minor party in this chamber&mdash;is to remain relevant. If it thought that the people of Australia were of the opinion that we would be elected in the lower house to do something and then have, in the Senate, a different result so that we could not do it, it would be on the wrong track, because the government is formed in the other place. That is where the people of Australia very clearly made their choice as to the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not the case that, by a majority not being delivered to the government in the Senate, the people said, `We want you to do one thing but we do not want you to do another.' That is certainly not the case. The people of Australia have seen fit to have a check and balance in this chamber but it is not one which is to obstruct the good government of this country.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking in the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> address&hyphen;in&hyphen;reply debate, I would like to address my remarks to the sale of Telstra. I know that at this stage we do not have the legislation before the Senate, although it has come before the lower house, but there are some things that can be said about this whole notion of the sale of Telstra without reference to the legislation&mdash;concerning general questions which arise from the whole process without regard to the specific legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to take the following viewpoint: many people on our side, and people in the minor parties, will argue about the whole principle of selling public assets but my concern is that even if you wanted to sell Telstra, even if you had decided you wanted to sell Telstra, you certainly would not do it now, under the market conditions that prevail at present.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of things have to be taken into account when looking at the sale of something as massive as Telstra. In terms of earnings, it is probably the biggest company in Australia. The first concern that I would have is that the government has not provided any of the industrial, regulatory framework which would exist once Telstra has been sold.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government provided quite extensive draft recommendations for the world post&hyphen;30 June 1997. That post&hyphen;1997 document was circulated extensively through the industry and attracted quite a bit of comment from various industry players. It provided an understanding of the structure under which the players would operate, and in particular it provided shareholders of Optus with a notion of what their company would be worth, because it explained very clearly what sorts of constraints would act upon that company in terms of it making a profit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the present government has not given any such undertaking that they will provide a regulatory framework. They have not given any undertakings to the Senate or to anyone else about what sort of world a privatised Telstra would exist in. The government seem hell&hyphen;bent upon providing the legislation to the Senate, as they have to the lower House, for the sale of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, when it comes to when they will tell us what the world will be like post&hyphen;July 1997, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="360"> all we are told by the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) is, according to his remarks to the ATUG conference last week, he will get a green paper together with all sorts of options for post&hyphen;1997 and it will be available in about a month; he will then get the different industry players together around a table to have a chat about it; and perhaps in September this year we might see some sort of draft legislation come before the Senate with a hope it might be enacted by the end of the year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But in the meantime the minister wants the Senate to approve the sale of Telstra. He has made that perfectly clear. So we are in a position where the Senate is really being asked to fly blind. We are being asked to approve the sale of Telstra, a massive public asset, without any indication at all from the government about what the industry framework will be past the middle of next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is absolutely crucial to consumers of telecommunications services in Australia because, as anyone can tell us, all of the benefits that consumers have enjoyed over the last few years have derived from the introduction of competition and the industry framework which the previous government put in place. None of these things were available when Telstra was a monopoly. In fact, the old Telecom was a very difficult organisation to deal with. It certainly was not consumer orientated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was the introduction of a viable competitor, being Optus, that really provided the lower charges and the better services that people have come to take for granted now. Prior to then, there was simply no need whatever for Telstra to provide any of these sorts of services and no real stimulus for them to do it. So the whole issue of industry structure is absolutely crucial to the world of a privatised Telstra, or indeed any other telecommunications company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has to be recognised too that we are in the very early stages of deregulation of the telecommunications market. I can quite confidently say that Optus would be very quickly gobbled up by a privatised Telstra. It is the case now that Optus, while it has now turned to making a small profit, certainly does <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not have the financial strength or the market strength that Telstra has. It was my view, certainly prior to the last election, that steps had to be taken to make sure that Optus was maintained as a viable competitor with Telstra, given that it was crucial to all of the consumer benefits which flowed from Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The position is that Telstra is now making more money as a competitor with Optus than it was as a monopolist. All of the money which it is making now derives from the fact that competition was introduced. But more important than that, for the purposes of this debate, is that Telstra is awash with cash. There is an argument that Telstra is in actual fact overcapitalised. Certainly a view of the previous government was that it was appropriate to raise the dividend and to improve the return to the shareholder of Telstra because so much cash was pouring into the organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is certainly not true of Optus. Optus is a new player. Optus, with a massive commitment in front of it to capital expenditure for cable roll out and the like, does not have the same sorts of cash revenues available to it as Telstra does. Because it cannot compete in the local call market, in the telephony market, it will be some time before it will have access to that sort of cash, whereas Telstra, on the other hand, is more than capable of funding all of its current capital expenditure requirements, quite considerable though they may be, from the amount of cash flowing into the organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there is no equality at all between Optus and Telstra, and there will be no equality between Optus and Telstra for some time to come. It is the regulatory framework which the previous government has set up and which this government will have to set up post&hyphen;1997 which will determine the balance between Optus and Telstra and therefore the sorts of consumer benefits which consumers are used to at present.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another consideration too when we look at the capital structure of the two companies. In selling Telstra, what the government is looking for is a greater commitment from the Australian capital markets than they have produced hereto. Generally speaking, the Australian stock market can provide about <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="361"> $12 billion to $15 billion per annum in new issues. Net of dividend reinvestment plans and all the rest, you can normally count on about $12 billion to $15 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year it was only $11 billion, so it cannot be assumed that it is always somewhere in that range. But let us, for the purposes of argument, say that the market can provide some $12 billion to $15 billion&mdash;and that, might I say, is without any restriction on foreign ownership. That is just the general take&hyphen;up of new issues. Yet we are being asked to believe that the Australian stock market can absorb in one hit some $8 billion in new issue from one company&mdash;not $12 billion to $15 billion across all companies, not $12 billion to $15 billion where they can spread their risk over the hundreds of companies which come to the market every year, but $8 billion by one company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an absolutely massive ask from the Australian stock market, and it is not one that you particularly want to do now. Might I emphasise that we are not talking about the normal conditions of a new issue, where really it is for all comers. We are talking about $8 billion where there are severe restrictions on foreign participation. So they are not getting the $8 billion from just the Australian stock market as they normally would but getting the overwhelming proportion of it from only domestic institutions. Of course, if it is only domestic institutions who are providing the funds, that will obviously drive the price down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the reasons why we brought forward the 1997 review was that the capital markets are there for not only Telstra; they are also there for Optus. You have to consider the fact that Optus will also be going to the stock market at the same time. There is a need at present for Optus to raise something like $300 million or $400 million from the same stock market. Rather than being in the position they were in under the post-1997 rules which the previous government provided&mdash;where they could go to the market, establish themselves as a viable competitor and get adequately funded&mdash;they now have to compete with the prospect of Telstra, or so this government would have us believe.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You are doing two things: you are getting less for Telstra than you otherwise would and you are making it more difficult for Optus to raise the capital which it badly needs. At the same time you are not providing any sort of regulative guarantees for shareholders as to how much money they can make, where the profitable areas of the company are going to be and what constraints there are on their profitability in terms of the industry framework.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, when you reflect upon the whole process of going to the markets you see that there is a fundamental conflict between the good of the consumer and the highest price you can get for Telstra. This is one of the things which the government has belatedly started to struggle with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has now said, `The community service obligation is going to provide for everything.' The community service obligation, which was enacted by the previous government, is now going to cover everything. The government has sought surreptitiously, in the bill it has presented to the lower House, to incorporate the community service obligation within the act. The problem with that is that you cannot cover everything.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Anybody who knows anything about accounting, particularly within an organisation the size of Telstra, knows that it is impossible to go to every single customer and work out what the degree of subsidy is for each individual customer. We introduced a process of calculating the CSO which was rough and ready; it served its purpose, but it would in no way satisfy a private shareholder.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me give you an indication of the sorts of numbers we are talking about. In my duty electorate of New England the degree of subsidy on a rough basis that Telstra has calculated and the figures it supplied to Austel were $1,940 per line per year in Armidale, $2,410 in Barraba, $2,300 in Glen Innes, $1,030 in Inverell and $780 in Tamworth. We are not talking about small amounts of money.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure it would be much greater in Darwin, and Darwin would probably be an easier place to service than all of the outlying areas in the Northern Territory. These are the difficulties involved in calculating a community service obligation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of things which cannot be calculated or presently are not calculated by community service obligation. For example, Telstra last year under the previous government introduced a number of TTY typewriters for the use of hearing&hyphen;impaired and dumb people. Those people were able to contact their loved ones, their relatives and so on by using public TTY facilities and TTY facilities in their own homes. Indeed, they could communicate with each other. Given the fact that they cannot use a telephone normally, it was obviously a considerable social benefit to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">None of that was calculated by the CSO and it is very difficult to calculate it in terms of the CSO. That is only one example of the number of things which are covered by a CSO which are not currently costed and which would be very difficult to cost. The present government suggests that the CSO is going to satisfy all of the requirements that we need, all of the things which consumers are concerned about under privatisation, but that clearly is not the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is this conflict between getting the best possible price for Telstra and serving the consumer. The interest of the private shareholders must be paramount to the directors of Telstra post-float. The interests of the private shareholders are integral to their directors' responsibilities. Even though we are talking about selling only a third of the company, even though we are not talking about selling the whole company, even if there is only a third of it owned by private shareholders, their interests have to be safeguarded by the directors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The directors have a primary responsibility, which is reflected in the Stock Exchange regulations and every other part of the ASC code, to look after the benefit of those shareholders. Their responsibility is to maximise the return to those private shareholders&mdash;not <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to the other shareholders; not to the government, which may be patient and which may have a concern, indeed an electoral concern, about the benefits which are flowing to the consumer. Their responsibility is to maximise the return to the private shareholders, to maximise the value to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In one respect, saying that we are going to do it only a little bit really makes no difference at all. Once you allow private shareholders into a company, as indeed the previous government found with the Commonwealth Bank, they become paramount. It is a furphy to suggest that somehow it still remains in public ownership and therefore all of the benefits which consumers are concerned about in regional areas in New South Wales and the Northern Territory are going to be protected. Really it is the interest of private shareholders that will become paramount once you get two private shareholders, let alone once you sell a third of the company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other consideration which has got absolutely no airing from this government at all is that they are asking the Australian stock market to buy Telstra when the Australian stock market, I am sad to say, has been a very poor performer. When I ceased working in the Australian stock market in February of 1994 the stock market was just over 2,300 on the all ordinaries; last Friday it was 2,299. There has been absolutely no movement in the Australian stock market since I left.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The suggestion that Senator O'Chee will put forward is that the stock market is going to improve. But, in order to be able to get more out of the Australian stock market than anybody has so far been able to get, we are going to have to get a better performance over the next few years than we have had over the last two. That is an extraordinary position for a government to put itself in&mdash;that it is going to make itself hostage to the Australian stock market to fulfil what is a very rigorous legislative program and to do it all in order to keep what it believes are its commitments prior to the next election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is absolutely no flexibility involved in the government's plans. You might mention Qantas, but the previous government twice withdrew Qantas from the market <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="363"> because of market conditions. There is no such flexibility allowed in the government's plans, absolutely no flexibility at all. They have to get this done with breakneck speed. I understand, from public statements which Senator Hill has made, that he wants this Senate to pass the legislation and is quite happy to maximise the pressure on this Senate and not wait for the new senators to take their place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no flexibility in their plans whatever in terms of market conditions. I must say, to be long in the market is a very uncomfortable position to be in. I have seen people who have exposed themselves to the stock market and it is not a pretty sight. The sight of Mr Costello, Senator Short or Mr Fahey kneeling beside their bed at night praying that the stock market is going to go up does not fill me with any great glee, although it may be so much the better for every other stockholder. But to say that they are going to do it and be exposed to the stock market to the degree of $8 billion is an absolutely massive ask. I have never seen anybody take an $8 billion punt on the Australian stock market. They will not just be sweating; they will be sweating blood.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other argument which is sometimes put up is that there is somehow some similarity between the sale of the Commonwealth Bank and the sale of Qantas. There is a fundamental difference between the sale of those other two entities and the sale of Telstra. If you were to equate the two positions, you would say that selling Telstra now is the same as selling the Commonwealth Bank in 1983, prior to all the deregulation of the financial markets, prior to any of the entry of foreign banks, prior to any floating of the Australian dollar and prior to all the changes which the Labor government brought in through the 1980s. That is the equivalent to selling Telstra now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth Bank, back in 1983, was one of only four banks in the country. It was very inefficient, even by its own admission. It was providing far less to its shareholder then than it subsequently did after the period of deregulation. It was also acting in a very immature market. We can, with the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> wisdom of hindsight, see just how immature the Australian financial market was back in 1983. All of the great changes which the Labor government brought in had yet to happen. That would have to be possibly the worst time you could ever envisage selling the Commonwealth Bank.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same thing is true with Qantas. Senator Bob Collins would be able to back me up when I say that all of the changes which the Labor government brought into the domestic airlines industry were massively to the benefit of Qantas. It became far more efficient, growth in the market was exceptional and it became far more profitable. You would not have wanted to try to sell Qantas back in 1983. Back in 1983, Qantas had a very poor record of profitability. It staggered from profit to loss, profit to loss. It was massively inefficient and therefore provided a very poor return to the shareholder. Anybody who suggested that selling Qantas back in 1983 was a good idea was clearly underselling the Australian public. That is exactly what the government is doing now by saying that it wants to sell Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the changes in telecommunications that are taking place around the world. To start talking about selling Telstra now, prior to all of those changes coming in, prior to there being any stable industry framework even being suggested by the government, is absolutely ludicrous. You are selling short the Australian people. There is no doubt that Telstra, when it is a mature player in a mature market with lots of other competitors, will be a far better prospect for sale sometime down the track than it is going to be now. That is essentially the difference between selling the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas and trying to sell Telstra now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People will argue the question about whether the government should sell public assets and all of the other considerations that go with that. The fact is that 60 per cent of Australians do not want the thing sold, but I am not making reference to those arguments. I am simply saying, by the government's own logic, if you wanted to sell this entity, you would not sell it now. You have to reflect <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="364"> upon what is rather unseemly haste on the part of the government. Why is it that they are so keen to get this sale through? Why is it that they want to bring this bill before the Senate, before there is even any suggestion about bringing any proposals to the Senate about the post&hyphen;1997 framework? Why do they want to get on with the job without any sort of framework at all for the sale?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One thing that occurred to me, and which I think should be in the back of every senator's mind, is the degree of pork barrelling which went into the last election. Certainly, we had Mr Sharp and Mr Costello, prior to the election, talking about what could be done with the proceeds of Telstra and the improvements to the highways of New South Wales, which is my state. I am keenly interested to know where the money for that is going to come from. But let us leave that aside. There is no link between Telstra and the environment. A number of speakers have now pointed that out, including Senator Kernot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is absolutely ridiculous to suggest that the plans the government wants to bring in have to be brought in by the sale of Telstra. If they had a real commitment to the environment, they would do it anyway. Certainly that was the policy which the Labor government put up to the last election, and it is one that can be enacted by anyone. The fact of the matter is that this government has no commitment to the environment at all because if they had they would not make it conditional. Commitment is something you make without making it conditional. This is the sore point. They know that it is conditional and they know the commitment is not there. All they are doing is looking for an excuse not to do anything about the environment. They want to put the onus not on themselves as a government, but on other senators, other political parties for funding the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have created this spurious $8 billion figure, which they cannot abide by in the next August budget, which was irrelevant when they first mentioned it in the Senate and which has been overtaken by further forecasting work by the Joint Economic Forecasting Group in April. This spurious number was never here for any other purpose than to bring <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> back Fightback. The motivation behind the sale of Telstra is exactly the same thing. There is no concern in here for the consumer, there is no concern in here for people in rural and regional New South Wales&mdash;my own state&mdash;and there is no concern to see those people do any better. We saw the minister make an absolute fool of himself today when he tried to explain why it was that selling down Telstra into private ownership in any way made it more inefficient, in any way provided any benefit to the consumer. Quite clearly, it does not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I indicated before, the sorts of things that the government seem to be relying upon in the legislation they have suggested to the lower house will in no way deliver the benefits that the consumer derives at the moment. The decision to sell Telstra at the present time is ill&hyphen;thought&hyphen;out, badly timed and the act of a very desperate government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All we can garner from the government's attempt to sell Telstra now is that everything the previous government said about the fiscal position is true: there is no money there and those opposite knew before the last election campaign that there was no money there. The present government went into that campaign knowing that if they were going to promise anything, given all of the other pork&hyphen;barrelling commitments they had made in Tasmania and northern New South Wales, they would have to hive off their environment policy and pay for it separately. It was the only way they could make ends meet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This decision has nothing to do with benefits for the consumer or for the rest of Australia; it is entirely to do with saving the government's fiscal skin and paying for the pork&hyphen;barrelling that they indulged in in the election campaign. To sell Telstra is the only way for them to do that. If they do it now they will get far less for it than they would if they waited until they had a mature industry with other competitive players. That was the example with the Commonwealth Bank, that was the example with Qantas&mdash;and this is exactly the same.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to remind senators, particularly opposition senators, of the pur <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="365"> pose of the address&hyphen;in&hyphen;reply debate. On 2 March the Australian people voted&mdash;comprehensively&mdash;to throw out those opposite. The people of Australia voiced their resentment of the former government's arrogance and excesses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My contribution today, therefore, will compare and contrast what has happened with what is planned for the future. As the Governor&hyphen;General said in his speech last Tuesday, in electing a coalition government the people endorsed decisively a comprehensive program of practical reform. The Liberal and National parties will keep faith with the people and implement that program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What disturbs me is that on virtually every single solitary day that has passed since 2 March we have heard Labor senators or members, Democrat senators, or in particular independent Green senators, talk about the legislation that they are going to block. Today we had a classic example. Senator Cook asked Minister Short whether the government would keep its promises. The simple answer is: we want to keep our promises. We want to be a totally different government from that which has ruled this country for the last 13 years. We want to be an honest government. The simple answer to Senator Cook and those opposite is that we will keep our promises as much as they will let us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have just heard a contribution from Senator Wheelwright on the sale of Telstra. Clearly, he and the Labor Party are opposed to the sale of Telstra. The Democrats are also opposed to the sale of Telstra; yet they had the gall, the cheek, the nerve, to reinvigorate their original slogan of `keeping the bastards honest'. How can anybody profess to have that slogan when part and parcel of their platform is to stop us from implementing an honest policy. It is absolutely and utterly absurd.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once again I highlight the difference between us and the former government. The policy for the sale of Telstra is a classic example to highlight that difference. We went to the public with the policy, opened up and said, `There it is.' The contrast with the Labor Party is that in election after election they promised not to sell Qantas and not to sell the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Commonwealth Bank&mdash;to name but two. They also went on to promise not to increase taxes and made other promises.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we all know what happened to Qantas. We all know what happened to the Commonwealth Bank. They were sold.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At least we had the honesty to say what we would do. We put our policies up front and the people voted for them. Yet we have virtually the entire opposite side of this chamber prepared to block that honest policy and proposal. In fact at question time today we had some dill ask us whether we were going to keep our promises. Really! You cannot have it both ways. The things that we have said we want to do were highlighted in the Governor&hyphen;General's speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> to boost the competitiveness and productivity of the Australian economy and thereby deliver higher economic growth and higher living standards;</PARA>

<PARA>A number of these things would not have been necessary if we had had a half&hyphen;decent government over the last 13 years. But that was not so. The reality is that we had a self&hyphen;indulgent government that thought more about itself and its mates than about anything to do with the Australian population.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us just look at the fact that Mr Keating decided that, while he was running ads and everything else to buy Australian, and everyone else in Australia was trying to do so, the leadership of the country, the Prime Minister of the country, saw fit to try to snaffle off into the Lodge a $30,000 teak table.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The leadership of this country in the indulgence stakes ensured that his home renovations went on to include a $261,000 carport. A carport worth $261,000 is worth twice as much as the average person's home. Then there was a $2,600 clothesline; $8,250 worth of antique lights. Nothing like going down to the lighting store and buying something nice that fits into the decor and everything else. But no, we have to go and spend $8,250&mdash;and, I might add, that was just for the dining room. Then there was a billiard table worth $14,300. It really does sound like a game on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sale of the Century</EMPHASIS>, doesn't it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem is that the money that was being spent was the taxpayers' money. But that did not matter; it still does not matter to this canary cage of people over on the other side. They do not understand that that is why they are sitting where they are today. People will not allow governments to indulge themselves in that way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But with the revamped Lodge with which the Prime Minister saw fit to indulge himself, he then decided to throw a few parties. The gabbling senators over on the other side were probably present at one of them because one of them was for 100 of his Labor mates. The cost of hiring marquees, crockery and cutlery for that party alone was $7,260.74. That was a party put on by the self-indulgent Prime Minister for his self-indulgent mates over here. That is unbelievable. But that is okay <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> because that is only the taxpayers' money. Of course, the ex-Prime Minister Bob Hawke had, I suspect, tendered his apologies to that party because he was probably too busy travelling around the country at the expense of the taxpayer: between his resignation and September 1994 he had already spent $34,023 on domestic air travel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How far do these lavish indulgences go? They were not allowed to continue because the people of Australia decided `enough was enough'&mdash;it sounds good enough to be a slogan. Not surprisingly, Mr Keating, when asked how much he had spent in total on such parties and activities, was tight-lipped. No wonder he called the taxpayers and everybody else scumbags; anyone who had a right or responsibility to ask him the difficult questions was just simply abused. Therein lies another reason for the Labor Party being thrown out: the people of Australia wanted a different administration; they wanted a different type of administration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All the while, of course, it should be remembered that Paul Keating was presiding over a government which was responsible for record youth unemployment, massive general unemployment, a record foreign debt, record bankruptcies, 16 consecutive quarters of debt in excess of $140 billion and a current account deficit of $27 billion. All the time that that was happening&mdash;the Prime Minister and his scallywags were all indulging themselves&mdash;a million people were unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We get on to areas of waste in various departments and agencies. We had a few questions last week and again today directed to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron). The thing that staggers me is that those on the opposition side have the gall and the nerve even to ask the questions in the first place. The reason for the problems with health, housing, education and living standards among the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities comes right back to point one: the Labor Party. Once again, while they were spending all their time indulging themselves, it was those very people who were suffering. Today, we are now being asked how we are going to correct the lack of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="367"> activity that has gone on for 13 years. That would be a fair question if it were coming from someone who was independent. But for it to come from the perpetrators of the excesses is a little over the top.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This ex-government, for example, gave a huge tick to the spending of $425,000 on a house on Thursday Island for an ATSIC commissioner; it came complete with white goods, carpet and bedding. The expenditure on this house alone instantly consumed one-fiftieth of the total Commonwealth allocation for Aboriginal housing programs in Australia. If I were someone from the Labor Party, that is not something that I would be particularly proud of. But this is the type of attitude they had.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consultancies were, of course, the flavour of the month&mdash;flavour of the month? Pardon the pun: they were the flavour of the month for 13 years. In the two financial years 1993-94 and 1994-95, the Labor Party spent taxpayers' money to the equivalent of $545,000 on public relations consultants for the Department of Veterans' Affairs and a further $40,000 on the dissemination of media statements on veterans' affairs; meanwhile, the department of tourism spent $300,000 on hiring two consultants to provide information on ecotourism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, the involvement of consultants in government departments increased 460 per cent between 1985 and 1995, with spending blowing out from $27 million to about $342 million. Before anyone says, `Well, so what! You are all as bad as each other', let me just explain the difference between what the Labor Party has done and what we have already put in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Junior ministers will have a $10,000 pay cut; a 20 per cent cut in the ministerial component of their salaries. That is the first thing. Ministerial appointments have been reduced from 30 to 28. Ministerial staffing levels have been reduced from 365 under Mr Keating's administration to 295, saving $5 million. The National Media Liaison Service and the Ministerial Media Group have been disbanded. Consultants have been reduced from 40 to one. There is the mark of a government that means business in terms of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cutting back on those excesses and saying, `We mean what we say and we say what we mean.' Therefore, we have a very different attitude.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As an example I will just take the National Media Liaison Service. The idea of a National Media Liaison Service sounds like a pretty good show to the average Joe Blow in the street. Basically, day in and day out we are still seeing questions generated by the remnants of the National Media Liaison Service. Ministers are being asked questions which are prefaced by the words, `On XYZ radio program you said ABCDE.' The questioners have not generated these questions themselves; the questions come from the remnants of the National Media Liaison Service which worked exclusively for the Labor Party and not in the interests of the community. That is where all this material is being generated. We have scrapped that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We could have kept that service and said, `Ah ha! What you did for 13 years to us we will now do to you.' No, we have taken the taxpayers' interest to heart and we have scrapped the whole shooting match. Of course, in the true blase spirit of Labor's accountability standards there is no comprehensive record available which would indicate the number of consultants who were employed or how much each was paid. Those things have also been kept secret.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to specific examples of waste in the day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day administration of some of the departments. The coalition is keen to start on counting forward, as the minister has said, but I am not going to deal with that. The Department of Social Security is often under the microscope for wastefulness. This is the department which is charged with the mandate of granting financial assistance to those who genuinely need help. The department should be most scrupulous as to how the money is spent. But, by way of specific example, last September the department spent about $2.5 million on a glossy promotional brochure called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Your family and you</EMPHASIS> which was mailed to 1.8 million Australian families. This followed the expenditure of $1.6 million on the promotion of the home child&hyphen;care allowance <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="368"> which was soon after scrapped and replaced by the parenting allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not for one moment suggest that the people from the department went to bed one night, dreamt this idea up, and went to work the next day and implemented it. This was all done at the instructions of an excessive Labor government which was desperate to be re&hyphen;elected and just dipped its hand into the taxpayers' pocket every time it wanted more money. The mere fact that we see $2.5 million spent on one brochure and $1.6 million on another is neither here nor there. It does not worry the Labor Party because it is not the Labor Party's money; it is the taxpayers' money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recall another example. In July last year the department erroneously paid out $100,000 in benefits. It had earlier incorrectly paid $4 million in benefits to pensioners and sent concession cards to 37,700 people who had no entitlement to them&mdash;including 12,600 people who had died.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wonder why a government would need to spend $4,995 on a single coffee machine for the branches of the Australian Taxation Office, and why the judges of the Family Court of Australia needed $10,000&hyphen;worth of Wedgwood china crockery. Why would a government need to spend $1 million to herald the arrival of a new polymer $20 note when the old one was going to be withdrawn and we had no choice whether to use the old or the new. This is simply a further example of how the former government decided to spend the taxpayers' money. It is a further example of why that government was comprehensively thrown out of office on 2 March.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wonder whether taxpayers had an obligation to foot the massive legal bill of Dr Carmen Lawrence. The people decided that they did not have a responsibility to foot her legal bill. The people threw out the government that sanctioned that payment. Dr Lawrence had no right to that money&mdash;none whatsoever. The royal commission last year had nothing to do with Dr Lawrence's status as health minister in the previous government; it had everything to do with her not telling the truth while she was Premier of Western Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And subsequently, as Senator Vanstone quite rightly says. Dr Lawrence compounded the problem by going on to deny that there was a problem. Of course, she received a blank cheque for her legal expenses. By contrast, only 1.9 per cent of legal aid users are ever funded for costs in excess of $10,000. Contrast that with the case of Dr Lawrence&mdash;`Blank cheque; whatever you want, you've got it.' Most legal aid claimants received less than $1,500 worth of legal assistance. I doubt that any of them had a salary of $130,000 per annum such as Dr Lawrence received when her legal costs soared to about $800,000. That is not a bad contrast with what the average taxpayer gets for their dollar. Compare that with what the self-indulgent former health minister, Dr Lawrence, got on her income.</PARA></TALK.START>

At least Prime Minister Howard is now taking the responsibility to sanction all ministerial travel. This government will just not write out a blank cheque and dish out as many airline tickets as it likes. That is what has happened for 13 years. It is not going to happen any longer.</PARA>

Mr Acting Deputy Presi <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="369"> dent, I have deliberately gone through some of those excesses. I would love to have a couple of hours to go through the rest of them, but I think it is very important&mdash;as I said at the beginning of my speech&mdash;to compare and contrast exactly what we are doing. We recognise the job of work that we have ahead of us. The reason we have such a massive job of work ahead of us relates to the very examples that I have laid down here in the Senate today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reform of the labour market is essential. We, as we said during the campaign, intend to govern for all Australians, not just for sections of the trade union movement and not with the ACTU sitting at the cabinet table. Jennie George and Bill Kelty and their mates are yet to come to terms with the fact that they lost. Every time I see them on television I feel like nudging them and saying, `Hey, hasn't anyone told you you lost?' They are equally determined to ensure that they are going to create as much strife in the work force as they possibly can. The reason is that they know that their viability is at risk. The membership of trade unions is sliding and it will continue to slide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a responsibility of this government to get higher efficiency and productivity which will raise our international competitiveness and, as the Governor-General said, open up new export opportunities. That has to be done through labour market reform. It was an essential plank of our election commitments&mdash;an essential plank of our election commitments that both the Labor Party and the Australian Democrats want to see nosedive. You cannot ask us in Senate question time whether or not we are going to keep our proposals and policies if, at every single solitary turn, you are saying that you are not going to vote for anything. You cannot have it both ways.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also going to bring back effective sanctions against secondary boycotts. That has been one of the things that the Labor Party has always believed is okay&mdash;for people to hold businesses hostage for some other purpose. That is no longer going to happen. There is a change of guard in this town and it is all going to be different.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also going to reduce the red tape and the unnecessary paperwork for small business. One of the problems is that we have people in the Labor Party and in the Democrats who have never had to run a business. They have never paid the bills, they have never paid the pay cheques, they have never paid out workers compensation, they have never paid the electricity, the telephone bills, the rent&mdash;and the list goes on. They do not have an understanding, for one moment, of the impact of fringe benefits tax and the absolutely enormous degree of paperwork it involves. They do not have an understanding of capital gains tax and the enormous mountain of paperwork that that involves. Therefore, everything was just tax, tax, tax, tax, tax, tax, tax. Those opposite have no understanding of the way that that has impacted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been a little while&mdash;it has probably been six months or so&mdash;since I looked through the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Parliamentary Handbook </EMPHASIS>to look at how many people on the other side of parliament had actually run a business. I think I was battling to find two. Therein lies an understanding of the problem: people cannot comprehend how there is a gulf of difference between a trade union mentality on one side and a business attitude on the other side. Business is going to provide jobs, provide prosperity and provide a far more buoyant economy. What the Labor Party and the Australian Democrats are saying is that they will block our business, block our bills and block our election commitments and promises. That is simply not on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I go further and look at some of the commitments that the Governor-General mentioned in his speech, such as the commitment to reducing the economic pressure on families, especially those with dependent children. That should have been done in 13 years of Labor government, but it was not. Likewise, a comprehensive retirement incomes policy should have been developed in the last 13 years to ensure that older people have financial security in their retirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Equally, young Australians should have a better opportunity for the future than they have today. They have been treated very shabbily. To think that we have the highest <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="370"> levels of youth unemployment that this country has ever had and the Labor Party is proud of that is nothing short of a disgrace.</PARA>

That is why it is important to ensure that changes are made, that there is a view to the future, not only for young people but for regional and rural Australia&mdash;for the society in toto. The Labor Party did everything it could to throw a spanner in the works for country people. They operated on the basis that `They will never vote for us anyway, so it does not matter'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have just heard a contribution from Senator Knowles.

Amongst those of us on this side there are a number who have run their own businesses. The rest of us have been involved in professions and trades. We are very proud to have been involved in professions and trades. The contribution that we have made to the wellbeing of this community is of very high and significant value. As a nurse with three certificates and a diploma, I find it particularly offensive to be told that I am useless and do not know what life is all about.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right; there are a few of them in Australia. People do not appreciate having such aspersions cast upon them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a few issues that the coalition keeps pushing. They keep talking about the `$8 billion black hole'. It is important that we dispel that myth very early in the piece. In regard to Access Economics and other economic analysts, the $8 billion black hole they talk about is a forecast. When we are talking about forecasts I suggest we ask what people think about the weather bureau. They are the people who do most of the forecasts that we are aware of. Everyone comments about how inaccurate the weather bureau can be or how those forecasts can change. That is something that this lot opposite us have failed to recognise&mdash;that it is a forecast.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The figure is at the maximum put at $4.9 billion. But before they start crowing about that size, they should also be cognisant of the fact that $2.5 billion of that are changes that were forced upon the savings part of the last <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="371"> year's budget. Those changes were forced upon the government by the Senate. Coalition support was needed for the amendments to be agreed to. So one has to wonder how serious the government is about making real savings to government spending when the coalition last year cut $2.5 billion worth of savings out of the government's budget. That would indicate a bit of a two bob each way attitude.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One needs to remember also what happened in March of 1983, when we came into power. The Treasury Secretary John Stone estimated that the headline budget deficit for 1993-94 was $9.6 billion, in 1983 terms. The GDP in 1983-84 was $195 billion. Therefore, the deficit of the GDP in 1983 was 4.9 per cent. In 1996-97 dollar terms, the 1983 deficit is $24.5 billion. The coalition's estimate from the Treasury for the 1996 budget deficit is $4.9 billion. The GDP for 1996 is around $5 billion. Therefore, the deficit as a percentage is less than one per cent of GDP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now let us compare apples with apples and look at who are the better economic managers. It is far better if there is a less than one per cent deficit as opposed to a 4.9 per cent deficit. That point needs to be remembered by people out there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what is the government planning to do about this deficit? They are going to make cuts. They will not tell us what programs are going to be cut. They are going to make big and savage cuts. Just about all of the Public Service has been threatened with cuts. Obviously, the thinking is that as they do not have any lower house seats and only one Senate seat in Canberra, they do not have very much to lose if they cut the Public Service. What the government has forgotten is that there are about 140,000&hyphen;plus public servants in this country and fewer than 40,000 of them are here in Canberra. Most of the public servants who are providing services to the people of this country are situated elsewhere. They are in the capital cities but they are also in the provincial cities, in the rural and remoter areas. That is what concerns me about the comments about what is going to happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What will happen to the Department of Social Security? We do not know what is happening to its programs&mdash;the minister will <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not tell us. What will happen to the CES? We know there will be a rearrangement and a review of a number of its programs. From discussions I have had in the community, I know there is grave concern that some of these programs, which have been very beneficial to the unemployed, will be cut or changed. What will happen to AQIS? What will happen to Customs? These are vitally important issues that have to be addressed. If the government are going to make the large cuts in the Public Service that they say they will or about which they are kite flying, then they will affect these services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard social security and the CES, if the government is going to make cuts, can they reassure and guarantee me that the CES office and the DSS office in Bourke will remain open? For the last five or six years that area has suffered drought. It is an area of high unemployment and has a high indigenous population. That office services an area of literally hundreds of square kilometres. What will happen to that office? We fought hard to get a social security office in Bourke and I was delighted to be able to open it, but I want to know what will happen to it.</PARA>

You cannot? How do you maintain the work of the Customs officials with their work in keeping out prohibited imports and goods, their work with the AFP and the immigration department on illegal immigrants, drugs coming into this country and this type of thing?

I remember in 1975&mdash;and I am sure that Senator Coates and Senator Foreman also remember&mdash;that they were going to maintain Medibank. Everybody who is old enough remembers the story, `We will maintain Medibank.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By 1983, Medibank existed in name alone. The rebates were down to less than 30 per cent on doctors visits. The only people who <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> could get bulk&hyphen;billing were pensioners who had their pensioner health care cards or those who were classified disadvantaged. To be classified disadvantaged, you had to prove it. You had to prove you were on a supporting parent benefit or were a single parent or the other classification, or you were low income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I worked in the health field at that time, so I know the indignity, the humiliation that people suffered when they had to go and ask their doctors to classify them disadvantaged. In fact, on many occasions I actually intervened and worked as an intermediary on their behalf to seek the agreement of their doctor to classify them disadvantaged, because they felt too embarrassed to have to front up to the doctor's secretary in the waiting room and say, `Can you please classify me disadvantaged?'</PARA>

What does $125 buy for a single person in terms of health insurance? It buys them less than a quarter of the basic public hospital rate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They tell us that they are doing this to try to encourage people to use private hospitals. All people will be buying&mdash;that is, if they spend the maximum rebate they get from the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="373"> government to buy the minimum amount of private health insurance&mdash;is bills and debts. This goes no way towards covering people's health needs. Everybody knows that private health insurance costs money. I know that the previous government introduced legislation to enable private hospitals to set up contracts to advise patients prior to admission what they have to pay. We also made that available for doctors, but the AMA, being the very good union that it is, certainly campaigned very hard against that. It did not care at all about the needs of patients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the issues of interest to me is the $27 million over three years to be provided for rural health professionals. They left the `over three years' out of the documents they sent to everybody, but the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Fischer, announced that it would be over three years. That amounts to $9 million a year. Last financial year the Labor government spent $75 million on rural health care and rural health issues. So what is going to happen in that regard? That is a big drop.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is also offering, in relation to the $27 million over three years, to establish a rural and regional health crisis strategy. The previous government implemented in 1994 a rural health strategy&mdash;a strategy that was endorsed by all the states and territories. The previous government's strategy announced a number of initiatives to address the shortage of doctors and specialists in rural and remote areas. This government has announced that it will provide $1.5 million to establish six university departments of rural medicine around Australia. This will actually reduce by $1 million a year the support that the Labor government provided for the education of rural undergraduate medical students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is going to encourage universities to establish selection criteria to give rural and regional students greater access to medical school programs. The Labor government had a funding program in place to encourage the enrolment of students in medical schools and it had been in place for two years.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first phone call I had on Monday, 4 March was from some rural doctors.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another issue I want to canvass is the government's lack of action&mdash;and that is the only way to describe it&mdash;upon the announcement of the closure of the 14 or 15 regional tax offices in rural Australia. They have done nothing. It might be nasty of me to think&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, my minister did not approve this. It might be nasty for me to say or think this&mdash;and I do not want to offend the tax office, because it is always dangerous to offend the taxation commissioner. However, I could make the argument that, with the change of government and a new minister who may have been busy with other things, it was an ideal opportunity for the government to slip this one through. I call upon the current minister to direct the tax office to review this situation and increase the tax facilities and services that are provided to rural areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We already have the tax offices there, but the government has done nothing about it. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA>They have ignored the pleas of the communities and the pleas coming from their own back benches. That is how responsive they have been to it! I am pleased to see that the IRC has put a temporary stop to proceedings, but the government has done nothing about directing the tax office to reopen these facilities and extend the services available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had a very interesting conversation with a gentleman who had been the manager of a regional tax office. He was able to tell me that the amount of work that regional tax offices were able to do was much greater than that which could be done in the tax offices in the city. I thought that was very interesting, given the government's keenness to make sure that things were more productive. An area where there is greater productivity is in the regional tax office. In the past, the productivity of regional tax offices has been greater than that of the city offices but, by all appearances, the government is not going to stop the closures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another area where there will be government cuts is Worksafe Australia. While the government rails about the terrible unions, big business, employers, et cetera, part of Worksafe Australia includes Farmsafe Australia. I thought it was very interesting that the Deputy Prime Minister went to Wagga Wagga the weekend before last to launch two manuals that Farmsafe had put out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first manual related to what the people on the farm should be doing in relation to first aid in cases of emergencies; the other manual was for the health professionals who were going to be called out to deal with the emergencies. The farming industry is the third most dangerous in Australia, and I would have thought that the National Party would have been very interested to express its concern about what the effects of the possible closure of Farmsafe would be, but we heard nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final issue I wish to deal with tonight is Telstra. I very much support the motion that was moved by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Faulkner) about Telstra. I have great concerns about what the partial sale of Telstra will mean to rural people. We do not know what the long-term <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="375"> plans are for Telstra, because on 6PR during the election campaign the now Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I don't know. We may decide at the end of the first term that all you need do is sell a third. On the other hand we may . . . people may feel its gone so well the most sensible thing to do is to sell some more. I don't know.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the sort of vision this government has for the country. They really do not know.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also had Senator Alston saying during the campaign, and again in here, that the thing that counts with Telstra is the bottom line. I live in an area that benefits from cross&hyphen;subsidisation. For the life of me, I cannot see how, if you sell off a third of Telstra and you have to maximise the return to those private shareholders within the company, cross&hyphen;subsidisation will not be eroded by at least a third. But that is something that the government is not yet able to tell us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Cross&hyphen;subsidisation occurs in a number of areas. It occurs on the annual line fees and it occurs when a new service is installed, and that installation cross&hyphen;subsidisation is pretty significant. It costs a couple of hundred dollars in rural areas to have a telephone put on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just as a matter of interest, during the campaign I got some quotes from trenching companies in the Riverina area. These were the companies that dig trenches so you can put in cable, irrigation pipes or whatever. Their standard charge was $1.50 a metre plus travel. That was just to dig the trench. Then you had to have somebody come along and lay the cable, and then you had to have it back filled. I did not get the quotes for that, but those people living out of town will find that, if they do not have the cross&hyphen;subsidy on the installation, the installation costs will be prohibitive and way beyond their means&mdash;even if they have only a couple of hundred metres of trenching to be dug and cable to be laid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also need to look very carefully at what some of the cross&hyphen;subsidisation amounts are. In the Bega and Cooma areas, they are between $500 and $900. When you go to places like Nyngan, Cobar, Broken Hill or Bourke, the amounts are different. In Broken Hill, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people are subsidised $3,010 per line per year. In Bourke, it is $2,710 per year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am told that Telstra actually cross&hyphen;subsidises at a rate higher than they are required by law to do, so they are actually giving an additional cross&hyphen;subsidisation. That will go when the profits have to be maximised for the taxpayers. Those are the sorts of figures we are talking about. Those are the sorts of imposts that are at risk with the partial sale of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would commend to honourable senators last Friday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> article by Ivor Ries. The article, headed `One phone bill that's too big', said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">If you reckon that a third of Telstra is worth $ 8 billion (the figure given by the Government yesterday), the most that can come from offshore at the time of the float is $2.8 billion. The other $5.2 billion must come from dinky-di Aussies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Raising $5.2 billion from local institutions and mums&hyphen;and&hyphen;dads is a tall order at the best of times.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most recent mega&hyphen;float of this sort was Woolworths, which raised $2.45 billion, and which was over&hyphen;subscribed several times. But the key point there was that most of the oversubscriptions came from overseas fund managers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clearly the Telstra partial sale will be pushing Australia's domestic fund&hyphen;raising ability to the limit.</PARA>
<PARA>It then goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The largest amount of new equity raised in Australia in a single year was $18 billion, and that was during the mania that proceeded the 1987 crash. Even then, most of that cash came from rights issues and other forms of capital raising rather than from initial public offerings.</PARA>
<PARA>It then goes on to talk about the difficulty of rustling up $5.2 billion from local investors and how that contrasts with overseas demand. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Telstra could be sold several times over to foreign institutions, most of which rate telecommunications companies near the top of their core investments.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very important point to remember when people talk about the sale of Telstra.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In making my address&hyphen;in&hyphen;reply to the Governor&hyphen;General's speech&mdash;it essentially sets down the economic course of our government for its term in the parliament&mdash;it is worthy to note that on 1 July in another parliament of this country a new course is going to be set down that will fundamentally redirect, if not disrupt, our social and moral norms. I am referring to the Northern Territory Euthanasia Act. It is very rare that any government influences our lives beyond our economic welfare but, in this case, the Northern Territory act goes to the core of our moral welfare and wellbeing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The act was first passed on 25 May 1995, was subsequently amended in February 1996 and will commence on 1 July 1996. We already know that there are many people awaiting that July date so they can make use of that act. It should be noted that those who seek to make use of that act are not Northern Territorians. They are from other states such as New South Wales and Victoria. So the significance of this act is that it is going to affect all Australians. I can only hope that in this federal parliament we will not have to deal with the question of Medicare funding for euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apart from the fact that a very tiny parliament of 25 members, representing no more than 3,600 people per electorate, voted for the world's first euthanasia law&mdash;and the fact that the parliament of South Australia and the ACT rejected the concept, New South Wales has since shelved a similar bill and no other <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> state has plans for a like debate&mdash;what is truly unfathomable is the change of conscience of so many members of the Northern Territory parliament between May 1995 and February 1996. It is unfathomable because the original bill, introduced in May 1995, was so badly drafted that it eventually would have become unworkable. Therefore amendments were very necessary to make the principle of euthanasia work in practice. Those amendments, as I said before, were brought on in February 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You would have thought that this gave those who voted against the bill the first time the very rare opportunity to have a second chance. They could have voted the amendments down, aiming to therefore foil the bill. What is more, based on the initial vote taken in May 1995 and the change in the parliament since, the amendments should have been defeated&mdash;yet they were not. All eight members of the government, who had initially, in conscience, voted against euthanasia, voted for the amendments and, therefore, the principle of the euthanasia act came in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having involved myself in the debate in the Northern Territory, the greatest disappointment to me was the denial of a true conscience vote for Country&hyphen;Liberal Party members on the amendments and, equally, the acceptance by CLP members of that dictum on the matter. The removal of that right was confirmed to me by the Northern Territory Attorney&hyphen;General, Steve Hatton, in a letter dated 31 January 1996. I will quote a passage from that address to me. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However the government has taken the view that once an Act is passed by Parliament it is the government's job to make it work and for this reason has opposed the suggestion of a conscience vote on the amending Bill.</PARA>
<PARA>That was the reason given by the government. I should say that, nevertheless, credit must go to one member of the Northern Territory parliament, the member for MacDonnell, Neil Bell. Mr Bell has on the table of the Northern Territory parliament a private member's bill to repeal the act, a bill which he seeks to have debated before that very fateful date of 1 July 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regrettably, this last&hyphen;ditch effort to stop the legislation in Australia is likely to fail and, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="377"> for that matter, is unlikely to even be debated, which really is a measure of the determination of the Northern Territory government to push on with euthanasia and all its consequences. One example of its consequences has already arisen: many ill people, dying people, who have come out publicly and said they will commit suicide by injection under the act will simply not qualify under the act. I do not seek to give the names of these people but simply say that such people gave extensive interviews to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> in April this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The consequences will be either to satisfy their will by a very broad, if not illegal, interpretation of the act by qualified doctors and psychiatrists or that pressure will start to mount to amend the act to widen its catch, particularly for the people who have already gone public. Due to these expectations, it is obvious at these very early stages that both the spirit of the law and the letter of the law will be tested and the boundaries will be pushed to the limit. Whatever fences people have attempted to put around this act or will be put around this act will surely be pushed over.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We legislators know only too well that, once the principle of this type of legislation is released into society, it cannot be contained. It and all its consequences would be near impossible to contain. That is made doubly hard by the parliament majority resting on a person who does not have the resolve to stop its unintended consequences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, it is my belief that the Northern Territory act will operate on new tenets for our society&mdash;tenets of hopelessness and neglect. The real fear of legitimising euthanasia is the great uncertainty of where it will lead our society. It will be a very grave error for the sponsors of this legislation to believe that they will ever contain or limit the procedure to the so&hyphen;called aged and frail, particularly as the act encompasses 18&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is something very chilling about a health system encompassing 18&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds that normalises the act of suicide. That is what our society will be doing if it accepts the Northern Territory euthanasia act. Once we normalise the state of hopelessness, we will accept <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the very broad concept of suicide. After all, suicide is only ever chosen when the state of utter hopelessness is reached.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have thought Australia already had a tragic problem with suicides. That has now surpassed even the deaths on our roads. Incredibly, the statistics for those between the ages of 18 and 25 rank highest in the world. We are really obliged to commit our funds and our social resources to tackle this problem, as we do in every other sphere of great concern in the health system, rather than promote the final solution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to ask: where will society draw the line when it abandons life for self&hyphen;induced death in the face of hardship? After all, what is so different about promoting euthanasia as a remedy to physical despair and accepting suicide as a cure for emotional despair? It should be said that, for every shining example of benevolent active euthanasia that the proponents of euthanasia hold up, there is a compelling case where life has been disregarded all too easily. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The critical point here is that there is a clear difference between the right of a person to accept their fate by refusing massive amounts of medical treatment and the choice and administration of medicines that kill. While this distinction is clear and presently legislated for, it is beyond the capacity of legislators, commentators and academics to distinguish between the very blurred lines of manslaughter, coerced suicide and active euthanasia that will inevitably develop under this act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Society will propel itself on a very perilous adventure if it chooses to accept the philosophy of death by request. A democratic society should demand of all its leaders the unequivocal endorsement of the sanctity of life. Beyond all rights must be the right to life. A creed of rights which omits this is no creed of rights at all. I call upon the Northern Territory government to at least allow discussion about and debate of Mr Bell's private member's bill.</PARA>

This is the matter of an international transfer scheme for Australian prisoners who are held overseas. The second issue concerns forced redundancies in the Public Service and what those redundancies mean for the people concerned and their families. I will be suggesting that the government look behind the statistics involved and consider the people behind those statistics. The third issue is Medicare and its appeal to many Australians, particularly to lower income groups. I find it hard to believe that the government will not tamper with Medicare. If it does, and can negotiate any changes through this chamber, it should consider carefully what such changes will have for vulnerable sectors of our society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I return now to the first issue, that of Australians held in prisons overseas.

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PF4">Senator COLSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. Even though these people are Australian citizens, we cannot condone the activity which led to their initial detention and subsequent incarceration. In some cases we may consider their sentences to be harsh, but we must remember that these people have transgressed in a jurisdiction other than ours and overseas countries have a right to set penalties which they consider are appropriate. Be that as it may, there are good grounds for Australia to be party to a scheme or even a number <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="379"> of schemes for the international transfer of prisoners so that Australians convicted and imprisoned overseas can serve at least part of their sentence in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have no doubt that some people in Australia would hold that if a person breaks the law overseas and is subsequently imprisoned there they should complete that sentence before being allowed to return to Australia. Nevertheless, Australia is one of the few countries which is not party to any scheme of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> transfer for Australians held overseas or for foreign nationals who are serving their sentence in Australian prisons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not sure why Australia lags behind many parts of the world in this important area of prison reform. Perhaps it has something to do with our federal system of government, where the federal government can enter into treaties with other countries but the prisons are operated by the states and one of our territories&mdash;the Northern Territory. It is therefore not possible for the federal government to work alone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Agreement with the states and territories is required because it is they who will house any prisoners who return to Australia. This is not an insurmountable problem. The United States of America has far more states than Australia but is signatory to agreements to transfer prisoners into and out of that country. It is granted that the USA has federal prisons, but state prisons also feature in the scheme for nationals returning from overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am aware that a great deal of work has been done in drafting Commonwealth legislation and complementary state legislation to allow Australia to enter into agreements to transfer persons on an international basis. It is not the type of legislation for which the public is clamouring; therefore it probably has a low priority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nevertheless I was disappointed to note that in the legislation which the government intends to introduce this session no mention was made of transfer of international prisoner legislation. I trust that the government will take this matter on board so that Australians who are held in overseas prisons, especially those Australians with long sentences, are given some hope of returning to familiar surroundings of their own country, even though they may be completing their sentences and not have the freedom of movement of their fellow Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is necessary to reply to those who hold that Australians should complete their sentences before returning to Australia. A most distressing aspect of having a family member imprisoned overseas is that many people simply cannot afford to go overseas to visit their loved ones. Some do make supreme <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="380"> financial sacrifices to keep in touch, but even then they can see one another only on an irregular basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If prisoners were allowed to complete their sentences in Australia their parents, their friends, their spouses and their immediate families would have more ready opportunities to visit them on a regular basis. If we subscribe to the notion that prisons should be a place of rehabilitation, it could be argued that a person who is going to re&hyphen;enter Australian society would be better rehabilitated here than in some overseas prison.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole issue of the transfer of international prisoners is more complex than the matters which I have raised this afternoon, including the type of treaties which Australia would need to negotiate, the existing treaties which Australia could enter with little difficulty and the resources necessary to bring the scheme into fruition. I have, however, outlined why we as a nation should legislate so that we do not remain the odd nation out in this area of prisoner transfer. I look forward to the government introducing the necessary legislation at an early date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I turn to the second matter, I would like to comment on an article which was carried in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> last weekend entitled `Thai roulette&mdash;how drug runners beat the odds'. The article in part states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In February, an Australian girl was arrested in Bangkok for drug smuggling. A month later, two women and a man were caught. These are the success stories for the police and Customs. But, each year, countless others take their chance&mdash;and many get through.</PARA>
<PARA>A great part of the article draws a romantic picture of how some Australians can earn $10,000 on one drug run to Thailand. It is a pity the article dwelt so heavily on a person called Mike, who has a mortgage, owns a Holden utility, plays squash once a week and enjoys a beer with his mates after work. Mike may have been lucky in running drugs undetected, but if his illegal actions had been discovered in Thailand someone else would have to pay his mortgage, his Holden utility would be a collector's vintage piece the next time he saw it, squash would become a memory and he would have to do without a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> beer. Depending on his plea before the courts, he would probably receive a minimum sentence of 25 years or a maximum of life&mdash;and in Thailand life means life. Putting aside the immorality of drug smuggling, the lure of tax-free money to become an amateur drug runner is not worth it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the article to which I have referred, Mike was reported to have said, `I never once really thought that I might get caught.' These are famous last words. I have visited prisons in Thailand in which Australian men and women are held in custody. They are well run institutions, but they reflect a culture different from ours. Prisoners, quite correctly, are not allowed to forget that they have lost their freedom. The prisons are not, as some may suggest, `Bangkok Hiltons'. For a non-Thai speaker&mdash;and I suppose for any person&mdash;25 years in a Thai prison takes an awfully long time to pass. For those who are tempted to take their chance to run drugs between Thailand and Australia, my advice is `Don't be stupid enough to give it a second thought.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn now to the second issue: namely, forced redundancies in the Public Service and the consequence of such redundancies in human terms. Most honourable senators would agree that the vast majority of Australia's public servants are conscientious, hardworking officers. Some may have a different personal political philosophy from the government of the day. On the other hand, professional officers can put their political philosophy to one side in the workplace and be loyal to the programs and goals of the elected government. It would be folly to suggest that every position in the Public Service carries tenure, because from time to time old tasks are no longer necessary and new ones emerge. Yet it has been reasonably well accepted that, when an officer's particular tasks become redundant, he or she can usually find another position within the Public Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Against this background, public servants make personal decisions based on what they consider is a future which is reasonably predictable. They make major decisions to obtain a mortgage to buy a home or shift place of residence for the good of the Public <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="381"> Service and their career prospects. They enter hire purchase agreements for motor vehicles and other goods, and they make plans for the education of their children. All of these personal matters can be thrown into disarray if the stability which these public servants reasonably expected is suddenly swept away. This position arises when there are massive reductions in Public Service numbers such have already occurred almost on a daily basis since the resumption of parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point I would like to make is that the government must look behind the mere statistics of the staff reductions it plans. Behind each statistic is a person&mdash;a public servant who may be the only breadwinner in the family&mdash;maybe one of a couple who had planned ahead to raise the capital to buy a home; or maybe an older person who has little prospect of gaining a job outside the Public Service. Dreams will be shattered, financial difficulties can occur, and these can impact on the stability of family life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This impact runs counter to the views expressed by the Governor-General. When opening the parliament, he referred to the family in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reducing the economic pressure on families, especially those with dependent children, is one of the government's most important and pressing tasks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government believes that strong family life offers the best support and welfare system yet devised.</PARA>
<PARA>If the government really believes in its rhetoric about the family, it should consider the consequences of its drastic staff reductions on the family. To suggest that the staff reductions which have already occurred and those which are planned will have little effect on employment figures is hard to accept. Not only will some public servants lose their livelihood; so too will traders who depend on the custom of public servants to maintain the cash flow which is necessary to stay afloat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind honourable senators what the current government&mdash;the then opposition&mdash;said about Public Service reductions during the election campaign. In a press release entitled `Meeting our commitments' issued by Mr Costello on 15 February this year, the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> coalition vowed to secure its savings target of a 2,500 reduction in Public Service numbers `without forced redundancies of Public Service staff'. A day later, in an interview on ABC radio, Mr Costello affirmed the coalition's stance once more when he said, `There will be no forced redundancies whatsoever.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Electors in the Australian Capital Territory would not even accept this figure of 2,500, returning three Labor members to the House of Representatives, which was against the trend in other parts of the country. However, that undertaking made during the election campaign no longer has any currency. Of course, the government will hold that the situation has changed, but I doubt that it has. I did not realise what a strain the possibility of forced redundancies is placing on public servants until a couple of weeks ago when I was dining with two Canberra based public servants. Their entire conversation centred on what they would do in the event that either was caught up in the coalition's post&hyphen;election policy of slash and burn. It is noteworthy that only about 15 per cent of federal public servants are located in Canberra. The consequences of the planned reductions will therefore be felt throughout the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In an interesting twist, only two to three weeks ago my younger son was approached to attend an interview for a position in the Department of Social Security in the Brisbane area. He declined because he was studying full time and plans to complete his law degree this year. Is it a fact that the government anticipates that its policies will leave social security as the only growth area in the Public Service? Perhaps so. I have no doubt that the assault on the Australian Public Service will continue in the coming months. But the point which I must stress is that each one of the persons affected is a real person, most likely a person who has given loyal service as a public servant and who expected to continue to do so. Each has his or her plans for the future which are now in doubt. If the government can do anything to soften the blow and display some compassion, it should do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn now to the third issue: Medicare. As I mentioned earlier, this universal health <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="382"> scheme has appeal to many Australians, particularly those in low income groups. Shortly before I entered parliament in 1975, the then Labor government introduced Medibank, the forerunner of the system of Medicare which we now enjoy. It was a struggle to introduce Medibank. But, due to the tenacity of Bill Hayden, the objections of many sections of the medical profession were overcome. It was a herculean task for Bill. I recall that, at one stage of the public debate about the possible introduction of Medibank, Bill Hayden said&mdash;with tongue in cheek, but indicating the external pressure being placed upon him&mdash;that if he became ill he might have to go to a vet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prior to the introduction of Medibank, there were millions of Australians who had no health insurance cover and who simply could not afford basic health care. Medibank changed that. But, when the coalition was returned to office in 1975, it altered Medibank so that it became almost unrecognisable. I sat through seven coalition budgets between the end of 1975 and the beginning of 1983. I can recall only one of those budgets which did not in some way assault the original concept of Medibank. It was almost an annual ritual in that period that budgets heralded a new health policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was not until Labor returned that the current system of Medicare was introduced. Although some members of the medical profession have fought a rearguard action ever since, overall Medicare has been regarded as a great success.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the election campaign, Mr Howard revealed that he was quite aware of the popularity of Medicare. At the National Press Club, three days before the election, Mr Howard stated, `The coalition will fully retain the Medicare system; the coalition will fully retain bulkbilling and community rating.' Now that we have moved forward two months it is hard to be sure, even though those same words were contained in the Governor&hyphen;General's speech when he opened the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been suggestions that a co&hyphen;payment&mdash;an up&hyphen;front fee&mdash;could be on the agenda. It does not take an Einstein to reach <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the conclusion, as suggested in the Rand Corporation's study in the United States, that co&hyphen;payments would impact on low income persons and their children and on those who are continually in poor health. The coalition government, therefore, should tread warily in adding financial impediments to groups at risk; groups which may find that health care is something beyond their means.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am fearful that, if a co&hyphen;payment&mdash;or some other measures to reduce the cost of the health budget&mdash;is introduced, we may be heading down a track such as the one followed when the coalition was last in government. After countless changes, Medibank became unrecognisable. The same fate could befall Medicare. But, then again, if the coalition proceeds this way, it will meet the same fate as did the last government that effectively dismantled our universal system of health insurance. The opposition will carefully monitor the government's performance on this important social issue.</PARA></SPEECH>

<STATE> (Queensland)</STATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have very much pleasure in supporting the motion moved by Senator Teague in the address&hyphen;in&hyphen;reply to the Governor&hyphen;General's speech and in saying that I will not be voting for the amendment to that motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most of the speakers from this side have talked in glowing terms about the result of the election and I will not cover those grounds again beyond saying that it really was an emphatic result; there was no ambiguity about what the populace wanted and they knew very well what they were voting for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point I would add is that I have never experienced such a climate as has existed out in the electorate since the election. Even two months after the election there is still an undisguised air of relief in the community. There is an air of hope and there is an expectation that Australia will once more get back on the right rails and deliver increasing living standards year by year to the people who contribute to the welfare of society and thereby deliver better things to the whole community. I cannot recall an election in my lifetime after which there was this great sense of relief and hope sweeping through the community. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="383">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The two issues that we went to the electorate with and that were very important were the economy and industrial relations. The introduction of voluntary unionism, the correction of the anomalies in the unfair dismissal legislation and the elimination of secondary boycotts are all key elements that are essential to preserve the human rights of the citizens of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are fortunate in our moves at this time that there has been a progressive shift in public attitudes to the union movement. The union movement has become increasingly irrelevant to the affairs of normal Australians and it has lost the respect of ordinary Australians. When we see on television people such as Ms George, that great friend and soul mate of Senator Kernot, we realise we are dealing with someone whose social and political views have their origins in the 1930s and have not been reconstructed at any time since then. There is overwhelming support in the community for reform of industrial relations and this government will proceed with those moves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second important area is the economy. The Labor Party managed to spend $8,000 million a year more than it earned in taxes, excise duties and other levies. That is, the previous federal government was spending in Australia $22 million a day&mdash;more than $150 million a week&mdash;more than it raised. That money has to be raised from the Australian community and that is why the interest rates in Australia are amongst the highest in the Western world, and why we have such a high level of unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Business needs money at low interest rates. That is something that members of the Labor Party do not understand because none of them was involved in business before they came into parliament. I was in the United States for a week in January this year and the Ford Motor Company was advertising across the country every night saying, `Buy a new car&mdash;4.8 per cent interest on your purchase with 48 months to pay it off.' Very few Australians could attract a loan with an interest rate that would compare with 4.8 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The overspending of the previous government has to be measured against the great <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> revival that has taken place in the Australian economy. One of the few things that Paul Keating got right was that the economy was improving. In fact, since 1991&hyphen;92 the economy has improved by about $120 billion in GDP, and the government take in the form of taxes and other levies has gone up by $45 billion over those few years. Yet the former government still managed to spend $8,000 million a year more than it got in in taxes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people of Australia certainly voted to clean up the problems in the Australian community and to modernise the way society operates&mdash;that is what they are asking us to do. We can compete with Asia and we can compete with the other economic powers around the world if we get our act together. We do have the resources: we have the resources both in the physical and in the human sense to compete with anyone, provided we do not have both hands tied behind our back, as we had under the Labor Party. Since we are in competition with Asia and other countries in the region and, indeed, right around the world, we have to meet that competition. We cannot live by borrowing money to maintain our standard of living, which was the Labor Party's approach to the economy of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this address-in-reply debate, I want to spend some time talking about a report which was tabled in the Senate last week. It was a report by the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee into the crash of RAAF Nomad Aircraft A18&hyphen;401 on 12 March 1990. I will give a little bit of history, to start with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Nomad was designed and built by the Government Aircraft Factories, GAF, and it was not a commercial success. The RAAF, when it was initially presented to them, rejected the aircraft; because of its aerodynamic qualities, they viewed it as not suitable. The Australian Army, less informed on these matters and less discerning, took it up. But the GAF production of the Nomad was an exercise in bad management all the way through&mdash;and no doubt politics by successive governments played a part in covering up mistakes and errors in the production of the aircraft rather than having them corrected the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="384"> way they should have been in a normal commercial operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, a number of aircraft were produced which were not sold. Towards the end of the 1980s when the move was to convert the Government Aircraft Factories, corporatise and turn it into ASTA and ultimately sell it, GAF wanted to rid itself of this inventory. The government of the day, the Labor government, decided to take over 20 aircraft off its hands by allocating 10 to the army, four to the RAAF, and a number were disposed of overseas in barter payments to other countries. The whole program was very badly managed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To put it euphemistically, the aircraft through its whole life enjoyed a very bad reputation. We have never had revealed in this parliament the cost of the Hughes Aircraft Corporation's action against GAF. It was presumably the agent in North America, and it was so alarmed at that aeroplane that it took a damages action against GAF. The Commonwealth settled that for quite a large sum of money&mdash;how many millions we do not know. But that was a measure of the unsuitability of this aircraft in the roles for which it was designed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But to return to these four aircraft that the RAAF acquired in the end of the 1980s, two of them were brand new and two of them were used&mdash;but those that were used were relatively low time. The particular aircraft in question, production No. 128, LSN&hyphen;128, only had 345 hours on it&mdash;which is a negligible time&mdash;when it was acquired by the RAAF on 18 December 1987. When the air force acquired it, the Government Aircraft Factories asked for the aircraft to be loaned back to it because it wanted do further trials.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that, when you read the reports of this inquiry, the initial statement in the board of inquiry was that GAF wanted it back for matters in relation to the Hughes settlement, whereas in the evidence given to the Senate committee it was said that the aircraft was used for drag reduction trials&mdash;and there is an inconsistency there. But it went to ASTA, was there for a while and then came back to the RAAF on 4 August 1989. It did very little flying in both positions. It <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> crashed, killing the sole occupant, Flight Lieutenant Donovan, on 12 March 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The RAAF set up an AIT, an accident inquiry team, who reported rapidly on the accident. They then set up a board of inquiry which, again, looked at the accident in more detail and came to some conclusions. The Air Commander Australia, after the BOI had reported, called for another independent engineering inquiry, which was done. Finally, the Ombudsman was requested by the relatives of the deceased, and by the  Minister for Defence quite independently, to review the three inquiries: the AIT, the BOI and the independent inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to put on the record the comments that the Senate committee put in its report in relation to those inquiries. In relation to the AIT inquiry, it said that the Ombudsman reviewed its report quite favourably. As to the board of inquiry report, it noted that the Ombudsman had agreed with the main findings:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the likely cause of accelerated cracking in the failed component;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the failure to conduct the S17 Special Servicing as the last opportunity to detect the damaged component; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> numerous instances of defective administration.</PARA>
<PARA>It then gave what is a very severe criticism of the board of inquiry, stating:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Ombudsman, however, believed that the BOI had erred by:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> concluding that disciplinary action was not warranted against any person&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and other findings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In general, the company ASTA, as it was then, was quite negligent in its documentation and handling of the aircraft from a record keeping point of view while it was in its charge. It did not tell the Air Force what it had done with this aircraft. But what it had done was use it for very extensive ground running at high power settings, and use it in such a way that that ground running was particularly destructive with respect to the fatigue life of the tailplane&mdash;which ultimately failed and caused the crash. It was so negligent in its record keeping that the initial estimate of time for ground running that it <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="385"> gave the Air Force was for three hours. Later on it lifted that to 177 hours, which is a whole magnitude of difference in time. But even that it thought was a conservative estimate. The maintenance that GAF or ASTA performed on that aircraft and the record keeping was totally negligent, in my judgment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">RAAF project management was not what it should have been. Project management should be a program which draws up all the relevant procedures that have to be followed in relation to the acquisition of the aircraft. This was not a new aircraft from the manufacturer. All the steps had to be taken to  modify it and fit it for service to introduce it into RAAF service. That was done in a very, very poor way. It was done, strangely enough for the air force, by three army officers. A lieutenant&hyphen;colonel was in charge and he had two junior officers under him, both of whom were graduate engineers in aeronautical engineering. It is clear that all three of those officers lacked the depth of experience in aviation matters&mdash;and I am not talking about flying experience or engineering experience&mdash;that they really should have had for that job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shortcomings of the project management really set the scene for everything that followed afterwards. When the aircraft went to the Aircraft Research and Development Unit&mdash;ARDU&mdash;at Elizabeth, the maintenance performed there was very much less than thorough. In fact, one could come to no other conclusion than that it was totally disorganised. There were many gates that this aircraft should have passed through from a maintenance point of view. If any of them had been observed in the correct manner the accident would have been averted because the cracking of the tailplane would have been found. I emphasise that point. It was not a matter of one person or one occasion being involved where this should have been picked up. There were many occasions. On every occasion it was not done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, there was a servicing known as the S17 servicing which the Royal Australian Air Force applies where any aircraft has not flown for 12 months. It is time dependant; it is not dependent upon hours flown. This servicing <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> was due on 6 March 1989. The maintenance unit was advised in February, a month before the crash, that the S17 servicing was due on 6 March. But worse than that, it flagged it as overdue for the six days between 6 March and 12 March, the day the accident happened. That is something that cannot be explained away, no matter what the witnesses said to the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Flying and the maintenance of aircraft is a highly disciplined business, whether it is in the civilian world or the military world. If there is a requirement that an inspection has to be carried out, then it is done. That requirement is either based on the number of hours flown by the aircraft or on the time expired since the last inspection. There is no variation on it. I say that as someone who has been flying for over 30 years and who has owned, operated and maintained my own aircraft for about 25 to 28 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If an inspection is due on such and such a date, you do not fly the aircraft for one or two days past that date; you do not even fly it for one minute. The moment that time expires the aircraft is grounded until the test is made. It is one of the great anomalies that the S17 inspection was not carried out, particularly in a body as disciplined as the Australian Defence Force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is totally irrelevant to argue, as some of the witnesses did before the committee, that the aircraft had not flown much in the preceding 12 months. The board of inquiry, of course, found that, if that inspection had been undertaken, the accident would have been prevented. I do not want to dissect the report and go through the argument in detail, but I would seek leave to incorporate in my speech an article in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> by Karen Middleton which reviews the whole of the report in great detail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The document read as follows:</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Only 170 Nomads were manufactured. So far, at least 66 people have died while flying in them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Why did Glenn Donovan die?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Senate report last week on an RAAF air crash in 1990 uncovered a litany of errors that, but for the statute of limitations, would have resulted in officers facing a military court. But, as Karen <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="386"> Middleton reports, there are deeper implications in the way the Defence Force investigates its own and the Government put commercial considerations ahead of safety.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the clear South Australian sky, Flight Lieutenant Glenn Donovan dropped one engine back to idle and gave the other full throttle. He was an experienced RAAF pilot conducting an unusual but approved exercise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Glenn Donovan did not know that the tail of A18&hyphen;401 had been cracked before he left the ground. The stress of his flying test was too much. It fell off and ended his life.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is defence officials' best guess at what happened when the 31&hyphen;year&hyphen;old pilot crashed in a damaged and poorly maintained aircraft, leaving his family to level serious culpability allegations along a chain of responsibility stretching back 20 years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Senate committee last week closed the book on the death of Donovan with the fifth in a line of reports on the 12 March 1990 crash of his Australian&hyphen;designed and built Nomad aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What it confirmed was that a disgraceful string of bad decisions, poor maintenance, lazy paperwork and lack of follow&hyphen;up contributed to the crash. It found five defence personnel should have been charged under military law for dereliction of duty but were not and, because of a statute of limitations, never will.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate committee also found that the RAAF, Aerospace Technologies Australia (which designed and built the Nomad in its previous guise as the Government Aircraft Factory) and the Civil Aviation Authority all failed to conduct that proper checks in which Flight Lieutenant Donovan put his daily trust. Nobody in either ASTA or the CAA was held responsible. Given the passage of time, the committee thought it was pointless trying to find them now.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Donovan's death uncovered a web of failures by others in the care of his aircraft. It also raised questions about the safety of the Nomad and the legislation and attitudes that govern the way the Defence Force handles breaches of discipline and of law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Donovan's brother, Philip, a former RAAF instrument fitter who works on the Qantas flight simulator, wanted the committee to examine the wider issue of the airworthiness of all Nomads.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But its terms of reference restricted it to that particular crash only and action specific to that aircraft. The committee did not investigate whether the Nomads in the Defence Force could be fundamentally unsafe. It has not decided whether to table the submissions it has received on the wider issue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One, obtained by <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Age</EMPHASIS> , was from Mr Charles Marshall, a former principal aeronautical engineer <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> with the navy, a former wing&hyphen;commander in the RAF and a World War II bomber and test pilot.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Marshall was scathing at the committee's lack of expertise to handle such an important and complex case, labelling it a "farce" because it looked only at maintenance and not the "failure of design, through life monitoring of defects, structural testing surveillance and acceptance". He listed 24 points&mdash;many requiring evidence from the designer, Mr Alan Wrigley&mdash;which needed to be covered before the committee could properly determine responsibility for the tail failure and apportion blame. Mr Wrigley was not called to make a submission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In fact, none of the investigations into the crash of A18&hyphen;401 examined the wider questions, despite the existence of secret flight&hyphen;test reports dating back to 1979 that found that the Nomad had "many fundamental handling deficiencies which seriously compromised flight safety".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A minute leaked to The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  last year showed that the Government of the time knew of the Nomad's problems. The then head of the Defence Department, Sir Arthur Tange, wrote to the then minister, Sir James Killen, in June 1979, warning that the public release of the flight&hyphen;safety reports would have a "catastrophic commercial effect".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Modifications were recommended and made to the Nomad in response to the identified problems but some ADF pilots do not believe they have solved them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Nomad was the pride of Australia's defence industry when it was produced in the early 1970s but did not sell as well as was hoped and only 170 were manufactured. Since then, at least 66 people are known to have died in Nomad air crashes worldwide, although statistics are hard to come by. Even more difficult to quantify accurately is the number of formally reported "incidents" involving the Nomad. ASTA has argued that the Nomad's accident record is comparable to other aircraft of similar size.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is supported by the fact that many of the recorded Nomad accidents have been attributed to pilot error or bad weather conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But the implications of a formal finding that the Nomads might be badly designed or manufactured could nevertheless expose the Federal Government to legal claims from around the world.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After a series of investigations into the A18&hyphen;401 crash, the Defence Force pilots whose job it was to fly the army's Nomads mutinied. In November 1994, the Nomad was formally grounded for military purposes, although it was deemed after review to still be airworthy for civil aviation. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="387"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Defence Force now has 25 Nomads for sale. Many will be sold to private&hyphen;sector operators but up to half are being marketed at foreign governments for use by their defence forces.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some civil operators have defended the Nomad and accused the ADF of prejudice against an essentially safe aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Donovan's plane was certainly not safe. It began its life at ASTA as a test aircraft. In 1987, it was transferred to the RAAF but lent back to ASTA for its testing program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The RAAF did not supply the required maintenance report on handover and consequently ASTA did not supply one when it handed it back two years later. In the meantime, ASTA's record keeping was atrocious. It filed the required monthly reports only twice and focused on flying hours, not taking proper account of the stress caused by hours of running the aircraft on the ground.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consequently, A18&hyphen;401 was far more worn than it looked on paper. On the aircraft's return to the RAAF, it did not receive recommended modifications because there was no funding to modify used aircraft, only new ones. A major service which headquarters suggested (later arguing that this was an order) was not conducted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A less comprehensive service was due on 6 March 1990. It was six days overdue when the aircraft crashed. For some considerable time, the tailplane had been cracked. Most investigations into the crash found that either service, if conducted properly, would have found the cracks.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On top of this, the Civil Aviation Authority received a major defect report from a commercial operator which said almost all its Nomad fleet had experienced cracking, apparently through normal use. It wrote to ASTA with an urgent list of questions. When there was no reply, it wrote again. Although no reply to the letters ever came, the CAA did not follow up the issue. This was nine months before Donovan's accident.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the afternoon of 12 March 1990, Donovan's wife, Bronwyn McIntyre, had the television on. To her horror, it flashed up the wreck of a Nomad which had crashed 25 minutes earlier at Edinburgh Air Base. She rang the base and was given non&hyphen;committal answers until a team of officials and grief counsellors arrived at her home to convey the devastating news according to proper procedure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was not the RAAF's fault that a television network's helicopter had been flying in the area and had captured and aired footage of the crash site before the RAAF could inform Ms McIntyre that she had lost her husband.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was simply the tragic last chapter in a volume of appalling judgments and fatal mistakes, a chain of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> events in which everything went wrong that possibly could have.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ADF says the A18&hyphen;401 crash was a tragic "one&hyphen;off". The ombudsman, the Senate committee and the Government all accept that the institutional procedures that failed have been overhauled so they will not fail again.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But others believe the Government needs to take a long, hard look at the Nomad and take greater responsibility for its litany of problems and their potential to cause further loss of life.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators from Western Australia, but not exclusively from Western Australia, will be saddened to learn of the death of Robert Riley, the former chief executive officer of the Aboriginal Legal Service in Western Australia. I am pleased that both Senator Chamarette, who moved a notice of motion the other day, and Senator McKiernan, who spoke on the adjournment last week&mdash;and edged me out because I was trying to do the same thing but ran out of time&mdash;have spoken on this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Riley was only 41, yet his achievements were outstanding both personally and for the Aboriginal people of his state and of the nation. We now know something of the personal pain and tragedy which he endured as a child but which, with his immense courage, he overcame to attain the respect and affection of a wide range of Aboriginal and non&hyphen;Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of my state parliamentary colleagues in Western Australia worked with Rob Riley behind the counter at the old Beaufort Street courts in Perth in the mid&hyphen;1970s. He tells me that the 18&hyphen;year&hyphen;old Rob Riley's compassion and intelligence were obvious from the day he started work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He did his bit to mitigate the harshness of the criminal justice system on the lives of both Aboriginal and non&hyphen;Aboriginal people by ensuring people got extra time to pay fines rather than serving time in default. He was courteous and fair to the public, who were often distressed or confused about court procedures. His honesty was plain to everyone. It was ironic that both he and my parliamentary colleague were both once wrongly suspected of stealing some petty cash at the court. Despite the intensity of the police interrogation and inquiries, Rob Riley maintained no bitterness towards the police or other government authorities despite what he had suffered and what many Aboriginal people in Western Australia continue to suffer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rob Riley later served in the army and then resumed his interests in the criminal justice system when he started work for the Aboriginal Legal Service of Western Australia. He <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> served in senior positions in the ALS, lastly as its chief executive officer. Between those periods he held a range of senior positions, including national chairman of the National Aboriginal Conference and head of the issues unit of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. The success and respect the ALS of Western Australia has attained in Western Australia was largely due to his leadership and persuasive advocacy on behalf of Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The pressures of being a recognised spokesman for the Aboriginal community were immense. He juggled the demands and high expectations of the Aboriginal community with the harsh realities of state and national politics. He denounced the venomous law and order rhetoric that afflicts state politics in this country with unassailable reasoning backed with statistics and a passion for justice. He exposed the futility of politically expedient punitive legislation which condemned Aboriginal and non&hyphen;Aboriginal young people to institutions and prisons and to fates he knew too well. Despite this, he saw value in everyone. He believed reasoned debate with even the most entrenched opponents would perhaps leave the opponent a little less entrenched and alert the general public to the positive things we could do as a nation to bring justice to the lives of Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="389">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That he made so many friends and gained the respect of so many people from Prime Ministers to police officers is a tribute to his personal skills and dedication to the improvement of the lives of his people and his love for his country. I am sure senators will join with me in expressing our sympathy to his family and friends at this time.</PARA></INTERJECT>
