<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">HEALTH LEGISLATION (POWERS OF INVESTIGATION) AMENDMENT BILL 1996</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill sets the scene for a co&hyphen;operative approach to legislation in this Parliament. The legislation before us today was initiated in the last Parliament and was supported by the Coalition. Today we are honouring this support and invite the Opposition's continuing support of these amendments concerning investigative powers held by the Health Insurance Commission. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These powers permit the Health Insurance Commission to obtain information and conduct searches in order to monitor compliance with Medicare guidelines. They also enable the Commission to execute search warrants and seize materials for the purposes of evidence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This legislation will enable the continuation of these powers following the encouraging report from the Australian National Audit Office which will soon be tabled.  The `Impact of Sunset Clause on Investigatory Powers Follow&hyphen;Up Audit' will confirm that the safety mechanisms employed by the HIC have ensured that powers have been used correctly. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By repealing Section 2 of the Health Legislation (Powers of Investigation) Amendment Act 1994 and Item 68 of Schedule 1 of the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Act (No. 3) 1995, this legislation will enable the HIC to continue to conduct investigations and prepare prosecutions against providers and requesting practitioners who abuse the system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 2 of the Health Legislation (Powers of Investigation) Amendment Act 1994 specifically provides that the entire Act should cease to have force on and from 1 July 1996. The sunset clause resulted from concerns expressed before the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs that the broad ranging powers provided for in the Act offered scope for corruption and abuse of delegated authority by officers of the Health Insurance Commission. It allowed for a reasonable period of time, roughly two years, for Parliament to make a considered judgement about whether the powers had been abused in any way by the Health Insurance Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No evidence of improper activity by the Health Insurance Commission has arisen during this period. Moreover, the conferred powers have improved the Commission's ability to effectively detect and deal with Medicare non&hyphen;compliance and fraud. It is, therefore, important that those powers now be preserved in order to give full effect to the role and function of the Health Insurance Commission as a regulatory body over Medicare practices and fraud.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similarly, Item 68 of Schedule 1 of the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Act (No. 3) 1995 provides that Item 66 and the amendments made by Item 66 of Schedule 1 of that Act cease to be in force from 1 July 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Item 66 ensures procedural fairness in relation to the seizure of evidential materials for the purposes of investigating Medicare fraud and over&hyphen;servicing. It does so by imposing an obligation on authorised officers or officers assisting the Commission to return material seized for the purposes of evidence in the course of conducting searches and investigat <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="90"> ions when the reason warranting the seizure no longer exists or a decision is made not to use the material in evidence. The item, therefore, aims to protect the interests and privacy of a medical practitioner who may come under investigation for fraud.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill establishes that certain measures should be kept in place to allow the continued control and enforcement of compliance with Medicare benefit guidelines.  This bill aims to retain the delegation of powers which have proven, on a trial&hyphen;like basis, to be efficient, substantive and pertinent to the role of the Health Insurance Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the absence of any evidence that the powers delegated by the Health Legislation (Powers of Investigation) Amendment Act 1994 have been or are prone to being abused and distorted, the sunset clause incorporated into that Act should be repealed. In order to preserve a follow on provision in the interests of fairness and individuals' rights, the sunset clause incorporated into the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Act (No.3) 1995 relating to Item 66 should also be repealed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Without these amendments the sunset clause would take effect on 1 July 1996, thus seriously undermining the ability of the HIC to prevent, and prosecute against, Medicare fraud.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend this bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">THERAPEUTIC GOODS AMENDMENT BILL 1996</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill is another example of the bipartisan approach of this Government to improving the health of all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This particular bill has had a tortuous history since it was first introduced into Parliament by the former Government in early 1995. The bill was initially part of an omnibus bill (the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill No.1 1995) which was subsequently divided into more manageable parts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill incorporates and re&hyphen;introduces the provisions of the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill 1995 which was passed by both sides of the House of Representatives on 28 September 1995, but was still awaiting consideration by the Senate when the Parliament rose at the conclusion of the 1995 sittings. As a result, over 600 applications for listing particular products for supply in Australia have been delayed. These applications comprise relatively simple, low risk products such as vitamin, mineral, herbal, homeopathic and sunscreen products.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government welcomes manageable legislation and particularly welcomes the innovations contained in this bill. We note that last year the former Government, who first moved this bill, also actively <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> promoted the measures contained in this legislation. This legislation is therefore brought forward by the new Government as a priority bill for introduction and passage in this session.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provisions of this bill will establish a new accelerated process for placing listable drugs supplied in Australia on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG). This new process will significantly reduce product approval times to a matter of weeks, without in any way affecting the quality or safety of the medicinal products.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the new scheme, products must meet the same criteria as currently exists. These criteria include a statement that the goods are safe for the purposes for which they are to be used, being the purposes identified in the application for marketing, and not other purposes which go beyond the accepted indications for the therapeutic uses of the product.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also provides a much better definition of some poorly understood aspects of the National Regulatory Scheme for Therapeutic Goods, which have been identified in its first five years of operation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A mechanism to address shortages or lack of essential drugs required by the public in emergency situations has also been included, along with amendments that update and consolidate in a new part of the Act, the entry, search and warrant powers to enforce the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill introduces changes to align the monetary penalties in the current legislation with the "penalty units" classification used in other Commonwealth regulatory legislation, as well as closing a gap in the current scheme, in regard to the removal of illegal therapeutic goods of unknown quality, safety or efficacy from the market.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Also included in this bill are provisions to permit warrentless entry of premises to seize goods only where there is an imminent public health risk of death or serious injury, and where there are reasonable grounds for believing that illegal activity is taking place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A definition for "food" has been inserted to clarify the interface between food and drugs. Problems have arisen from the present definition of "therapeutic goods" which excludes "food" but fails to define the term. What constitutes "food" in the bill will be linked to the presentation and promotion of a product in the market. The words "prescribed dose" and "frequency of administration" included in the definition are to be read in a pharmaceutical sense, and are not intended to encompass serving suggestions applied to or normally associated with food and beverages.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other amendments in the bill include a provision to replace the Therapeutic Administration Trust Account with the Therapeutic Administration <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="91"> Reserve, consistent with statutory financial accountability requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The appeal provisions in the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 relating to the review of decisions to register therapeutic goods have also been tightened. This will ensure that technical and scientific data that should be lodged in connection with a general marketing application, will be evaluated before a review on merits is undertaken by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also corrects a defect in the legislation regarding the ability of the Secretary to approve the inclusion on the ARTG of products for export only where those products have been refused marketing approval in Australia. In these circumstances the Secretary is currently empowered to require confirmation that the relevant authority of the country to which the goods are to be exported is willing to accept the goods. This power is however limited to goods that have been manufactured in Australia for export only, and does not extend to products imported into Australia solely for re&hyphen;export. The bill proposes that this provision be amended to ensure that the Secretary's ability to require confirmation from Australia's trading partners of their willingness to accept goods refused marketing approval in Australia, extends to all products, irrespective of whether they have been manufactured in Australia or elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Overall, this bill will benefit Australia's therapeutic industry and further enhance Australia's role as a leader in drug evaluation, registration and regulation in the region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend this bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ordered that the bills be listed on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> as separate orders of the day.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We, the Senate of the Commonwealth of Australia in Parliament assembled, desire to express our loyalty to our Most Gracious Sovereign and to thank Your Excellency for the speech which you have been pleased to address to Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the Thirty&hyphen;eighth Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia. At each first sitting following the opening of parliament by the Governor-General a motion of this kind is moved. It is an established tradition and it is one that I am sure the parliament keeps. Certainly, I move it in that tradition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the motion, we all as senators express our allegiance to Her Majesty the Queen of Australia as head of state. In the same way yesterday, our three newest senators&mdash;Senator Mackay, Senator Lundy and Senator Conroy &mdash;swore, by oath or affirmation, their allegiance to the Queen as the head of state of Australia according to law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say these words with considerable warmth and sincerity, notwithstanding that I strongly support the Australian people considering constitutional reform to adopt an Australian head of state. I also note the gracious expressions of the Queen to the Prime Minister and others that she leaves the determination of that constitutional question to all Australians and that she will accept the outcome of that process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In all of her reign, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II has served this country well in never failing to accept the advice of the government elected by the people of Australia. Any allegiance that we give as senators or as members of the House of Representatives will, if the people of Australia change the constitution, in due course be an allegiance to whoever may be determined by the constitution to be head of state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was very gratifying to see the Governor-General, in one of his most important first undertakings, here in the Senate chamber yesterday representing the Queen in the opening of the Thirty&hyphen;eighth Parliament. We very <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="92"> much welcome the appointment of the Hon. Sir William Deane to the office of Governor-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 16 February, my wife and I&mdash;I am delighted that my wife is in the chamber today, as many spouses have come to the parliament&mdash;attended the splendid ceremony in this chamber at which Sir William Deane, accompanied by his wife and family, was sworn in as our new Governor-General. This followed our farewell dinner the evening before to the retiring Governor-General, Bill Hayden, at which appropriate remarks were made by a number of representatives of the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sir William has our genuine support from the start. As I observe it, that support is unanimous in this parliament and amongst the people of Australia. We know him already as a true Australian, an honourable man, a person who understands the constitution, which it is his duty to uphold, and a man of learning, compassion and humility&mdash;and I like the twinkle in his eye.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Very appropriately, before giving his speech opening the Thirty&hyphen;eighth Parliament we welcomed his statement in expression of sympathy for the people of Tasmania&mdash;hurt, as we all are, by the tragedy at Port Arthur on Sunday. Also, it was on his initiative that we met on Monday in one of the cathedrals in this city, representing the whole nation of Australia as it were, to pray for the people of Tasmania. In that service the Governor-General himself read from the Scripture these powerful words from 1 John 4:7,8:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear friends, let us love one another, because love is from God. Everyone who loves is a child of God and knows God. But the unloving knows nothing of God.</PARA>
<PARA>We all prayed in these words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In our sorrow give us the calm of your peace, kindle our hope, and let our grief give way to joy.</PARA>
<PARA>We have, in the Senate yesterday and in solidarity with all of Australia again this morning, marked by silence our concern and sympathy for and solidarity with the people of Tasmania. It will also fall to us as legislators to give the most careful and intelligent consideration of gun law reform when that time comes. I welcome the remarks of the  Attorney-General, Daryl Williams, and those <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the Prime Minister, John Howard, with regard to the need for our consideration of gun law reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was not only with regard to the tragedy felt by the people of Tasmania but with regard to all Australians that we began the day yesterday, the opening day of parliament, at the service of worship which is sponsored by the Parliamentary Christian Fellowship. I have the honour of having attended 19 of these services of worship. It was another inspiring occasion yesterday before we came here to assemble in the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the great hymns which for many years has been sung at all of our services was written by two great Australians who happen to be friends of mine, Michael and Honor Thwaites. The last verse of their hymn, with which we concluded the service yesterday, was a prayer for all Australia, not just for one state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Lord, life&hyphen;giving healing Spirit,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">on our hurts, your mercy shower;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">lead us by your inward dwelling,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">guiding, guarding, every hour.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Bless and keep our land Australia:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in your will her peace and power.</PARA>
<PARA>I now come to the Governor&hyphen;General's speech itself, which I welcome in its entirety. On this grand occasion I noticed the attention given by all 76 senators in this chamber, of all 149 members of the House of Representatives, of the members of the High Court, of our spouses, of the former Prime Ministers, of the secretaries to departments, of the press. Indeed, it was a grand occasion for the parliament, as has been the opening on all 38 such occasions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The speech was succinct, positive and clearly displayed the values and objectives of the new government, the coalition government led by John Howard. I noticed that here in the centre of the chamber the leaders of the government, Prime Minister John Howard and Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer, were, if possible, the most attentive of all as it was on their advice that the Governor&hyphen;General was outlining the government's program for the three&hyphen;year period of this Thirty&hyphen;eighth Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were no surprises. This is a government intent on keeping its promises. But, on <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="93"> an occasion such as this, where there has been a change of government after 13 years of a Labor government and we have the inauguration of a Liberal and National government, we can expect a flourish of announcements, we can expect a statement of idealism. It is therefore not surprising that we have reference to `excellence', `cohesion', `great responsibilities', `national challenges', `unequivocal commitment', and references to particular areas of policy, such as a realistic defence policy, a constructive foreign policy, an active trade policy, and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say again that these are good aspirations, these are the appropriately flourishing words expected by the people of Australia of this parliament and of the government. Cynics, some observers&mdash;I have not heard any in this parliament&mdash;might regard some of those phrases, the introduction and conclusion, as somewhat purple or even cliched. But I assure the Senate that the response of most of us&mdash;I think, with graciousness, of all of us&mdash;is that this is not the case because with a new government outlining the program for which it has a mandate we are not hearing hollow rhetoric; we are hearing the specific program promises of the new government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those specific programs relate to: youth employment; the promotion of small business; the reform of the labour market; raising national savings; boosting the competitiveness and productivity of the Australian economy; positive environmental measures; micro&hyphen;economic reform; tax relief to assist families and self&hyphen;funded retirees; new vocational and educational training initiatives; solutions to the problems of young Australians; positive policies for women, for indigenous Australians, for a multicultural Australia, for the arts, for constitutional reform, and for improving the standing of the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The speech, as we all heard, was divided into eight parts. The first relates to the government's objectives, the second to jobs, or the economy more broadly&mdash;industrial relations reform, small business, micro&hyphen;economic reform&mdash;and the third part to families, community services and the elderly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth part relates to young Australians, to jobs and training, and the fifth to regional <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australia which, as I do not need to remind the Senate, was one of the important battlegrounds at the last election. Regional Australia was comprised of electorates that had to be won by whoever was to become the government. The sixth part related to foreign affairs, defence and trade. The seventh part was titled `A Cohesive Society' and stressed unifying Australia rather than dividing one part from another. It emphasised `the government's commitment to govern in the national interest and not for vested interests'. The conclusion summarised these initiatives with appropriate flourish and commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before moving to some particulars I draw attention to the first sentence of the Governor&hyphen;General's speech, which contained these gracious words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 2 March the Australian people entrusted to a new government the responsibility of managing the nation's affairs.</PARA>
<PARA>That is opening&hyphen;of&hyphen;parliament&hyphen;speak for, as politicians would say using their vocabulary, `What a beauty! We won! The election was a success for the Liberal and National parties.' After five losses in which my colleagues and I have participated through the 1980s and 1990s, it is fantastic to have a win.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the themes of our meeting yesterday as we greeted each other was this note of celebration and joy in winning endorsement for the Liberal and National parties' programs put forward at the election. I take this opportunity to say that I trust democracy. I believe that people get it right if they are informed. Certainly, my colleagues and I cannot argue with the democratic outcome on this occasion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In South Australia, for example, 10 of the 12 House of Representatives seats were won by my party. In the Senate the Liberals will have six senators, the Labor Party four, the Democrats two. This is just one example of the dimension of the sweeping change in a vast national swing that has endorsed the Liberal&hyphen;National Party government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">May I also note with regard to women's representation in the parliament that South Australia continues to lead the way towards equality of representation by both men and women. As a result of the election, five of the 12 South Australian senators are women&mdash; <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="94">nearly half&mdash;and four of the 12 House of Representatives members are women. Of all these women in the parliament from South Australia, two&hyphen;thirds of them are members of the Liberal Party and my good colleagues. I congratulate them all. Indeed, I congratulate all those who  have won election from every party and every state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me give my brief view&mdash;as I am sure this will be a theme which will be taken up in this address&hyphen;in&hyphen;reply debate&mdash;as to why we had this outcome. First of all, Labor lost the election. After 13 years it was time, and I see the gracious smiles of Labor members opposite. They are used to some victories but they distinctly lost this one. The people of Australia not only wanted to endorse a Liberal&hyphen;National Party government with all the freshness and vigour of its policies and programs but also wanted to reject the failures of Labor after 13 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are three lessons I would mention. I do not say this patronisingly to my colleagues opposite, but indeed to put it on the record for all of us. One, do not mess up the economy; it loses votes. Two, do not break promises; it loses votes. Three, do not lie and do not condone lying; it loses votes. I say that very seriously. I also of course see that the greater factor in the outcome of the election was the positive program of the Liberal and National parties. Those positive programs and policies have been summarised in the Governor&hyphen;General's speech itself, and as we see the legislative program unfold over these coming months we will see that in action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were no disasters in the Liberal campaign: there was no GST, there were no hit lists, and there were no alarms set running about the reforms we envisaged. There was moderation, there was a sensible explanation of our polices, there was a direct appeal to represent all Australians. I congratulate John Howard, who superbly led my party's campaign, and I commend every member and senator for their efforts in the campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> In the time remaining I would like briefly to address five particular matters: first, the wellbeing of Australian families; secondly, the essential investment that must be made in education; thirdly, the removal of all govern ment taxes and imposed costs on Australian exports; fourthly, the priority of Australia's foreign policy and trade in the countries in Asia, a priority that I have supported for many years; and, fifthly, the importance now of allowing the people of Australia to participate in and to own positive constitutional reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to the wellbeing of Australian families, I quote a statement made by Morris West, a noted Australian author, with regard to the family in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Magazine</EMPHASIS> just this last weekend. It touches upon a matter which I am sure is part of the incentive for the government to bring in tax relief and other measures to help strengthen families in Australia. Morris West wrote these words:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The breakdown of the family structure is very real, of that structure within which the child can be nurtured and cared for and given a set of social standards which they may later reject but which help them to survive in a moral sense. We seem to be producing on the one hand feral tribes and on the other, because of travel, closed&hyphen;end societies.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mechanistically, the whole protective structure of society is breaking down. The notion of `parish' or village or small town which was to a degree self&hyphen;supporting and self&hyphen;educating in the moral sense is impossible to administer now. Mega&hyphen;cities are throwing people into total isolation, . . . The Internet, the global village . . . (are) driving people back on themselves: they are communicating with an inanimate object, with no tactile response or contact. The same with television, mere shadows on a screen . . . Alienation and isolation is becoming total. And if you look around at the debasement of children, of individuals, at repression, war, drugs, torture, then evil certainly is winning . . . the old notion of conflict between good and evil contains an essential truth.</PARA>
<PARA>I quote that not because I agree with all of it; I am actually much more optimistic. I believe that families can be constructive in finding remedies for those evils and for those tendencies which lead to alienation and amorality which Morris West has referred to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In so far as the legislature can address these matters, we must do so as a top priority. But let me say that not everything is solved by the government or by legislation. A great deal is solved by the initiative and resources of families themselves in their personal interaction, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="95"> by churches and by education processes and by community associations. We need to enhance and lead the forces that make for positive good and reinforcement in the family from all those quarters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me briefly also refer to the family's current prized possession&mdash;the family home. Too often, it is a magnificent building with everything that opens and shuts but for many this prize is hardly ever used. Often the cry is, `There's nobody home.' We have sometimes seen families invest huge resources in the family home to find that it is empty or used for only six or seven hours sleep a night.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Families, in some senses, have never had so much money. They have never been richer. That is not true of all families, but I think it is true of the average Australian family. Despite this richness, many families have a reduced quality of life. For example, there is too much use of child-care centres. Child-care centres are good and they must be provided, but I think we are using them too much. Families are eating too much fast food. They are spending too little relaxed time together. I am much more optimistic than Morris West. I believe that the best models of Australian families are already addressing these deteriorations and are actually finding solutions. I wish that to be extended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The second issue I refer to relates to the essential investment that must be made in education. I stress that there is ultimately no way to dilute the truth that the greater part of education provision must come from the public purse&mdash;from the allocation of taxpayers' money through government budgets. There is no ultimate escape from the budget foundation that education requires real dollars from real governments. Although we may have efficiency reforms, avoidance of duplication, a contribution by students and parents through HECS, incentives for university research to win support from the private sector and so on, ultimately the coalition government and all governments must keep their promises for universities, schools and vocational education and training so that there will be no reductions in the real allocation of money from Commonwealth funding. The government's budgetary commitment to educ ation is a fundamental investment in Australia's productive future. The challenge is to make sure that that investment is secure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thirdly refer to the priority of removing all government taxes and imposed costs on Australian exports. That aspiration has been expressed by the coalition for several election campaigns. Now that the coalition can make those changes it is in a win&hyphen;win situation. Those changes will generate exports and ensure the best path to prosperity for the Australian economy and the Australian people. At the same time they will generate the political capital in regional Australia and in large and small business to ensure support in the next and subsequent elections.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fourthly, I refer to the priority of Australia's foreign policy and trade policy in relation to the countries of Asia. The Governor-General's speech states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there will be no higher priority for the Government than advancing relations with countries in Asia, with particular emphasis on Indonesia and other members of ASEAN, Japan, Korea, China and India.</PARA>
<PARA>I support this priority wholeheartedly, as would be well&hyphen;known in the Senate from my speeches on foreign affairs, trade and defence matters over many years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also commend the next paragraph of the speech which states that the government will carry out its program in these areas through bilateral, regional and global negotiations. There will be direct bilateral negotiations, one country to another&mdash;I have advocated that for many years&mdash;which will benefit Australia. All three dimensions of negotiations will be used. The speech further states that the government:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . attaches particular importance to APEC as a forum for trade and investment liberalisation in the region that will also act as a catalyst for further global trade liberalisation.</PARA>
<PARA>I again endorse that. I believe that APEC genuinely has the bipartisan support of the parliament. The advantage is that the new government will approach achieving APEC's potential with fresh vigour and action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final matter I refer to is the importance of allowing the people of Australia to participate in and to own positive constitutional <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="96"> reform. I seek leave to incorporate in my speech the one&hyphen;page summary of the coalition's position on the republican issue.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you very much for your courtesy. I hope that I may receive leave to incorporate the document when I finish my speech. I wish to refer to a couple of undertakings that the coalition has made on the republican issue. Point 4 of the document states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In government, the Coalition will in 1997 establish a People's Convention to debate the whole issue. There will be other matters discussed at the People's Convention. However, the issue of Australia's Head of State will be debated first and separate from other issues.</PARA>
<PARA>I endorse that statement and look forward to its implementation in the coming months to ensure that the coalition's undertaking is achieved in 1997. Point 5 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If a consensus emerges from the People's Convention regarding the Head of State, that consensus will be promoted by the Government at a constitutional referendum.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the commitment given by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in June last year which led to this issue being non&hyphen;contentious at the last election. As John Howard and the coalition said, Australian people will have a vote about the republic no matter who wins the next election. I am optimistic that this process will allow the people to be all the more consulted and that it will all the more determine the outcome of constitutional reform. I am even optimistic that, as a result of these undertakings by the coalition, there will be a greater prospect of the broader political support necessary to see the eventual referendum succeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After 18 years in the Senate, I will be leaving at the end of this initial two&hyphen;month sitting period.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Keating's comments about an Australian Head of State are an attempt to imply that anyone who opposes a republic is a lesser Australian. The reality is that over the past thirty years, the Governor&hyphen;General has become Australia's constitutional Head of State. That position has been occupied by an Australian since 1965.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Despite the success of the present constitution, many Australians are attracted to the idea of a republic and the Coalition believes that the matter should be fully debated and ultimately a vote taken on the issue before the turn of the century.</PARA>

I am also more than pleased to be part of a coalition government which has a handsome mandate to nurture Australia and all who live here. I thank the Australian people everywhere, on the farms and in the factories, in the shopping centres and right across the six states and two territories of this vast country, for their trust and acknowledgment of our commitment to govern `for all of us'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> I would like to congratulate the new Howard ministry, particularly our Senate colleagues and Senator Hill, and my leader, Senator Boswell. The members of the ministry have a depth of talent and previous experience of real life Australia that automati cally makes for a new style in administration. I wish Senator Faulkner well as the opposition Senate leader. He follows in that role some of the great contributors to Labor's cause in recent years, including the late Senator Murphy and former Senator Button and Senator Gareth Evans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The excitement of the opening of this parliament is tempered by the tragedy in Tasmania. Violence devalues everyone because we are all transparently equal before indiscriminate violence. Much has been already said about the massacre but a major concern of mine, and one often mentioned by the former Prime Minister Mr Keating, is the unacceptable level of violence still shown on our television sets. For what it is worth, my personal view is that no extreme violence should be shown on free to air television at any time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My first involvement with a parliamentary opening was on 4 May 1993 when the previous Governor-General, the Hon. Bill Hayden, opened the 37th parliament. As I had not yet taken my Senate seat, I listened to the speech from the President's gallery and I could not help but notice the expressions on the faces of the government members. There appeared a mixture of certainty borne of 10 years of government and absolute disbelief that they had been able to pull one last election out of a confused electorate. It seemed to me that the government had little expectation of being re-elected and the members were as surprised as everybody else that they were again in power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to congratulate the Haydens for their period in Yarralumla. It could not have been a more difficult time for a former republican and Labor minister to be Governor-General. But just as the weight of government tends to change people's perspectives, so too did his period as our head of state. He carried out his duties with decency, dignity and, above all, humour. He travelled overseas as our head of state and made constructive additions to some of the great debates of our time like euthanasia, our treatment of the aged and, in fact, the role of the Governor&hyphen;General itself. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="98">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He is an extraordinary Australian and his path through public life has enriched us all. I wish Bill and Dallas Hayden many happy years on the farm. I understand that he recently had a fall from a horse and broke a rib. Riding is a bit like politics: we all fall off from time to time but generally most of the damage is done to our pride which, in the scheme of things, is of no importance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday in the chamber we witnessed the traditional ceremony during which our new Governor-General, Sir William Deane, opened the 38th parliament and outlined the government's programs and priorities for the next three years. In that ceremony there was a coming together of the three components of what is known as the Westminster system: the sovereign, the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Westminster system is a flexible system and is constantly under review but it has served the English mother of parliaments well and it has served our federal and state parliaments, and in fact other parliaments throughout the Commonwealth, equally well. It is a core element of our democracy and as Churchill said, `democracy, whilst not a perfect system, is the best.' We remain one of the few and longest lived democracies in the world and our commitment to the Westminster system has largely facilitated that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One component of our system is the sovereign, who in Australia is represented by her personal representative, the Governor-General. The role and the whole approach the coalition takes to constitutional change will be part of our program over the next few years. The coalition is determined that proper community involvement will be provided in the review of Australia's constitution. We want to build on the effective system we have, not distract or falsely claim to simplify a system of government which both federally and in the six states has made us the envy of most political entities in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not often find occasion to quote the former Prime Minister of New Zealand, Mr David Lange, but he is quoted as having said that constitutional reform tends only to occur when an existing system withers on the vine. I do not know whether, in the broad, our <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> system has reached that stage, though there are reforms that are necessary in the federal&hyphen;state and federal&hyphen;state&hyphen;local government relationships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth being reminded of the view held by the former Governor-General Bill Hayden&mdash;that is, a republic per se might lead to considerable political instability. We can do without that instability because, after all, the present system has worked remarkably well. To hasten slowly is essential because ultimately if there is to be change it will be the people's choice. I am pleased that we will legislate to ensure the flag cannot be changed by any government without considerable effort. I am sure that all those who fought under our present flag will be very pleased about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The great difference between a coalition government and a Labor government is the pre&hyphen;eminence Labor gives to special interest groups, and especially their desire to represent and foster organised labour in a way that many of us consider unrepresentative. Unions, like any other representative organisation, have a positive role to play. I am a member of a union&mdash;the National Farmers Federation. But unions, like political parties, should exist only on the basis that they earn their keep. They have responsibilities, not just rights. The fact is that almost all Australians believe that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To tread the fine line between being fair to all and giving special favours to some is a problem that all political parties face. But it is appropriate at this time to give credit where it is due. The previous government, for better or for worse, had a commitment to Australia and I congratulate it on that. The ministers worked under enormous pressure&mdash;as all ministers do&mdash;to guide the ship of state. The often quoted statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), that the things that bring us together are much greater than the things that divide us, is very true. Australians are fortunate indeed in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the last government's term, when Prime Minister Keating embroiled himself in changing Australia's identity or the flag, I often used to think of Adlai Stevenson's quote that patriotism is not a short and frenzied outburst of emotion but the tranquil and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="99"> steady dedication of a lifetime. We all should reflect on that from time to time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all agree that healthy democracies require changes in government. People want to be part of the debate. Electors are not to be taken lightly. On 2 March the electorate expressed its choice, giving the coalition 94 seats in the House of Representatives, with five more seats going to Independents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my state of New South Wales, Labor holds only one regional seat&mdash;the electorate of Hunter&mdash;and the former Labor regional seat of Calare went to an Independent. The National Party is determined to give the electors of Calare a voice in the coalition government. I personally give my commitment to that region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To be an Independent in Canberra is to be almost entirely ineffective. `Fine words butter no parsnips', as grandmother used to say. All the well-meaning words of well-meaning Independents are pretty irrelevant in the scheme of things. We all know that. To be an Independent in a world of difficult national decisions is akin to having a leg either side of a barbed wire fence. It is not a place to be recommended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been much written about the new government's mandate. Some sections of the media and the Australian Democrats seem to have forgotten the basis of our democratic system: that is, the party which wins the most seats in the House of Representatives is the party with the mandate to govern. The coalition's policy platform was clearly laid out and became part of the policy debate during the election. Australia voted overwhelmingly for that platform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The more cynical or humorous might argue that if the coalition had merely smiled and said, `Trust us,' the devastation of Labor might have been more complete. But we did not do that. We took the hard decisions. We released our policies&mdash;including our 1990s&hyphen;appropriate industrial relations reforms; the partial sale of Telstra; and our commitment to the family, to savings, to small business, to the young and older Australians, and to accountability in government generally&mdash;and they were clearly endorsed.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is fair to say that new governments frequently claim a mandate but they do so at their peril if the mandate is false. This is the most honest claim to a mandate that I have ever seen in this country. I ask the Democrats to think carefully before they talk about their mandate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After all, the coalition achieved a 46-seat majority in the House of Representatives. If we look at the Senate in isolation and at the 40 seats which were determined on 2 March, 20 seats were won by the Liberal-National parties, 14 by the Australian Labor Party, five by the Democrats, and one by the Tasmanian Greens. After 1 July, the Liberal&hyphen;National parties in the Senate will hold 37 seats out of 76. The Democrats achieved a stand alone quota only in South Australia. What that mandate amounts to is for my wise friend Senator Kernot and her team to decide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the greatest challenges we face, one which transcends mainstream political differences and state and international priorities, is the environment. In a global or macro sense, the greenhouse effect, acid rain and more are important for our global village. Here at home we have enormous problems with managing our environment&mdash;with managing our major river systems, water generally and land use. Farmers in the main are the great environmental protectors. Over the years there have been examples of misuse of land. Frequently, these have been unforeseen and have been compounded by drought or through change of land use.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The importance of the landcare movement and water conservation is acknowledged by the new government, but more needs to be understood. We are absolutely committed to sustainable agriculture. We will be responsible and innovative to an environment which meets the expectations of land users&mdash;in other words, all of us. The way we harness the environment impacts on our industries, on our lifestyles and on the types and situations of new and existing regional centres. It extends to all our export earning industries, including tourism, which demands our physical environment to be protected as far as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I live on the edge of the incredibly fertile Liverpool plains in New South Wales, which <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="100"> has some of the finest farming land in the world. Although there is substantial irrigation water available, the water table is dropping, it is frequently stressed, and the problems of salinity are now appearing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some parts of this area that are not used for grain are used for beef production, which is a very satisfactory use of fertile farming land. However, the current low beef prices are making the process of using that land for that purpose a near waste of time. Why are beef prices so low? Australia, which produces wonderful beef, cannot compete with our New Zealand and United States competitors to supply traditional markets, because of the inefficiencies in our abattoirs. It is the industrial relations system that presently exists in our abattoirs that therefore has an potential impact on land use in grazing areas of Australia. There is an amazing interrelationship in the economy these days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The impact of water cleanliness is something that concerns everybody: from Centennial Park in Sydney, which takes the run&hyphen;off of five council areas and where signs give health warnings against letting your dog swim, to the horrendous public relations battle to put the problem of the Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin in perspective. Australians will never accept that this major river system should be allowed to disintegrate. The devastation of some tracts of land west of the Darling should not be allowed to increase. Problems of the environment have to be discussed, whether they concern the cotton producers, the feedlots, the piggeries or whatever. We must address these complex issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The linchpin of the coalition's approach to government was summed up by Mario Cuomo, a former governor of New York, when he said, `It is not the government's obligation to provide services but to see that they are provided.' That simply puts in perspective the fact that services will be provided to all Australians, whether they live on the coastal strip or in the vast outback. There is no way, from a National Party point of view, that we will not be pushing to restore the appropriate balance for people who live</PARA>
<PARA>outside the metropolitan areas. The previous <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government, largely reflecting its narrow electoral base, was particularly isolated from the inland and from an appropriate understanding of regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not happy that the sort of commitment that is necessary to restore the balance to regional Australia is fully understood. I am not happy that those in the bush have been forced to the limit by drought and government indifference. I am not happy about regional Australia's health care, roads, fuel prices or access to welfare assistance&mdash;be it Austudy or access to a living wage whenever non&hyphen;performing assets exclude drought ravaged farm families from help. I am not happy about the process of committing Australia to the requirements of international treaties and United Nations conventions. These must be more subject to scrutiny by the Commonwealth parliament, the states and the community before they are entered into on Australia's behalf.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Governor&hyphen;General outlined very important measures which the government will implement to improve the lives of Australians everywhere&mdash;improvements not just in the present but lasting into the future. I believe that good government is not just about facilitating efficiency and productivity in the public and private sectors. Good government is not just about making sure we have sufficient capital and consumer goods and services. Political and social realities and conflicts must not be entirely subsumed by economic ones. Good government is about equity and balance. The National Party will endeavour to bring those qualities to government decision making processes. Good government reflects the collective social, cultural and economic concerns of society. Good government is about improving the prospects of people. A coalition government will do just that.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me thank Senator Teague and Senator Sandy Macdonald for their contributions. I must say that, although I did not agree with all the sentiments they expressed in their speeches this morning, I do genuinely appreciate the spirit in which they were made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="101">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the outset of my contribution I want to move an amendment to the address&hyphen;in&hyphen;reply motion. I move:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At end of motion add ", and the Senate is of the opinion that no part of Telstra should be sold".</PARA>
<PARA>The opposition is committed to a 100 per cent government&hyphen;owned national carrier. I believe that selling part or all of our communications carrier, worth some $24 billion, would be an act of gross irresponsibility in itself. For the government to claim that it will be a more competitive company after privatisation is just arrant nonsense. It has been corporatised and it is already competing very successfully in the international market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We made our position crystal clear in the election campaign when the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, said on January 23, `Telstra is simply not for sale.' The opposition also regards as thoroughly objectionable the government's approach of making environment policy some kind of bait or trade&hyphen;off for the Senate to agree to the sale of Telstra. That also is an absolute nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra is a very strong, very vibrant company which achieved record profits of $3 billion in 1994&hyphen;95. It is aggressively seeking and claiming new markets in Asia. Its value has increased from $18 billion when John Hewson wanted to sell it to around $24 billion now. We believe that inevitably a partial sale of Telstra would lead to its complete privatisation. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has never hidden his intentions. In the election campaign, Mr Howard promised that a third of the company would be sold in the term of this government. He never denied, of course, that all the $24 billion resource would be flogged off in the longer term, including to non&hyphen;Australian companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I particularly want to concentrate this morning on this very shabby link that has been established between environment funding and the sale of Telstra&mdash;the holding hostage of environment funding in this country to the partial sale of Telstra. I must admit it was good to see that Tim Fischer fessed up to what it was all about, that the link was merely a ploy `to captivate a Senate vote', to use his words. I think only Tim could say <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that, but we all understand what he means. He said that on 2CS on 2 February 1996. The link was a ploy `to captivate a Senate vote'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we need to get very clear that it was not because the hearts of those in the coalition were in the environment policies that were presented by them at the election: their land and water degradation programs, which we have heard something about already today, the rehabilitation of the Murray-Darling Basin, national river care, coasts, clean seas and the national reserves cooperative program. It was not because their hearts were in it. Understandably, of course, these very environment policies were ours, were Labor's, and they were stolen for electoral reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition concocted the shabby link because it wanted to flog Telstra off by captivating the minor parties. The dry agenda far outweighs the wet. I think the coalition failed in this shabby trick, failed in the election campaign, to convince a majority of Australians that this was a reasonable proposal. I think, without doubt, it was the single biggest negative that the coalition had in that election campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor, of course, made very clear its level of commitment to the environment. We have always believed the environment in this country should be supported with adequate public funding with no strings attached. We actually happen to believe that the environment, and its protection, is a vital issue in its own right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In our own time in government, without strings, we were able to ensure the protection of Uluru, Kakadu, the Franklin River and, more recently, Jervis Bay, Shoalwater Bay and the Hinchinbrook Channel. In our term we expanded the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park from 14 per cent of the region to 98 per cent of the region. We introduced the national biodiversity program, the best forest policy this country has ever seen; the endangered species program; the national reserves cooperative program; the save the bush program; the one billion trees program; the Antarctic mining ban; the national corridor of green; the river health program; Waterwatch; national <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="102"> wetlands program; the regional environmental employment program and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Each and every one of those achievements, and the many other achievements that the Labor government made in environment policy, were made with no strings attached. Any government that is worth its salt should really show the same level of passion and commitment to protecting the environment without blackmailing the electorate. I do believe the coalition for a very long time has shown a very clear uninterest in environmental issues.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In answer to your question, Senator Hill, I do believe that the coalition's national heritage trust is a worthy objective, but I do also believe that it has to be achieved. It has to be funded without resorting to Thatcherite funding mechanisms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor does not accept that the government has an unfettered mandate to sell Telstra. During the election campaign, the Labor Party made its position absolutely clear on this issue. I well remember the day in the election campaign when the announcement was made in relation to the part privatisation of Telstra and establishing the link to the coalition's environment policy. I well remember that some 60 minutes after that policy became public it was tagged as, `This is the Telstra environment policy'. I well remember that many of us in the Labor cabinet at the time very quickly considered what our approach would be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the 1993 election campaign&mdash;in fact, well before the campaign commenced&mdash;when an issue of similar significance came forward, which was the establishment of a goods and services tax in Australia, Labor made a decision that it would not oppose that measure in the Senate. We made our position clear, and we made that position clear because of the amount of time there had been for public debate on Dr Hewson's program, which had been exposed to the electorate some 18 months before the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the recent election campaign Labor said it would not vote for the partial sale of Telstra. We said it from the time the coalition <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> announced its policy. We did not waver, we have not wavered, and we will not waver. We gave a commitment to those people who voted for Labor in the House of Representatives and the Senate that we would do everything in our power to maintain Telstra in public ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard from a number already in the chamber that the Liberal Party has a majority to put its programs into effect. Undeniably, the Liberal Party does have a very handsome majority in the House of Representatives. It is a truism, of course, that it does not have a majority in this chamber. There is no doubt that some Australians who voted for the coalition in the House of Representatives did not vote for coalition candidates in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Throughout the election campaign, from the time the environment policy of the coalition and the proposal to partially sell Telstra was announced, the position of Labor, the Australian Democrats and Green candidates on the Telstra issue became clear. I have never been in any doubt that some voters may well have cast their vote in favour of coalition candidates in the House of Representatives knowing full well that the chances of the Senate passing legislation to enable the privatisation of Telstra were extremely remote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that we do always need to take account of the impact our parliamentary system and processes have on the concept of mandate. No-one in Australia expects any opposition to just roll over and allow legislation to flood through the Senate or upper house without appropriate scrutiny. No-one believes that. A free flow of legislation, a rubber stamp by the Senate, does appear to be Senator Hill's dream scenario, but it has never happened before&mdash;never in Australian political history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="103"> I also want to make this point: in Labor's approach to opposition in this chamber we are going to be both sensible and constructive. We are not going to take the same approach that the new government parties did in this chamber when they were in opposition. Just this morning when poor old Senator Kemp was floundering with his first efforts as Manager of Government Business in the Sen ate, I was there to assist him. The government received the assistance of the opposition just this morning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that, while we will take our responsibility seriously when legislation comes before us, we will be judicious in our approach. We will be judicious in our review. We will not be obstructionist. We will not be resorting to the same sorts of tactics at which the coalition became expert over 13 years in opposition. We are not going to involve ourselves in deliberate disruption. We are not going to involve ourselves in time wasting. We are not going to involve ourselves in filibustering. We are going to behave in a sensible and constructive way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the Telstra scam during the election campaign&mdash;and that is what it was: a scam&mdash;we believe we have an absolute obligation, an absolute commitment, to the people who voted for us, and we intend to keep the faith with them. We indicated what we would do loud and clear during the election campaign. We do want to take this early opportunity to give the Senate a chance to indicate its view in relation to the part sale of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have concerns about the manner in which the part privatisation policy was presented. That is of concern to us. I point out that the coalition pulled out its rolled gold environment vision at the last moment in the middle of an election campaign and linked it to the sale of Telstra without giving the electorate time to digest the sleight of hand that was involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I happen to believe that the two campaign promises&mdash;environment and telecommunications&mdash;are chalk and cheese, except one was the political bait in a clumsy trap, as Mr Fischer said, to captivate minority parties in the Senate. Why did the sale of Telstra need bait? I suppose because without the environment policy no-one at all would swallow the privatisation of this vital public utility that delivers cross&hyphen;subsidised services across the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Liberals, I think, know that there is strong community opposition to the sale of Telstra and that Australians will not swallow the sale of Telstra. Labor is not going to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> swallow the sale of Telstra. We will respect majority opinion always and, I believe, in this respect we reflect a clear majority view and, certainly, a Labor constituency view in the electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think that anyone in this chamber should feel comfortable and relaxed about Mr Howard's promise that only a third of Telstra would be sold during his first term of office. We have seen already a clear propensity on the part of this new government to break the election promises that were made, such as the promise that only 2,500 public sector workers were going. Already we have got department heads hinting that not only will there be very significant numbers more going than the 2,500 indicated in the election campaign but, of course, now those numbers will not be from natural attrition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my own shadow portfolio area, we heard that all social security entitlements would be on the table after a clear and unequivocal commitment to maintain them. Another example is the maintenance of funding for the ABC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I think that there will be a great deal of concern in the community about the government's willingness and commitment to honour its election promises. The key election promise in relation to the proposed sale of one&hyphen;third of Telstra will be no more than just the thin end of the wedge, as will be the proposal of limited foreign ownership. I do urge the Senate to take this early opportunity to reject this proposal by supporting the amendment that I have proposed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the first tasks of any new Senate is to put in place its sessional orders, the last sessional orders having expired with the commencement of this sitting. In this instance, the new government has given considerable attention to drafting a suggested set of sessional orders that I think is both fair to all senators but also reflects the need and commitment of the government to get its legislation dealt with by this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Honourable senators would have read the details of the proposed sessional orders as they appear in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>. In fact, honourable senators would have read them earlier because the basis of the drafts as they appear in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> was circulated to all parties last week by the Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Senator Kemp.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You will see that we build upon the past sessional orders and the experiences of the management of this place that have been gained over a long period of time. In fact, there are not very many changes that we are suggesting from the contents of the last set of sessional orders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most of these provisions, I would have thought, are not contentious in any way. We had a few contentious ideas but during the consultation process we actually removed them. So I am surprised that today we apparently do not have support from all corners of this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The first of these sessional orders relates to the reference of bills to committees. This is a good practice which was adopted some time ago in this place. It allows for an accelerated process of consideration of government legislation by committees and is as an imp rovement in many ways on the committee of the whole debate within the chamber. I think that all senators believe it has worked reasonably well. I think the legislation committees that receive the bills through this mechanism could do even better in encouraging the contribution of the public to the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the advantages of taking the bill out of the chamber and into the legislative committees is that the committee can then listen to the community. A strong democracy in many ways is demonstrated by the level of contribution of the community. Certainly, the interest groups that are based in this city&mdash;the professional lobby groups and the like&mdash;become aware of these considerations by committees and do contribute. It would be good if the wider public became better aware of the process of consideration of these bills in committees and were given the opportunity to contribute. I do not think, as far as I can work out, that there is any concern about reinstating the provisions for reference of bills to committees. But if there is, no doubt we will learn of it in the very near future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second of these sessional orders relates to time limits for motions and amendments to refer bills to committees. As I recall it, that is again reinstating the existing provisions. I have not heard any suggestion that there is a wish within the chamber to change from those procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third sessional order that we put before the Senate today is that which deals with debate on bills received from the House of Representatives, which is what we commonly refer to in here as the cut&hyphen;off motion. Over a long period of time the Senate has sent a message to the government of the day that, for it to effectively operate as a house of review, there is a need for legislation to be given adequate time for consideration and therefore orderly process and the orderly introduction of bills into this place is sensible practice. Unfortunately, Labor failed to appreciate that and therefore the Senate, in the past, felt that it needed to entrench that sentiment within the sessional orders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a different attitude because we in fact recognise the importance of the principle. Nevertheless, rather than get into a debate on <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="109"> it, and just in case our good faith is not totally appreciated by the new opposition, we are proposing that this cut&hyphen;off motion remain in the sessional orders. I do not think that there will be any opposition to that as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth sessional order is that which imposes limitations of debate in relation to motions for suspension of standing orders. That is a practice that has been in place for some time now, and I think that it has maintained wide support around the chamber. I doubt that there will be any concern expressed about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fifth sessional order relates to the powers of parliamentary secretaries. Again we have simply adopted past practices, so I do not think that there will be any dispute there. In passing, for the benefit of Senator Faulkner, there is an argument that it might be useful practice for parliamentary secretaries to appear in estimates committees in relation to portfolios in which the minister in this chamber has a representational capacity. Nevertheless, as we objected to that on the last occasion, we think that it is probably not worth while revisiting that now. So the proposal we have here is in the same form that was previously agreed to by the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sixth proposed sessional order relates to the speaking times for debate on motions. There has been in this place a trend towards encouraging shorter speeches. From time to time, we have objected to that; nevertheless, on reflection, I think it is sound practice. Whatever cannot be said in 20 minutes is probably not worth saying. Furthermore, there is always the option for the Senate&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Senator Carr interjecting</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We learn from experience, Senator. Some of us are prepared to concede that and recognise that we can all gain from experience. If the Senate was to adopt this motion, it would be a continuation of the trend that has been adopted in recent times of encouraging speeches to be limited to 20 minutes. So this motion goes a little further than the previous sessional orders, but it is in a direction consistent with what I think has been the sentiment of the majority in this chamber. There may be some individuals that want to argue against that. I certainly would <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not expect that the Labor Party would argue against it because they have been calling for shorter speeches for some time as well. We will await the response of the opposition and the minority parties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The seventh sessional order deals with broadcasting of legislation committees when considering estimates. I think that is in the same form as previously. I do not think there is any contentious aspect to that and I would not think that it would be opposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The eighth is that which deals with times of sitting and routine of business. The times of sitting in this place have always been a subject of vigorous debate and little unanimity. I have witnessed many of those debates over the last 15 years that I have been here, whether the Senate should or should not sit at night, whether it should start early in the morning, whether it should sit during the lunch break and what should be the terms and conditions if it does sit through the lunch break. What there is general agreement for, these days, is that the old practices of sitting very long hours into the early mornings is unwise Senate practice. As my colleague Senator Herron would say, it is bad for health. I think that all senators these days believe that that is the case, and I hope that that practice of the past will not be revisited. Certainly, it is not accommodated within the proposals that we put.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are suggesting that on Monday and Tuesday the Senate meet from 2 p.m. to enable cabinet meetings and the like to take place on Monday mornings and for party meetings to take place on Tuesday mornings. We propose that the Senate sit from 2 p.m. until 6.30 p.m., after which there will be a dinner break for an hour and the Senate will continue to sit until 10.30 p.m. That would be relatively consistent with the House of Representatives, which now gets up at 11 p.m. We have decided, on reflection, that two evening sittings on the first two days of the week would be sensible Senate practice. It would enable more business to be transacted, which is what the public wants of us. It would not require the Senate to be sitting unreasonably late hours. Therefore, we are putting it to the Senate for its consideration today.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="110">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On Wednesdays and Thursdays we are proposing that the Senate start at 9 a.m. and finish at 8 p.m. We do not think that that is unreasonable. Some would say that it is a long day's work, but it is not as if the Senate sits every week. We think that when we are here the Senate should be sitting reasonable hours, and that is not unreasonable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once the issue of the times is settled, there is the issue of the routine of business within those times. We have sought to protect the times available for non-government parties and individual senators. It is a very important part of the review process and of this chamber's wider role as a second chamber. We have also sought to provide blocks of time for the government's legislative program. That would be a first if the Senate agrees to that today. I think it would be a sensible reform. I would have thought that the Labor Party, which constantly complained about the time for its legislation being encroached by other business, would also come in here today and say in good faith that that would be a sensible reform. I look forward to hearing Senator Faulkner's response to that suggested change. We have designed this to protect time for the opposition and for individual senators and minority parties. We have suggested some block periods of time for government legislation, and I commend that to the Senate as a sensible practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ninth sessional order concerns the consideration of government documents. I do not think there will be any problem with that. Matters of public interest is item No. 10, which reinstates the existing practice. Proposed new sessional order No. 11 deals with time limits for questions without notice. That has been the subject of long and tortuous debate in this place as well. Rather than re-visit that debate, we have suggested a continuation of the existing times. I presume that that will continue to be supported by the chamber. The twelfth sessional order relates to the limitation of debate on motions relating to answers to questions without notice. I think those time limits will be supported. The last sessional order we provide relates to the consideration of committee reports and government responses, which I think is also in the same form as before.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will therefore be evident to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that what we are putting up for the consideration of this chamber for its sessional orders for this session is very much what we have had in the past, with just a number of changes&mdash;in particular, some changes to the sitting hours which we think flow from our experiences of recent times. When I say `our experiences', I mean the experiences of senators as a whole. The reform would give the government some block periods for the consideration of its legislative program, which would seem to be reasonable, and some further reduction of speaking times.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I therefore commend these new sessional orders to the Senate. As I said, they were circulated to honourable senators last week, so there has been plenty of time for the opposition party, minority parties and independents to form opinions on them. We would certainly wish that they be adopted today and put into place; otherwise, as I understand it, we revert to the old standing orders which were the subject of previous reform and therefore would be considered by most to be a less preferable alternative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In many ways this will be the first test for the new opposition&mdash;whether it is prepared to approach this debate in a constructive way, whether it is going to come in here and use its relations with the minority parties and the numbers that can be created through that simply to be a nuisance and to waste the time of the chamber, or whether it is going to say from its experience that what we are suggesting is sound and sensible and therefore be prepared to support it.</PARA></SPEECH>

With the cooperation of the opposition, we tried to work out what, frankly, were a number of simple procedural matters for this Senate. At the outset, Senator Hill, we actually are interested in working <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="111"> cooperatively with the government and the minor parties in the Senate. We are interested in working out these sessional orders in the best interests of all senators. That is the standpoint from which we come.

Now, not only do you agree with the contribution I made at that time and think it is a tremendous piece of Senate reform, but you are also actually looking to extend it beyond speeches in the second reading debate to a range of other speeches in this chamber.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not much care whether the process is a formal one through the Procedure Committee or an informal one around the table outside the chamber&mdash;I do not much care what the nature of the process is&mdash;but, as I have said to the government informally, that is the way to go and I believe we can solve it by the beginning of the next sitting week. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> That will mean that there will be significantly less time wasted on a whole range of unnecessary procedural debates in this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those opposite are now the government. They have changed their views and now broadly reflect the view that the Labor Party held in government and would not be hypocritical enough to change now that we are on this side of the chamber. We are willing to sort it out. We want to sort it out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Hill, in his contribution, canvassed the cut&hyphen;off motion. That does not actually reflect the motion before us because it is subject to a separate notice of motion. But I agree that it is an important issue. I agree that the sitting times of the Senate is an important issue for us to work through. I agree that the routine of the business of the Senate needs to be sorted through. I agree that it is dependent on the times of sitting of this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue of the length of speeches is important. I think the government mounted a very persuasive case about that. It might be a little different from some of the cases the coalition has presented over the years but I found it terribly persuasive. There are also some issues in relation to the Procedure Committee report, specifically in relation to estimates committees, that need a little reflection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I put to the government and minor party representatives in the chamber that, by the commencement of the next parliament, we should have obviated the need for this sort of debate by incorporating, where there is agreement across the chamber, many of these agreed sessional orders&mdash;most of them are agreed&mdash;in the standing orders. That would be a sensible reform. I would be happy to cooperate with the government to ensure that we see that significant step forward in Senate process and procedure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I suggest to the government that the sensible way of doing that is to have either formal or informal negotiations. I believe that by Monday of next week we ought to have an agreed position. If we do not have an agreed position, at least we should be in the position of ensuring that the areas of disagreement are absolutely limited to just a few issues.</PARA>

Everything you have done in relation to Senate procedures has been an appalling mess&hyphen;up. You have not kicked a goal in this chamber in relation to Senate procedures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You did not get your act together until the very end of last week. You know you could not provide to any senator any proposed standing order or proposed sessional order up until a day or so ago. It has been a pathetic performance. You were expecting a debate on this matter an hour or so ago. Senator Kemp blew that as well and we ended up on the address&hyphen;in&hyphen;reply debate.

I note that there is a minor change of wording in that particular proposed sessional order. That does not concern me.

There is the issue of the cut-off  motion, which you addressed in your comments, so it is not subject to this particular motion. There are the times of sitting and the routine of business. There is the issue of the limitation of speeches, but I must say I was convinced by the contribution you made on that. There is the question of participating members on estimates committees, which is dealt with in one of the Procedure Committee reports. There is the issue of incorporating in the standing orders all the agreed sessional orders and the issue of ensuring that we deal with an approach to question time which, unless we sort it out outside the chamber, will probably lead to some long&mdash;but, most importantly, unnecessary&mdash;procedural debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the approach the government is taking. The sensible thing to do, particularly given that the government has not got its act together, is to have a very short adjournment on this. We either formally refer it to the Procedure Committee or deal with it informally. I think it can be done informally, with the senators around the chamber. I think that will be a more sensible approach. Either way, in the meantime, I will listen to the advice of the government on what you want to propose for Wednesday and Thursday of this week in terms of routine of business&mdash;whether you want to look at some temporary sessional orders, whether they be the ones you propose <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="114"> or the ones we previously had&mdash;and what the standing orders envisage.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the sensible way forward and that is the way to get a cooperative outcome&mdash;an agreed outcome&mdash;that will limit the areas of dispute, limit the areas of disagreement and limit the need for a long and turgid procedural debate in this chamber.

I think it would really simplify the entire debate if we adjourned until 6 May the motion that we are currently discussing, as suggested by Senator Faulkner, but if in the interim the sessional orders in relation to all matters revert to those used in the previous sittings.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I actually feel quite sorry for Senator Hill. I have a file about an inch thick of his former speeches from the last parliament. Senator Kemp's is very interesting reading also. I will not read them out at the moment. I will wait until we actually come to doing routine matters. I suggest to Senator <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Kemp and Senator Hill that they go back and have a quick look so they will be prepared for that. I do not think I am the only one who has a file an inch thick like that; I think there are a few people who do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me just go through a couple of things that Senator Hill said. First of all, he said `during the consultation process'. This sounded as if there was a consultation process. The consultation process, as far as I know, was as follows. Senator Kemp certainly did try very hard. He had a paper which was very well written and informative, and he did come around and discuss that with me. That was consultation, and I thank him for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there is one thing that we in this chamber should have learnt from the last session of parliament, it is that, if we want to get something that will work, we have to have general agreement. I think that the current government probably knows as well as anybody that, if you disagree with what has been imposed on upon you, it is very easy to destroy the business of the Senate. It is far too easy to do. Imposition with numbers is something that the current opposition, when they were in government, tried not to do, because that is exactly what happened to them all the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would rather that did not happen to this government. I would rather that did not happen to any government. The way to get over that is to have round table consultation, either informally&mdash;which, I think, in this instance, is the best way to go, because we want to do it pretty quickly, and I think we can&mdash;or else through the Procedure Committee. The last Procedure Committee inquiry into the days and hours of sitting had some very forceful evidence about long hours, not enough sleep and that sort of thing. I hope we will keep that in mind for any other consultation that we have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need a much more thorough and inclusive consultation process. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased to see that Senator Hill and Senator Kemp are doing a lot of reflecting and are benefiting a lot from experience. I think that will be to the benefit of all of us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We agree with a lot of the proposed sessional orders. As Senator Hill said, a lot of them are identical to the sessional orders that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="115"> we adopted in February 1994 after the last large Procedure Committee report. The first sessional order dealing with the reference of bills to committees was put forward as a Democrat motion many years ago, in the 1980s. It was Senator Macklin's idea in the first place. We still think it is a very good idea. It enables the public to have an input into bills, which we now all agree is a very good thing. So of course we are still going to think that is a good thing. The second suggested sessional order deals with time limits on motions and amendments to refer bills to committees. In general, I think we do have to have more severe time limits. Senator Faulkner has made that point already, far better than I could.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Debate on motions for suspension of standing orders has to be limited. That was an extraordinarily sensible sessional order. I do not know why it is not in standing orders; I believe it ought to be. That was put in sessional orders&mdash;like the first one on Friday committees&mdash;many years ago, I think in the early 1980s. We really should have that in standing orders. Why do we keep putting it back into sessional orders when we think it is such a good idea? Why don't we just put it in standing orders and, if it turns out to be a disaster in 50 or 100 years, we will change it again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have no problem with the proposed sessional order dealing with the powers of parliamentary secretaries. I do not personally have a problem with the 20&hyphen;minute time limit for each senator speaking in a debate on any motion. Considering that the opposition, which constitutes a very large part of the chamber, does have a problem with that, we should sit down and discuss it until we come to an agreement. The sessional order dealing with broadcasting is fine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The really big one that will need discussion is times of sitting and routine of business. We may not need a lot of discussion; I think we are getting close to resolving the issue. The main thing that the government wants is blocks of government business. That is a very good idea, and it was a very good idea when the last government suggested it. If I recall, it was the last opposition which thought it <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> was a bad idea. I shouldn't give this away, but I will: I said to Senator Kemp, `As you will recall, Senator Kemp'. He said, `Never say that to me. Say, "As you will not recall, Senator Kemp"'. That was very nice of him. That is a lovely sense of humour, and I enjoy it. As anyone who reads <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> will recall, the current government thought it was a bad idea. I still think it is a good idea. I understand that the current opposition, which thought it was a good idea in the past, still thinks it is a good idea.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not quite sure that we need a quarter as much time again of the time we had for possible government business time. If the opposition, the Democrats, the Greens and Senator Harradine do not find the opportunities to disrupt the business, the same amount&mdash;or even a bit more&mdash;of government business in blocks will mean that the government actually gets more done. Perhaps it is a good idea. I think we should talk about it. That is the point: we should talk about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we don't come to some agreement today, we will revert to standing orders. Those standing orders are from a considerable time away; we have been working under quite different sessional orders since February 1994. When I suggested in the meeting of the Procedure Committee before the end of the last Parliament that we maintain the 1994 sessional orders, no-one would agree. We ought to consider going back to the 1994 sessional orders and working under those. This is only until Monday. I was going to say that I don't know why we are having this debate in the chamber and not outside, but I guess there is not an awful lot else to do in the chamber. So it is fair enough really.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Faulkner said that this morning was one of the greatest shemozzles the Senate has ever had. That is going a bit far. It is very often not the government's fault when there is a shemozzle. When there seems to be total anarchy in the chamber, it is in fact due to a collection of motives from different people across the chamber. I do not think the government can be blamed for shemozzles. This government was  until very recently in opposition; I think they understand as well as <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="116"> anybody that oppositions can cause shemozzles just as easily as governments can.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the very short time available before we rise for lunch, I will make a couple of very brief points. There was an attempt, which I think Senator Bourne mentioned, to put forward the government's position and to seek views. The consultations have been informal, with some senators being immediately forthcoming with their views and others wanting to take some time. There has been an attempt to put forward the government's position so that we could receive the views of the opposition, the minor parties and the independents. This debate has so far shown that we seem to be in blazing agreement. I think I heard the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Faulkner, say that he agrees with 95 per cent of the government's proposal. Agreement has not been reached on the precise sitting times and there are some issues arising in relation to the routine of government business. Those are the matters which still seem to be outstanding, but there has been an attempt to seek agreement.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to Senator Hill as Leader of the Government in the Senate. Does your government stand by the statements made by the now Prime Minister on 19 February this year that, if it comes to the point between breaking election promises and running a budget deficit, you will stand by your promises?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. The opposition has a nerve to ask us a question about broken promises. When in government this opposition made an art form of broken promises. The worst aspect about it was that it was then a government which had no intention of ever keeping its promises. When your government went to the people in 1993 and promised that there would be no increase in taxation, you had no intention of keeping that promise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is that attitude and disrespect for the Australian people that played a big part in their determination that you were no longer fit to govern. Despite your promise, when you got back into government, having misled the people, what did you do? Up went indirect taxes, up went wine taxes and up went fuel taxes&mdash;leaded and unleaded fuel. The tax on fuel put a special and extra burden on the less well off in the Australian community, and so it went on.</PARA>
<PARA>But, in order to answer your question specifically, the difference is that this is a government which is committed to keeping its promises. We think that that is important. We <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="117"> made specific promises to small business, we made specific promises to families, we made specific promises to the battlers, specific promises on health and specific promises to the elderly, and it is our intention to rebuild the respect of the Australian people that you forfeited.</PARA></ANSWER>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find it incredible that the former minister has asked such a question so early in the life of the new government, but I welcome it. When you see what the former government did to efficiency in the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australian economy, when it deliberately set about avoiding taking the hard decisions to get our nation competitive again and when it broke every promise that it gave to the Australian people, you would think it extraordinary for this former minister to ask a question so far in advance of when he knows he will get a decision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget will be delivered on 20 August. It will not be delivered before then. There is a very wide range of issues that need to be looked at in the course of the budget context. That task has been made much more difficult because of the absolute deceit of the former government in the run&hyphen;up to the election. It said that the budget was in surplus. It said that the forward estimates showed that we had surpluses in the years ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Right through the election campaign, from the former Prime Minister down, that deceitful government refused to come clean with the Australian people, to open the books and to show the true state of the budget situation of which it knew perfectly well, given that the information was available to the incoming government two days later. You left Australia with an $8 billion black hole, a black hole created by your government and reinforced by the now Leader of the Opposition. That deceit was one of the basic reasons why the Australian people lost faith in you as a government and why you were thrown out so unceremoniously at the last election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For all of those reasons, there is a large number of decisions that will be looked at. They will all be announced on budget night and not before. Any views that you might have at this stage are absolutely speculative. As my leader, Senator Hill, has said, we on this side of the chamber treat pre-election commitments very seriously. We have already made that clear through the Prime Minister. We will be keeping faith with our commitments to provide assistance to those in need in our community, to provide the approach to government and the environment for government and the private sector to operate in a way that will restore faith, confidence and hope in the Australian community.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Short. I refer the minister to the statement made during the election campaign by the then Minister for Finance and now Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, that `We are operating in surplus and our projections are for surpluses in the future'. Given that the new Treasurer, Mr Costello, announced only days after the election that there was an $8 billion budget black hole, what can the government say about its predecessor's awareness of the real situation and Mr Beazley's credibility?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="121" SPEAKER="Short, Sen Jim" NAMEID="DJ4" ELECTORATE="VIC" PARTY="LP" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Ferguson for his very important question. It was obvious throughout the election campaign that the Labor Party was deceiving the Australian people and nowhere was that more obvious than in respect of the budget situation. As Senator Ferguson pointed out in his question, on 1 February Mr Beazley, then Minister for Finance, said, `We are operating in surplus and our projections are for surpluses in the future.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That assertion was never once rebutted by any of the former government ministers during the election campaign. Indeed, the contrary was the case from the Prime Minister down. Despite that unequivocal assurance, two days after the election the new Treasurer was handed figures showing that the budget would be in deficit for the entire period of the forward estimates. For 1995&hyphen;96, instead of a surplus of $720 million, we inherited a deficit of $280 million&mdash;a deterioration of $1 billion. For 1996&hyphen;97 the picture was even worse, with what Labor had said would be a surplus of $3.4 billion in fact being revealed two days after the election to be a deficit of $4.9 billion. That is a turnaround of $8.3 billion in the budget bottom line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="122">  The deceit practised by Labor and Mr Beazley during the campaign was twofold, of course. The first was that they pretended that the figures were not available. Secondly, they pretended that the budget was in surplus. Mr Beazley deceived the Australian public during the election campaign and now he is trying to continue that deception by denying the legiti macy of the Treasury figures. On 17 April&mdash;a couple of weeks ago&mdash;Mr Beazley said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We don't accept the figures that have been put forward. This notion of an $8 billion hole is largely a fraud.</PARA>
<PARA>Yet during the election campaign, Mr Beazley said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As far as we are concerned, the Treasury estimates that we had in connection with the last budget&mdash;and they were Treasury estimates&mdash;stand for good and we stand by them.</PARA>
<PARA>Now that Labor is out of office, the Treasury figures apparently are not good enough for him.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The only fraud being perpetrated is by Mr Beazley himself and his Labor colleagues.In stark contrast, the coalition government will ensure that the Australian people will be fully informed on the Commonwealth's budget position at the beginning of each election campaign period, as we outlined in our proposed charter of budget honesty. Mr Beazley in the last couple of weeks has rejected this valuable reform initiative, which is further evidence of his lack of commitment to open government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So let there be no doubt about it. Despite Labor's efforts to conceal the fact, there is an $8 million black hole. Equally, there can be no doubt that the responsibilities for this huge deterioration unquestionably rest with the Leader of the Opposition and the previous Labor government. Labor deceived the Australian public during the election. It is inexcusable for them now to try to continue that deception.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Baume for a question that is long overdue and in need of a decent answer. Quite clearly, there are some people out there who have not been listening. The fact is that most other countries in the developed world went down this track a decade ago. They have not all done it because they have had budget problems of the magnitude that you lot inflicted on the Australian community. They have done it because they understand there is a very real benefit to consumers in having a more efficient telecommunications company.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What you have in Australia at the moment is a company that is facing enormous challenges. If you look at the measures of its performance and productivity, you will find that it is sadly wanting. I know that is because the trade union movement and you effectively provided a veto over a number of the actions that were needed to be taken, but we have now reached a point of crisis. Telstra does need to become a lot more efficient, and it will become efficient if it is privatised because you will start to get price signals. You will start to have people focusing on the bottom line and wanting to ask the hard questions to ensure that that flows.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are very significant consumer benefits that will flow from our package. As a result of the sale of one-third of Telstra, we will then be in a position to deliver a number of consumer benefits, not just the safeguards that will remain in legislation in terms of universal service obligations, price caps and the extension of the untimed local call option to businesses. You well know that all those consumer safeguards are there, so you do not have any concerns on that front.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What you ought to be concerned about is a much more efficient telecommunications industry. If you have the highest local call charges in the world, if you are about 30 per cent off the pace in terms of OECD measurements of performance, you desperately want a company that can perform and deliver benefits to consumers. That is why the scrutiny of the marketplace will make a very real difference. It will also provide an opportunity <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for Australian citizens to invest directly in the company and, to the extent it performs better than it should, they will reap that direct benefit and they will get preferential access to those shares.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The usual furphy about foreign ownership has been put to rest. There will be an absolute limit of less than 12 per cent of the company in foreign hands and less than two per cent in the hands of any one strategic investor. We are absolutely confident that the Australian community will respond in the way they have to privatisations of telcos around the world. That will mean that everyone is a winner from an outfit that has so much to deliver but has been shackled by your government over the years. Telstra employees will get a two per cent benefit and that is a major improvement on their current position. They will have a stake in the company. They will have an incentive to produce higher productivity returns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was also asked about the environmental package, which of course is an historic first. It is the best package that could be put in place for more than 50 years and it involves money being invested in the National Heritage Trust, which will enable $318 million to be applied to a national vegetation initiative to tackle land and water degradation problems, $163 million to implement the Murray&hyphen;Darling 2001 project and $32 million for a national land and water resources audit to provide the first ever national appraisal of the extent of land and water degradation. There will also be $80 million for the implementation of a comprehensive national reserve system to preserve Australia's biodiversity, and $100 million for a coast and clean seas initiative to tackle major environmental problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we have the combination of those very positive benefits and the fact that we have a chronic savings problem in the country, a problem which is identified by people such as Vince FitzGerald on a regular basis.

I refer the minister to the coalition election policy document called `Paying for our Commitments', and in particular to the table entitled `Environment Total Program Costs', which says that your environment policy will cost just $84 million in 1996&hyphen;97. Does the minister agree that $84 million spent on the environment next year is no $1 billion commitment, as you have been suggesting? Given that the policy says that this $84 million in 1996&hyphen;97 will be funded from the budget and not from any proceeds from any sale of anything, can the minister guarantee that this year's programs will continue to be funded in the August budget and that the government will not try to find even more thinly veiled excuses for spending very little on the environment?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

The question by Senator Faulkner and the question by Senator Kernot later about the government's projection of the so-called $8 billion black hole is the shakiest proposition anyone can imagine. It is tantamount to the Goebbels technique of the big lie.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The so-called black hole is a projection. As has been said by many pundits and by the government of the day at the time, any economic variable which will be routinely reported between now and when the budget is brought down will alter those projections fundamentally. We have already seen some of the economic variables come through, which have been a product of the fine economic management of the previous government. The most recent figure that caught the public attention was the low inflation rate that Australia had&mdash;a figure entirely due to the policies set in place by a Labor government. We know that things such as growth, inflation, employment and all of those other aspects that go to form what are the budget parameters will change dramatically between now and when the budget comes down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also know that at this stage of the budget cycle Treasury is notoriously conservative when it puts forward projections. No economic writer in Australia is convinced at all that what the government is saying is true about that alleged so-called deficit. What we have is the shakiest of figures on the flimsiest of grounds on the remotest of evidence being used as justification for a slash/burn economic <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> policy across the board. We have ministers of the government going on the public record saying to lobby groups and interest groups that what they are proposing to do they admit is not good policy. In fact, Mr Moore said that with respect to  industry policy recently. He said, `What we are proposing to do will not be good policy but we nonetheless need to make these cuts.' He then trotted out this hoary old chestnut of the so-called black hole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first thing that needs to be said about this is that that is not true. It is supposition and speculation which everyone knows will change. The second thing that ought to be said is that it is indeed a derogation of the government's position in the election campaign. Towards the end of the election campaign honourable senators in this place will remember at a press conference that the now Prime Minister, then Leader of the Opposition, John Howard, was asked an extraordinarily pertinent question by one of the journalists. He was asked whether he would still deliver on his election promises if the deficit that he believed at that point did exist in the budget or whether he would weasel out of those election promises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Howard was forthright in his answer, and we ought to remember what that answer was because this opposition will be making it public at every possible opportunity. When asked whether, if the deficit were real, he would weasel out he said no, he would deliver on his policies and on his promises&mdash;yes, yes, yes, he would deliver. Now we see a major campaign of background briefing, of leaks, of innuendo and of on the record comments by government ministers that many of the undertakings and programs that were declared sacrosanct by the then opposition during the election campaign will now be cut.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had allegations and stories of cuts in the ABC. We have had stories of cuts in industry policy. We have had massive cuts to the number of staff in the public sector. We have had Senator Newman saying that every welfare program is on the table for cuts. We know that education funding is under review and is likely to be cut. We know that in the health area the razor is out and being stropped to find cuts there when the coalition was <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="131"> clearly on the record, particularly in their campaign advertising, as saying that the welfare vote would be kept intact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have, with the most extraordinary and unbelievably grotesque manipulation of language that I have ever heard of, cuts in the employment area. While the then opposition, the present government, claimed that unemployment was a key priority, we now have projections of cuts to the employment programs which would have helped Australians to take worthwhile jobs in the workplace.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A memo from Mr Blount last November contained the horrific forecast that unless there were significant efficiencies&mdash;significant cuts in employment, for example&mdash;there would be a $1 billion blow&hyphen;out in Telstra's negative cash flow. We did not realise at the time that the cash flow was already projected to be half a billion dollars in deficit compared with the very significant positive cash flow the year before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen employment in Telstra blow out to something like 96,000 as against 60,000, a level competitive with comparable overseas organisations and a level which, I understand, is some kind of target. That indicates present over&hyphen;employment of something like 30,000 people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the previous government there was a massive mishandling of Telstra. We have seen in Senate committee hearings an arrogance by senior Telstra officials in refusing to deal properly with senators' questions. Quite frankly, the previous government was only too happy to see that take place. There was no serious attempt by the previous government to make Telstra accountable either to itself or, in particular&mdash;this is why it affects this Senate&mdash;to the Senate committees inquiring into the expenditure of Australian taxpayers' money. Those opposite may well say, `Ah, but Telstra does not spend taxpayers' money'. It simply happens to have massive guarantees; it has massive contingent liabilities, which it was very reluctant to come clean about before the Senate committees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra was mishandled and mismanaged by the previous government, so there is a clear, evident need for greater efficiency. Most senators on most sides of this chamber would be well aware of the fact that in many instances people with quite proper complaints against Telstra have had a disgraceful response from Telstra. There has been a level of legal deviousness which is simply unacceptable. Apparently this has been motivated not by decency or fairness but by totally non-commercial attempts to protect backsides. People have made mistakes and no-one wants to admit it. In a typical bureaucratic way, the motive is to protect the backside rather than </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA>face up to the commercial reality that they have done damage to Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am overjoyed to hear that the minister, Senator Alston, is keen to ensure that Telstra becomes much more aware of commercial reality, that it becomes much more motivated by commercial decisions and that it becomes determined to provide a better service to Australians at cheaper rates. Privatisation of one-third of Telstra is an effective way of seeking to ensure that it do so. That is what that element of the government's policy is all about. I commend the minister for his continuing determination to proceed in that way.</PARA></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not going to speak on Senator Baume's motion but, after hearing his five&hyphen;minute contribution and his description of Telstra, I feel that, for the public record, certain matters ought to be addressed. He has described the performance of a company that bears no relationship to the performance of Telstra in recent years in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is odd that Senator Baume would attempt to ruin and downplay the reputation of the company which his government is trying to sell one&hyphen;third of, a company for which it is hoping to get the best possible price. If anyone in the marketplace thinking of buying Telstra listened to the remarks of Senator Baume, they would most certainly discount the price of $8 billion. In a very irresponsible way, he described this company as basically being hopeless, debt ridden, et cetera. That is not the record of this company. This company, which is owned by the taxpayers of Australia, last year employed full&hyphen;time approximately 75,000 people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new government is complaining about the lack of job opportunities in Australia and says it is going to do something about that. It appears from Senator Baume's remarks that, without rhyme or reason, the government wants to dismiss a lot of workers from Telstra. They would then go on to the unemployment list. There is an inconsistency there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the financial performance of Telstra. In 1994-95 it had a revenue of $14 billion. The half&hyphen;yearly report for this year indicates a revenue of $7.6 billion. If that amount is duplicated in the second half of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="133"> year, the total revenue for 1995-96 will be over $15 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at Telstra's profit before tax. What an extraordinary figure this is&mdash;and Senator Baume complains that the company is not performing. In 1994&hyphen;95 there was a before tax profit of $2.4 billion. The half yearly figure for the present financial year is $1.8 billion. That shows an increase on last year's profit before tax. Last financial year there was a $1,700 million profit after tax. For the six months of this financial year, there is an after tax profit of $1,200 million. Again, that is a significant increase. Last year there was a dividend to the taxpayers of Australia of $944 million. For the first half of this year, that figure is $686 million. Again, if that figure is duplicated for the rest of the year, there will be an increase in the amount of dividend to the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about creating investment in Australia? Last financial year this company spent $3.2 billion. Anyone who knows anything about Telstra will know that, overwhelmingly, that was spent in buying services and products from the small business sector, helping the small business sector grow. Senator Baume has bagged Telstra for not performing. If Telstra did not exist, small business would not get that sort of assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra paid income tax of $649 million, separate from its dividend in 1994-95, to the Australian Taxation Office, which goes into revenue for the Australian people. Telstra's total payments to the government in 1994-95 came to $2.7 billion. This government wants to sell one&hyphen;third of Telstra for $8 billion, yet in one year the Australian government got $2.7 million in revenue. If part of Telstra were privatised, the government would still get income tax. But overall Telstra is performing very well; it is returning substantial dividends.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will finish my remarks on a point that Senator Baume only alluded to. Once you sell a third of Telstra, it will not be long before you sell the lot. That is quite clear. At press conferences during the election campaign, the current Prime Minister (Mr Howard) could not rule out the fact that, in the end, the whole of Telstra would be sold.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the $2.7 billion total payments to the state after tax is taken out, or about $2 billion back to the federal government, would disappear. In four years we would be earning more than you would get for a third of the sale. I do not know what you would try to get for the full sale, but it would probably be the biggest float this country has ever seen. Whether you would ever raise $16 billion to $20 billion out of Australia&mdash;unless you sold a majority overseas to raise that sort of money&mdash;it is hard to believe. Of course you would not be game to tell the Australian people that you put Telstra into foreign hands. The remarks of Senator Baume have been quite damaging to the performance of a company owned by the Australia people. This is one reason why we will not have a bar of the hypocrisy of the government in trying to destroy Telstra, which performs a great public service to the Australian people.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron), to a question without notice asked by Senator Tierney today, relating to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission.</PARA>
<PARA>I am glad that Senator Herron spelt out his agenda for returning accountability to ATSIC. For quite a while at least $2 billion worth of government funding per year has been going to ATSIC and ATSIC related bodies. For at least three years that I know of, there has been a total lack of accountability in ATSIC. I have expressed that concern in this chamber time and time again. For some reason&mdash;perhaps it was political correctness&mdash;the former government chose to ignore this lack of accountability time and time again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When these matters were raised in the Senate, by the Australia media and by Aborigines who were missing out on $2 billion of Australian taxes which were supposedly going into causes such as health, housing and education, the former government completely ignored the situation. The former minister for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="134"> Aboriginal affairs, who is now no longer a member of the House of Representatives, chose to ignore it as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Time and time again I raised this with him, but he took not one iota of notice. He would not look into that issue of accountability, and as a result the money was wasted around those communities and not necessarily within those communities. That is what happened. Mr Tickner refused to have anything to do with an inquiry. So things went on. Senator Herron has had to take immediate action to look into what has been happening. I congratulate him for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam Deputy President, you may remember that in August 1993, I moved for an inquiry into the accountability of ATSIC and ATSIC related bodies. I had not convinced the government of course, but I had convinced the Democrats and their leader, Senator Kernot, to support me on such a move. The issue was supposed to be debated on a Thursday. It was the same day that the book about women in parliament was released. With the amount of business that went on that day, we did not get to my motion. By the following Tuesday, the Democrats, who cannot hold the line for more than 24 hours, retracted their support. That was nearly three years ago. That inquiry would have saved a lot of time for Senator Herron now. No one will know what could have been done if that inquiry had been undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think I know what could have been done. There would be far more accountability now than there was then. Of course, a lot of money would have been saved that should have been going to the right causes&mdash;health, housing and education. I believe that the former government should stand condemned for refusing to look at something that was obvious. I believe that the former minister, Mr Tickner, made a grave error. I will not condemn him now because he has got enough to worry about. He himself will know that he made a mistake.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats have a motto&mdash;I do not like to hear it in this chamber, but I will repeat it just once, Senator Evans. It is: keep the bastards honest. What did they do? They let me down at the last minute and the lack of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> accountability continued for a further 2&half; years, almost three years.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston), to a question without notice asked by Senator Schacht today, relating to funding for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA>Today in question time, I clearly asked Senator Alston a question based on the coalition's policy speech of 18 January entitled `Better broadcasting'. In unequivocal terms, the coalition, now the government, said that it would maintain existing levels of Commonwealth funding to the ABC.</PARA>
<PARA>The policy speech stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will continue to support triennial funding which has allowed the ABC to plan for the future with a greater degree of financial certainty.</PARA>
<PARA>Today in question time Senator Alston used every null and verbal device to get around saying yes or no to that commitment. He suggested that there were inefficiencies in the ABC and that those inefficiencies would provide savings, et cetera, but he would not actually reconfirm the commitment to continuing the triennial funding and at the end waffled off on something about the budget being considered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite clearly, the supporters in the broad Australian community of the ABC now have it on record that the funding for the ABC is under threat across the board. The suggestion that has been speculated in the press that a two per cent efficiency dividend will be applied this year to training and funding, which would save about $10 million, is now the minimum available. Senator Alston would not even commit himself to that figure being the maximum they would take out of the ABC. He went on to talk about general inefficiencies in the ABC and most of us can take that as a code of words to say, `This means we can slash and burn in areas of the ABC.'</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="135">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I draw the attention of the Senate to the public document of 18 January, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Better broadcasting</EMPHASIS>. All through the document the coalition committed itself to maintaining all the existing programs and services of the ABC whether it was television or radio, whether it was in the capital cities or regional Australia, whether it was the orchestras or other artistic ventures successfully conducted by the ABC. Now it is quite clear that all of that is at risk, not just from the two per cent efficiency cut&mdash;$10 million&mdash;but from other areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I think would worry many Australians is that some people in this coalition government will not be able to resist the temptation to try to run a political test across the programming of the ABC; those programs that from time to time put views and enable people to put views that the coalition would disagree with would be under threat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This move would very much equate with what happened after 1975 when the Fraser coalition government was elected and Sir Henry Bland was appointed chair of the ABC with the task of cutting, slashing and burning the funding of the ABC and turning it around to be less antagonistic in the perception of the then coalition. We saw the ABC go into several years of turmoil in programming, funding and very low morale. One of the most important communication institutions in Australia that provides a service right across Australia to areas that the commercial broadcasting services do not reach, cannot reach or do not wish to reach was affected very badly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It appears&mdash;and I qualify that it appears&mdash;that Senator Alston may be starting down that same road because he would not back his own promise from the election campaign that the funding would be maintained. Back in 1975 Malcolm Fraser promised not to cut the funding to the ABC but when he got into government he did things quite differently. I call on the supporters of the ABC, those millions of Australians right across this country, to be aware that the institution on which they rely heavily for their information and for a diversity of views is now going to be under a funding threat from this government because Senator Alston today in this <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> chamber would not reconfirm a very simple commitment he gave on 18 January.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On behalf of the opposition, I can assure the Australian people that we will fight this ABC funding issue through this chamber and in the community leading up to the next budget. If the coalition is stupid enough to cut the funds, we will fight afterwards in the Australian community to defend the ABC funding. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The format currently in use for bills introduced into this parliament has evolved gradually since 1901. It is only in the last 10 years or so, however, that attention has been paid to the effect on readers of the format in which legislation is set out. This has happened in the context of a growing community expectation that legislation that affects people ought to be accessible to those people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The accessibility of legislation has several aspects. First, of course, the text of the legislation needs to be comprehensible to its intended audience. As well, legislation needs to be physically accessible to its intended audience&mdash;that is, people need access to up&hyphen;to&hyphen;date versions of current legislation, whether in the form of reprints of acts or electronic databases containing consolidated legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those who still use printed copies of legislation, which includes members of this parliament, the page design and layout of legislation also affect its accessibility. Document design is now recognised as a matter which can have a significant impact on the comprehensibility of documents and on how effectively documents communicate information. With this in mind, the Office of Parliamentary Counsel has undertaken a project to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="136"> improve the design and layout of bills, which will also impact on the design and layout of acts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The result of this project is a new format, which has been adopted by the office for future bills. The main features of the new format are these:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a substantial increase in the amount of `white space' on each page. This makes the pages look less forbidding, and this in turn contributes to the reader's confidence in dealing with the text.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">Running headers are used on the top outside corner of each page. The inclusion of section numbers in the running headers will make searching for particular provisions easier. The inclusion of chapter, part and division headings in the running headers will make it easier for readers to interpret individual provisions in context.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">Section and subsection numbers are separated out from the text to make searching for particular provisions easier.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">Vertical spacing, variable font sizes and different margins give visual clues to the hierarchical relationships between different elements of the text.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">The text of bills will no longer be right&hyphen;justified. The use of a `ragged' right&hyphen;hand margin makes text easier to read because it means that the spacing between words is the same in each line rather than varied, to ensure a straight right&hyphen;hand margin.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">All bills will contain a table of contents. Among other things, the table will show all acts amended or repealed by the bill.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">The first page of a bill will now be a cover page including the long title. The table of contents will start on the inside cover page.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Several bills were introduced in the last parliament in experimental formats. Now that the new format is settled, it will be used for almost all bills introduced from now on. The new format will also be adopted for reprints of existing acts. There will be a longer transitional period for reprints because it will take some time to convert all existing electronic versions of acts into the new formats.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to thank a number of people who advised the Office of Parliamentary Counsel during the development of the new formats. These include:</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">the tax law improvement project and the corporations law simplification unit, in particular the communications experts working with each of those groups,</PARA>

Although I do not have the figures before me, I suspect that&mdash;although it is for that entire financial year&mdash;the casino had not started to operate until some time through that year. I also want to point out that the licence fee from that profit was $12,299,000&hyphen;odd and that the community benefit fee was $1,537,000&hyphen;odd. I want to draw the attention of the government to those fees, if it has not already been attracted to them. My understanding&mdash;and it will be confirmed when I have a glance at the Commonwealth Grants Commission report&mdash;is that most of that money goes to the Christmas Island community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Christmas Island community is one which has received an enormous contribution from the taxpayers of Australia over recent years&mdash;a contribution that some people living in less fortunate parts of Australia might query. They may think that the Christmas Island community is being treated much more favourably than many people in regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I simply rose to draw those figures to the government's attention and to suggest that if those amounts are going to the Christmas Island community the matter should be looked at carefully. The Australian taxpayers' contribution to that community should also be carefully considered now that the amount of revenue from that casino has been determined, as is indicated by the annual report currently before us.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>I did not intend to say a great deal about this matter. This report is one which I believe will be forgotten quickly; however, matters were canvassed by this committee that ought not be forgotten quite so quickly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate will recall that this was a committee of inquiry undertaken by the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts References Committee into allegations made concerning the administration of Australian soccer. In the first instance you have to ask yourself, `What has that got to do with the Australian Senate?' Certainly, a point that occurred to me very early in the piece was that it did not seem to have a great deal to do with the operations of the Australian Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Issues were raised by a number of people about the way in which soccer was administered in this country. This was done using the media and through the Stewart inquiry. Changes have been made to the administration of soccer, but not as a result of the proceedings of this committee. In fact, this inquiry, in the judgment of Labor Party senators who participated in it, can claim little credit for the changes that have taken place in soccer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My concern with this matter related specifically to the question of civil liberties. It seems to me&mdash;it seemed to me when we were engaged in this exercise&mdash;that one of our prime functions as senators has to be to protect the civil liberties of Australians. Some 79 citizens were adversely named in the committee's proceedings and there were very few opportunities for those named persons to state their position and clear their names. This, in my judgment, was a very clear case of where sport and politics do not mix.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="139">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A very large number of sensational claims were made by media outlets. Many unfounded allegations and malicious rumours were made against persons prominent in soccer. They became a subject of public vilification and in my judgment they had no effective means of redress. I think it is important for senators to not confuse public interest with partisan political comment. There seems to me an appropriate place for partisan political comment, especially in here, but it is not necessarily the basis on which we launch vendettas against individuals in the soccer community or participate in a partisan way in the feuds that are occurring within the soccer fraternity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">David Hill, the Australian Soccer Federation Chairman, made the position very clear. He indicated very early in the piece, in April 1995, that `mud sticks in these things'. He indicated that you have a whole series of people who have an axe to grind and have a version of events. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I do not think that constitutes grounds for sacking a national coach.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As well as making decisions in the best interests of soccer&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the committee would&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">have to have . . . regard for the rights of individuals who . . . have been wronged in this . . .</PARA>
<PARA>He indicated that we have to also take decisions based on the best interests of soccer itself. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there are people who have appeared before this Committee who have . . . repeated some rumour they are familiar with. The people who have been branded have not been charged with any offence and have not had the opportunity to say anything.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>As members of the committee, we indicated from April 1995 that we felt the committee should be wound up. Unfortunately, that advice was ignored. We saw an abuse of natural justice which, in my judgment, went very much to the heart of our responsibilities as senators to protect the rights of Australian citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know it will be said that this committee provided an opportunity for people wronged to clear the air and that was often said. I would put to the Senate that none of us can be so naive as to believe that witnesses do not <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> incur expenses in retaining barristers and solicitors who have to advise them on the evidence that is being presented. Witnesses incurred considerable expense in giving evidence to the committee and had great stress placed upon them which was not attended to through this committee. Many grave charges were laid against them and not all people are able to respond adequately in a committee format. They are not lawyers and are not able to have lawyers speak for them. The committee system is not a court of law. This is a simple proposition which so many senators opposite failed to understand through this process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of specific findings there was no evidence found that Anthony Labbozzetta had done any wrong regarding the Okon transfer matter. There was no evidence presented to suggest that charges were found against individuals named. In particular, there was no evidence found against Tom Sermanni, who had been very badly wronged through the process of public vilification. It is important to highlight that Tom Sermanni was a highly respected soccer coach. In the past he acted as manager for a number of soccer players, most notably Ned Zelic whom he had managed for many years well before his departure to Europe. Mr Sermanni claimed, correctly, that he was frequently approached by young players concerned about their future. He had provided advice to a number of them without consideration of remuneration. He had been manager to a number of players and in one or two cases had advised or assisted players in obtaining trials overseas. There was no evidence of wrongdoing produced before this committee, yet Tom Sermanni's name was bandied about and his public reputation was put at risk as a result of some people within the soccer community playing politics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that this is an inappropriate use of the Senate and it was totally wrong for Mr Sermanni to be subjected to this sort of abuse. Equally, in regard to the allegations against Mr Ron Smith, that he had trafficked in players, again no evidence was presented to suggest that he had done anything wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On balance we have to ask ourselves what sort of actions this Senate should properly be <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="140"> involved in. It is particularly insidious to suggest, as this report does, that somehow or another there was a potential for conflict of interest. Every day of the week all of us face the potential for conflict of interest. The real issue in terms of public policy and public behaviour is whether action is actually taken which is in conflict of interest with our responsibilities as public figures. Surely that equally applies to national coaches at soccer clubs. It seems to be inappropriate and just wrong to use the Senate to attack individual soccer players in this way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to ask ourselves why people do this sort of thing. It seems to me to be a partisan political effort involving a dispute within the soccer community. It does not even have any implications in a party political sense and one has to ask what sort of morality is at stake here. As senators we can all have a go at one another in the public domain and it is part of our job to strongly advocate views and defend our constituents and the interests of our parties as we see them. It is wrong to involve people in the soccer industry in this way without the capacity to reply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think the Senate was well served by this committee. The majority report clearly has not demonstrated that there was a proper use of the Senate's time in this inquiry. In the end this soccer inquiry has produced the result that this committee is in the position of having even less credibility than the Stewart report itself.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak in respect of this report and reflect on where this debate was one year ago and where this Senate committee has in fact taken it. About a year ago the national coaches, Eddie Thomson and Les Scheinflug, administrators like Basil Scarsella and Tony Labbozzetta and players were all embroiled in a very public debate on the future of soccer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Carr quite rightly said, that debate should have been left in the soccer fraternity. The fact that it was brought into this place raises issues that we should not only reflect on retrospectively, but issues of concern in terms of how the Senate committee process needs to be approached in the future.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People were smeared at the time. The Australian Soccer Federation itself went through its internal process and, on reflection, the Stewart report&mdash;which the federation commissioned&mdash;was one which it and Stewart should have taken greater care in approaching and putting together. Some people were smeared and have had to live with the stigma. Last Sunday I was at a game and watched my team, West Adelaide, lose to Marconi and it was quite obvious that the history of all this was something that the game still had to grapple and contend with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I came into politics I was involved as an administrator for about 10 years on a league football club in South Australia and for almost three years I was involved in the West Adelaide Soccer Club in South Australia. There is nothing more certain in life than internal squabbles in sporting associations and clubs. Squabbles happen everywhere; they happen in cricket, Aussie rules, rugby&mdash;as we see in the courts&mdash;and in all codes. You often find people who want to knife someone else. The play <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The club</EMPHASIS> written by David Williamson was not just about sport. It was about organisations, politics and the fact that you cannot divorce one from the other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was concerned then as to the processes, and I still am concerned as to the processes that our parliamentary committees go into. At the time, whether it was the Hill-Negus group who were coming in to `clean&hyphen;up the game' or our national coaches or administrators, they were all lost as to how to handle the process. They were to appear before the Senate committee. They all had their particular side of the story, but none of them really was aware of the fact that when called they were expected to be here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They kept on saying things to me, and it came from all sides. It came from, as I say, those who wanted to push the new broom and those who wanted to defend the old systems. It came from the stakeholders; it came from the clubs; it came from the national administration; and it came from the reform group. This is what they kept asking: do we have a right to hear all the evidence against us? What sort of right to representation do we have? What rules of evidence are there? What <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="141"> rules are there against hearsay evidence? What about so-and-so, whose son could not make the team because his talent was not good enough? What right does he have to make allegations against me and not have them tested in the way that maybe courts tackle these matters?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was real confusion, as you would imagine that people not involved in our process would find themselves in, and there was real concern as to the state of rights of people appearing before committees such as this. I think there is a lesson that we have to learn here, and hopefully it is one that the Senate can take on. We need to spend some time developing rules that govern people's rights when they appear before parliamentary committees: the rights of individuals, the rights to be represented, the rules of evidence and the rights to legal assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the people we are talking about here are not and were not rich, but they could have found themselves, and some have found themselves, in a situation where they would have had to commission and had commissioned lawyers to represent them, to defend themselves on allegations which, in the normal course of events, would have been consigned to the dustbin of selection processes. So we really do need to focus on the rules of this place as they apply to individual citizens in our society, and I think that is one lesson that we should take on from here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One year later, soccer continues to grow. David Hill is at the head. Of course, he is having teething problems and administrative problems, as you would imagine anyone would have.</PARA>

It is curious to note that, in beating my team the other night, Marconi is at the top of the league and is going to be fighting out the finals.

It attracts young people and both male and female participants. It has more players than any other sport in this country. Okay, it has been built on the back of migrants from Britain, Ireland, Scotland, all parts of Europe and, in latter days, from Asia. It is a game that is growing in popularity, as is witnessed by the audience of soccer programs on both SBS and the ABC. I am looking forward to the day, though, that one of the major networks in this country recognises there is probably as much interest in soccer as there is in some of the other codes and actually gives it the kick along that it deserves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will finish my comments by saying that I do not want to pass judgment on the committee, on any individual or on the politics that were being played at the time.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I guess the proof of the pudding about this second report on Australian soccer is evident from some of the things that Senator Bolkus has just said. The administration of soccer has improved immensely. Soccer is stronger. I am glad to note that New South Wales is doing well, with three clubs in the top grouping&mdash;I just wish Wollongong was perhaps doing a little better. But one of the intriguing things about the negative response by senators on the Labor side to this report is that in effect what they did&mdash;and it was a deliberate action&mdash;was to seek to diminish the impact of this report on some grounds which they say are significant. It was a report aimed at clearing up what were some unfortunate aspects of soccer. It was aimed at assisting those who were cleaning up soccer <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="142"> in their endeavours, and they succeeded despite the efforts of some Labor senators.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should mention to Labor senators that at a recent function Mr Neville Wran, the president, commended this second report as being outstanding. He congratulated me for my role in it and said that it was an enormous help in fixing up soccer. Sometimes I just wonder what the motives are of some of the people opposite. I acknowledge, and always have, that in every Senate committee there must be appropriate recognition of individual rights. In fact, this committee proceeded with great constraints on it and performed, I believe, responsibly in recognising those matters. In fact, I will quote from the report. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's First Report received a mixed response.</PARA>
<PARA>We are now dealing with the second report, which is the subject of today's discussion.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gave two people a chance to clear their names. This is the key thing: their names and the names of other people in soccer had not been raised in a critical way by this committee in the first place, nor by the Stewart inquiry, but by the ABC <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS>  program, by an ABC radio program and by a magazine. The Labor senators are now pretending the attacks on those people came from us. That is the most ludicrous bit of nonsense I have heard for a long time, but it is not unusual because I have heard it over and over again. That is why I question their motives in this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those accusations were made repeatedly and the whole point of this committee was to clear them up. They were given the opportunity of clearing it up. By doing that, opportunities were then provided for other people, if they could, to explain why they made the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> accusations in public, in print, and to find out whether they were in fact accurate, and those who had not made those accusations publicly but had made them privately to some members of the media were invited to come forward to backup accusations that had been made in public. It is about time people on the other side faced up to the truth and stopped trying to blame this committee for airing these matters in the first place. It is simply dishonest to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I was saying, the committee was criticised by the media because there were no sensational outcomes. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . those who believed the process had allowed damaging allegations to be retailed under parliamentary privilege were outraged&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and some of their outrage was so synthetic it is just ludicrous&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">despite the fact that "in camera" hearings prevented the great bulk of unsubstantiated allegations made to the Committee going on the public record&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>we specifically catered for that problem by having in camera evidence&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">those who looked for a report that would, on the basis of conclusive evidence, resolve all the public and private allegations made over almost two years about impropriety in the sport, were not satisfied, as many potential witnesses who may have been of assistance to the inquiry chose not to appear.</PARA>
<PARA>No force, no compulsion. We did not subpoena anyone. I do not think it would have been proper for a Senate committee to have forced people to give evidence when they were not the subject of the inquiry. In other words, this committee acted with the utmost of propriety. It did it right. It avoided all the ludicrous accusations being made by some members of the opposition for unreasonable motives&mdash;I suppose `unreasonable' would be a parliamentary expression. They bear no relationship to the merits of this inquiry. I will read further from the report:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The great majority of witnesses welcomed the opportunity to participate and did so without specific invitation.</PARA>
<PARA>You would never know that from the comments made by the Labor Party senators opposite. The report continues:</PARA>

<PARA>As Chair of the Finance and Public Administration References Committee, I think it is very important that we take some time to examine the report and its implications. I am quite pleased to report to the Senate that, after some considerable effort in conducting the inquiry, the committee was unanimous in this report, its findings having been endorsed by all members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report should be of interest to all senators, particularly those in the new government. The introduction in chapter 1 tells us the background to the inquiry. I will not trouble the Senate with the first two paragraphs but I will draw its attention to paragraph 1.4 on page 2&mdash;it illuminates to some extent the reason for the inquiry&mdash;which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In October 1994, with the change to the Senate committee system, the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee identified <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="144"> service delivery by the APS as a key issue arising from the conference&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>referred to earlier in the report&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and resolved to conduct the inquiry. Additionally, the Committee was concerned at a number of matters raised by the Commonwealth Ombudsman in her <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Annual Report 1993&hyphen;94</EMPHASIS> . The Ombudsman's report identified several issues relating to service delivery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the Ombudsman may, at the moment, be having second thoughts about the wisdom of doing that. I think we ought to take heed of the function that the Ombudsman performed in alerting us to these problems. I think the recommendations that are at the front of the report are, and will continue to be, of great relevance to the Australian Public Service&mdash;in other words, what the Public Service is; what Australians expect their Public Service to do; and why it is necessary for the Public Service to serve the Australian public. They were matters that were considered by this committee and they are matters that are addressed in the recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of the recommendations may seem to have great irony in the very near future. For example, recommendation 1 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Special problems of small agencies be taken into consideration when applying the efficiency dividend&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I remind the Senate that coalition members on this inquiry endorsed this recommendation, as they did all the recommendations. I recall that that recommendation arose from the information we derived from visiting Launceston, a regional centre. I know that Senator Watson in particular&mdash;I am sure he will not mind me reminding the Senate of this&mdash;was impressed by the fact that these smaller agencies, and their smaller regional offices, were having great difficulty in meeting the efficiency dividend because they had been pared to the bone, so to speak. That recommendation will have the potential to have a great deal of irony in the very near future. I ask that coalition members of the committee, particularly Senators Campbell, Kemp, Minchin and Watson, to have a look at the recommendations to which they were party. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Recommendation No. 2 states:</PARA>

<PARA>I wonder what chance there is of that particular recommendation seeing the light of day in light of the developments which we are led to believe may happen soon with regard to our Public Service. I wonder whether the new government has even taken the trouble to address this report, which was available to it and which had been agreed to by members of the coalition. In the light of these recommendations, I think we should be asking ourselves, and the new government, whether there is any relevance in seeking information from the departments and from Australian citizens to allow us to reach these conclusions, and to see whether they have any relationship to the policies which we are led to believe could well be applied to the Public Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other recommendations may be seen to have a greater or lesser degree of irony. From what I hear of the plans, it is obvious that the new government has not taken advantage of this excellent report, which is the product of a great deal of hard work, not only by the secretariat and the senators who were on the committee but also by members of the public and the departments that took the trouble to bring to the committee their concerns and the facts at their disposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now draw the Senate's attention to recommendation No. 7, which explicitly says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Improved use be made by Department of Finance of evaluations lodged with it by portfolios, with respect to assessment of the quality of evaluation, disseminating information on best practice in evaluation activity, and in reviewing improvements in the quality of service delivery&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>If the resources of the Department of Finance are reduced, I think the department will find it very hard to disseminate what best practice is. I think it will find it very hard to monitor what best practice is. If the new government is at all interested in promoting best practice, I cannot see how it can even consider working in a direction which obviously contradicts the recommendation we have made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="145"> I must say in passing, though, that I noticed in a news report just recently that the Depart ment of Finance is responsible for initiating a venture into the Internet which lists new best practices and which provides information about them for other agencies to see and models to follow. But all that that does is acknowledge the Department of Finance's crucial role and the increasing importance of properly resourcing such central agencies to monitor, to recommend, to initiate and to implement models of good practice, and to apply models of efficiency through the Public Service. To reduce the resources of the central agencies is surely to fly in the face of that logical step which was agreed to as being important by, I would say, all those who gave evidence to this committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another thing which was very important and which the committee agreed to unanimously is embodied in recommendation 8, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agencies improve the recording of oral advice given to clients.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the reason for that is the notorious example that we have of a member of the public receiving advice given orally, taking action according to that advice or the interpretation that the member of the public puts upon it, and then finding that that is the wrong course to follow. That is a great inconvenience to the public. It is a great inefficiency and it requires a great amount of time and effort to be expended by both the citizen and the department to rectify the situation. That problem was common amongst a number of departments. We recommend that that recording be undertaken. Of course, that requires the devotion of some more resources initially to save time and to create efficiency later. If this new government decides to reduce the resources of our Public Service, such recommendations will be very difficult to follow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recommend that this report be a matter of urgent reading and consideration for those who have any interest in our Public Service, especially as it is a unanimous report.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>I was chairman of this committee and one of my great regrets&mdash;although one does not have many regrets about becoming a minister of the new Howard government&mdash;is that I will no longer be chairman.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This committee was one of the most efficient and productive committees of the Senate and I think it is a tribute to the Senate that the Senate committee system has evolved to the stage where it is now. When I look back on the last six years of my membership of this committee, I believe that there are two milestones. One was the committee report on breast cancer and breast cancer screening in Australia, which has become a template, and as a result of which there has been extensive improvement in the breast cancer screening process in Australia. It was the cause of an enormous amount of debate and ultimately led to the establishment of the Australian National Cancer Network. I think this committee can take great pride in the fact that it was the catalyst for that occurrence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We often underestimate the results of reports that are produced by the Senate, but I believe that this report&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">the tobacco industry and the costs of tobacco&hyphen;related illness</EMPHASIS>&mdash;is an outstanding report. In fact, it is to be adopted by the World Health Organisation as a template for what will occur throughout the world. Not only does it set a benchmark for the management of tobacco within the community but also it very clearly demonstrates the devastating effect of tobacco on the Australian population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I regret that there is a minority report. It is a paradox of the system, I suppose, that I am the only now government member of that committee who signed the majority report. The minority report was signed by my colleagues who held very genuine beliefs&mdash;I understand that&mdash;about some parts of the report, and I have no doubt that at least one <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="146"> member who signed the minority report will speak to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, it may well be that action is not taken on this report. Regrettably, it might be another one of those outstanding Australian achievements that is adopted by other countries. We may well fall behind the rest of the world even though we have produced a report that is even more comprehensive than that produced by the American Senate committee on the same tobacco industry and one produced by the United Kingdom.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am in the process of distributing it around the world. I have contacts through the various cancer societies. I am dedicating it to Sir Richard Dole, who was the first person to demonstrate in the United Kingdom the association between tobacco and lung cancer. Sir Richard Dole is now over 90 years of age. He is very active and still involved. He was the one who, 40 years ago, got 50,000 doctors in the United Kingdom to tabulate their tobacco consumption. He followed them for 40 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That report was the first comprehensive report. It was produced and published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">British Medical Journal</EMPHASIS> a couple of years ago. It showed that half of those 50,000 died as a direct result of tobacco consumption, either of lung cancer or many of the other diseases that occur: renal cancer, pulmonary disease, emphysema, coronary artery disease, and all the other diseases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Peculiarly enough, there is a connection with my present ministry because at the time I had no idea that I would be in this position. When that report was published one of the extraordinary things that occurred was an attack by the public relations department of Philip Morris. They wrote to every small business in Australia. I have not got around to thanking them because it was the first time my name got known throughout the wider community. They did not know that I tabulated all those names. Every small business in Australia got letters from us in relation to the campaign. I thank the public relations director of Philip Morris for letting me know the names and addresses of every small business in Australia.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of this present ministry, I just allude to page 107 of the report, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Western Australia, in the period 1983 to 1991, tobacco smoking was responsible for 13 per cent of all Aboriginal deaths, compared to 10 per cent of Aboriginal deaths being related to excessive alcohol consumption.</PARA>
<PARA>This came out through the research. Tobacco smoking is one of the biggest killers within the indigenous community of Australia because 56 per cent of Aboriginal people living in the Northern Territory smoke cigarettes or tobacco, according to a survey conducted in 1986. I would like to let the tobacco industry know that in this ministry one of the major projects that I will start is an anti-tobacco education program within the indigenous community because I think it is important, as documented, as it is such a major killer within that community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the report was produced there has been evidence given in the United States and there are class actions occurring in relation to liability of employers to employees within the industry. I was attacked by the Australian Hotels Association. It was interesting that the executive director of the AHA was the previous director of the Tobacco Institute of Australia. I do not think that was coincidental. I wrote back to him pointing out this problem in relation to the fact that legislation may well ensue in relation to the liability of employers within the hotel and allied trades industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we knew then what we know now about this particular product, of course it would be a prohibited product. As I mentioned also, the report is a blueprint. I think that the dissent that occurred will be spoken to. I welcome further debate about this particular report because I think that ongoing debate will ultimately lead to a consensus on it overall throughout the community of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the other members of the committee for their contributions. It was a very comprehensive report. We sought advice from many people. We had individual contributions put forward. Many witnesses appeared before the committee. Since its publication I have received laudatory comments from the Australian Cancer Society, the Australian Medical Association, the National Heart <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="147"> Foundation, the Queensland Cancer Fund, the Non-Smokers' Movement of Australia, the Anti-Cancer Council of Victoria, the Australian Council on Smoking and Health and the Northern Territory Department of Health and Community Services in respect of its alcohol and other drugs program.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a member of the Community Affairs References Committee, I would like to make a few remarks on its report into the tobacco industry. I congratulate my colleague Senator Herron on his chairmanship of the committee and the secretariat for what is a very comprehensive and valuable report in the main. I support most of the recommendations of this committee. In fact, 27 of the 39 recommendations have my endorsement as a member of the committee. I particularly support those measures directed towards the education of young people about the dangers of smoking.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am certainly no advocate of smoking. There are other measures in the report which are designed to prevent young people taking up the habit. I feel very strongly about doing all that we can to prevent adolescents from smoking. At my request, the committee has recommended that the states and territories investigate the feasibility of making it an offence for underage people to purchase tobacco products. I encourage the states and territories to actually take that action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take the view that we should treat smoking as adult behaviour. You do have to draw a distinction between the way governments treat adults in relation to behaviour such as smoking and the way you treat adolescents. I think governments do have a role in educating and preventing young people taking up or indulging in what is a dangerous and risky behaviour. The role in relation to adults should be somewhat different in a liberal society. I think the role is to do as much as possible to educate adults about the dangers of the habit and to ensure they know the risks <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of this particular activity, but at the end of the day the risk is theirs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On that basis, Senator Knowles and I did put in a minority report. There are 12 recommendations that we cannot support primarily because they seek to further increase the regulation of what is already the most highly regulated industry in Australia, regulation the like of which no other legal industry&mdash;and it is a legal industry&mdash;has to endure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am particularly concerned about the effect of recommendation 25, which seeks to reduce the number of retail outlets permitted to sell tobacco products. This is a Senate committee saying that there should be a reduction in the number of retail outlets. This would be devastating for the small business sector of our community. I think a lot of people are not aware of the extent to which the sale of tobacco products is a vital component of small business revenue. For tobacconists it is 85 per cent of revenue, but even for service stations it comprises 40 per cent of their revenue, for convenience stores it comprises 30 per cent and for milk bars it comprises 25 per cent. It is all very well for senators to sit around and feel good and say, `Let's reduce the number of retail outlets.' These are the lives of men and women striving in small businesses and trying to make a living under already very difficult conditions and they cannot withstand this sort of recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem must be treated at the source. Discouraging people from taking up the practice by education is one thing, but to actually seek to have the government act in an authoritarian manner to restrict the number of outlets able to sell the product is unduly authoritarian and not one that I could ever support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I oppose in particular the proposal that there should be further increases in the real level of taxation on this product. My objection is on the basis that there has been a 96 per cent increase in real terms in revenue from tobacco to governments over the past 12 years&mdash;a massive increase in the amount of taxation&mdash;and, of course, this falls on the lower income earning sector of our society. It is a very regressive form of taxation and one that is very undesirable.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="148">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">ACIL, the very respected economic consultancy, has estimated that smokers are already taxed $2.2 billion over and above their use of subsidised health care. So they are making much more of a contribution to the community than they have received from it for the effects of their habit. They are subsidising the rest of the community who are non&hyphen;smokers. I think that is unconscionable and I could never support a proposition for further increases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will not take up any more of the Senate's time. The majority of the recommendations have our support but there are a number that simply go too far in a free and liberal society and they should never be adopted.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As someone with an 18&hyphen;year nursing background and having been married to a smoker who died of cardiac disease at a young age, I feel very strongly about this issue.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it is. We had evidence from people in the industry that it was not addictive but that was before the recent revelations in the United States when the industry itself said, `Yes, we know.' That is important to recognise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like Senator Herron, I am also interested in the responses to the campaign waged by tobacco companies, such as Philip Morris, against this report. I also had a lot of letters from people who did not like the report. They thought they knew what was in it without reading it. They were going on the information provided by Philip Morris.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where I could, I made the effort to talk to people who had written or rung and I was amazed by their lack of understanding of the committee process. They had been led to believe that these recommendations were law. That they were not was a major point to get across to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They informed me about the need to restrict access to tobacco products. These were people who were selling the product. There were a number of reasons for that. Lots of small outlets have a very low tobacco turnover and those who were concerned about the quality of the product felt that the low turnover was leading to stale cigarettes. They therefore felt there should be rationalisation within the industry. It seems that every other industry in this country has undergone rationalisation of their outlets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was also a plea by outlets for support in enforcing the no identification&hyphen;no sale law. A number of people rang me and said they were sick and tired of having parents sending their kids into the shops to buy cigarettes for them. They were embarrassed about knocking the kids back and by the fact that parents did not understand the magnitude of what they were asking their children to do, which is to break the law. They certainly wanted support in enforcing that restriction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In recent times in the central west of New South Wales the health department conducted a survey of compliance with the law and found a compliance rate of 80 per cent. That is fine but it means that 20 per cent are not complying with the law. It means that 20 per cent could be advertising incorrectly or selling to minors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another issue regarding tobacco advertising which concerns me greatly. It is touched on in recommendation 25, one of the more contentious recommendations and the one that the industry and Senator Minchin do not like. It recommends as an interim measure the isolation of tobacco products from other products for sale in outlets. It is interesting to note that newsagents in New South Wales can isolate their lotto and other gambling sales but they cannot isolate their tobacco sales. It seems to me that if you can isolate your lotto <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="149"> sales you should be able to isolate your tobacco sales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That draws me to the issue of the juxtaposition of tobacco with other products. I name the Darrell Lea franchise outlets in central western New South Wales. Things may have changed in the last few weeks since the health department did its survey, but until recent times the Darrell Lea shops were selling tobacco as well as lollies, chocolates and, in some cases, discount ice cream.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not joking, Senator Bolkus; that is a fact. In a shop in Bathurst there was even an area recessed from the footpath, like a porch, with a mobile cabinet displaying tobacco products. That has gone now but following Easter, when the windows were full of Easter eggs in lovely, glitzy tinsel&mdash;nice products&mdash;there was a display window full of Alpine tobacco products. I have a problem with that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a number of newsagents there is a small display of cigarettes above the counter. But I have been into several where you look behind and see a very large, colourful display of cigarettes, right next to which are the swap cards. I have a problem with the close juxtaposition of a product that can be sold legally only to persons aged 18 or over with other products that are attractive to and attention grabbing for the younger people in our community. If that situation is not addressed then we will be doing nothing to overcome the problem of underage smoking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You cannot tell me that the chief purchasers of swap cards are people over the age of 18. They are not. I have watched them. They are young people in their early teens who, at this stage of their lives, are not able to make an adult decision as to whether or not they smoke. They are seeing a product which is absolutely next door to the product they are purchasing, which they know is legal and which they enjoy being involved with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The wrong messages are being sent to the younger members of the community. Until retailers and tobacco companies do something to address this problem, I am afraid that I cannot rest. I find it to be in such bad taste, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> I wonder about the morals and the efficacy of it. It offends me greatly that these products are being put next to products that are a great attraction to young people in our community. They wrap up and put in brown paper covers the explicit sex magazines. They can restrict the sex magazines, they can restrict the access to Lotto, but they cannot restrict access to a product that kills. I do not know what our priorities are in this community if we are going to allow that to happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge the new government and Senator Herron to most vigorously pursue this report and to uphold and agree to as many recommendations as possible or to address the questions that have actually been identified here. This is a real problem. A lot of evidence came before the committee. The problem that worries us now is that an increasing number of young females under the age of 18 are taking up the habit. They are taking it up at a greater rate than are young males. This is going to have an impact on health later on. We know that unborn children are affected by tobacco. We know that babies are affected by the inhalation of tobacco smoke after they are born. These issues have to be addressed. I urge the government to take this report very seriously. This issue is of grave concern and grave importance to the young people in this community.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What a pleasant change it is to participate in a debate in response to an opening speech by the Governor-General which is full of sanity, decency, integrity and hope for the future. It is a pleasant change after 13 years of what we have had to put up with, what the Australian people have had to put up with, particularly the false hopes, false promises and, regrettably, unsatisfactory outcomes. As was pointed out in this chamber today, we were left with a black hole.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="150">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government, having won an enormous endorsement from the Australian people, now has to put up with resolving an even worse mess than was admitted to during the election campaign by the Labor Party in government. As the Governor-General's speech, which outlined the approach of the government, said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is a society rich in resources of all kinds. We should not have to settle for a lower level of economic performance than other countries with fewer advantages.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what happened under the Labor government. Fortunately, that era has ended. This government's policies, as outlined, are to fulfil people's aspirations by rewarding hard work and initiative, and achieving rising living standards, affordable home ownership and a more positive future for our children. Let us look at all those things and the way we can achieve them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rewarding hard work involves getting rid of the nonsense involved in the present industrial relations system. People in this place who represent a clear minority of the Australian people claim that they are going to do what they can to block the massive reforms needed to the Australian industrial relations system. Apart from rewarding hard work and initiative, we want to achieve rising living standards. That is done by reducing costs and by providing incentives, which leads to increased competitiveness internationally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An interesting issue is affordable home ownership. Before the last election it was particularly disturbing to see that after a year or so of home ownership, young families all around Australia found that, as a result of the previous government's policies, they owed more on their house than it was worth. This negative equity was a dreadful blow to so many young Australians, many of whom found it necessary&mdash;perhaps because of moving for a new job&mdash;to sell their house. They faced losses&mdash;some of them significant&mdash;in doing so. I am not talking about mansions, I am talking about $100,000 houses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Fahey), my successor after an unfortunate break, made his maiden speech today. He said one of the striking things about the win in the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> electorate of Macarthur was that he won booths in what had been Labor heartland. There was disenchantment by people who had lost faith. They were no longer true believers, because of the actions of the true deceivers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It means that we have a specific duty to ensure that we take the strong actions needed, which the previous government failed to do, to protect the opportunities of these people, to make certain that home ownership is affordable and that the government's own actions do not damage the future for Australians the way the previous government's actions did. That is why it is so heartening to hear in this speech of the Governor&hyphen;General, stating the Howard government's policies, that the needs of Australian families will be placed at the centre of the national policy agenda. Small business will be promoted as a dynamic engine of our economy which can offer new jobs and opportunities to many Australians. In particular, more young Australians will have the opportunity to fulfil their talents through rewarding jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In looking at the achievements, if I can use that word loosely, of the previous government, what I found interesting was that, despite all sorts of promises and assurances and despite its attack on the 1993 coalition policy supporting a broad based indirect tax, the previous government had massively increased taxes on many of the vital products that Australians consume, without providing the offsetting tax benefits that had been promised in 1993. That dishonest campaign by the Labor Party in 1993 came home to roost. That level of dishonesty was simply unacceptable to the Australian people, and that is one of the reasons for this heartland rejection by so many traditional Labor voters of a party that simply let them down, lied to them, misled them and taxed them significantly on the very basics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the election campaign, I found that one of the most successful dodgers being handed out outside shopping centres was one which related to the huge increases in indirect taxes, in the face of the previous government's promise not to, which hit struggling lower income groups more than they hit anyone else. They were directed at the essentials <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="151"> of life. These huge increases were not as promised. They were exactly the opposite of what was promised in 1993. That helps explain the level of disenchantment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have mentioned before in this place the huge increase that was represented in some of these areas. For example, there was a 46 per cent increase in the sales tax on ordinary passenger cars after the 1993 election, when the previous government had promised not to increase indirect taxes. Sales tax on cars went up from 15 per cent to 22 per cent. There was a 30 per cent increase in tax on wine and cider. That was a terrific boost to the winemakers and apple growers, particularly those of Tasmania. No&hyphen;one from the Labor Party said anything about that in the 1993 election. Their sales tax was up 30 per cent because it rose from a 20 per cent rate to a 26 per cent rate. The previous government whacked up the price of food items like biscuits, flavoured milk, fruit and vegetable juices, cordials, ice&hyphen;cream and confectionery, snack foods and soft drink by 20 per cent, from a 10 per cent rate to a 12 per cent rate. And so it goes on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many people did not realise these taxes were there. They listened to the Labor Party talking about how dreadful indirect taxes and consumption taxes were and believed them. There were huge taxes. There is one group of items for which sales tax went up from 30 per cent to 33 per cent. That was an increase in sales tax of almost one&hyphen;third. That was on things like televisions, videos, watches, clocks, records, CD players, cameras and tape recorders. These sorts of things are what many people say are luxuries. Most Australians take the view that they are the normal things that Australians are entitled to have, because, after all, we are not supposed to be a Third World country, even though the previous government may well have treated us as such.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there are other things too. Sales tax went up by 10 per cent, unheralded, unsung, unpromised. In fact, the opposite was promised by the Labor government. It lifted sales tax from 20 to 22 per cent on items like dog food. Pensioners who had a pet to keep them company&mdash;particularly single pensioners <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> whose partners had died&mdash;faced these hidden rises. The reason I am stressing this is that we have a record of a Labor government which deceived the people of Australia with its hidden, unheralded taxes which it had promised not to impose. As against that, we now have a coalition government which has given a commitment to stick by its promises. This will involve a radical change in Australian politics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The response by the Australian people to that totally deceptive approach by the Keating government is best evidenced by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Illawarra Mercury</EMPHASIS>, which the Labor Party enjoys showing front pages of every now and again in this chamber.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can understand Senator Schacht's sensitivity. Those initials may well appropriately summarise his performance whilst he was a minister, in whatever vernacular meaning it may or may not have. This government has to face a situation in which the previous government, the Labor government, failed dismally. We keep hearing how the Labor Party is going to reconsider its approach to taxes. The President of the Labor Party is quoted today in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>  as saying that he thought perhaps they should have a look at a consumption tax. The article states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ALP President Mr Barry Jones yesterday added his voice to Labor calls for open debate on tax reform, saying that in the aftermath of its emphatic defeat at the polls, the party could not rule out a goods and services tax in any revision of its policies.</PARA>
<PARA>That is going back to basics, is it not? I can remember Mr Paul Keating, the former Prime Minister who slunk out of this business without facing the parliament after his defeat, was one of the first people to urge for a goods and services tax. Is it not incredible to see how flexible the Labor Party is on matters of principle?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is disappointing that the Labor Party managed to increase sales tax significantly, which is the most common indirect tax, since it came into office. It was a huge increase which it hid; in fact there was a 50 per cent increase in sales tax as a proportion of GDP since it came into office. At the same time, it was saying we could not have any indirect taxes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1982-83 budget&mdash;that is, the Howard budget&mdash;had sales tax collecting about two per cent of gross domestic product. The 1995-96 Labor budget had three per cent&mdash;a 50 per cent increase in the percentage of sales tax to GDP. But at the same time in 1982&hyphen;83 income tax provided 16.3 per cent of gross domestic product. It is now up to 18.4 per cent. That is higher than even in the Whitlam years. So the previous government was hitting the Australian consumer by stealth, yet at the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> same time it was resisting attempts to really fix up the tax system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one area of the tax system that I hope the government takes into consideration in its review of tax: tax expenditures&mdash;and I am glad to hear that it will be looking at equity and such matters. There is a statement before the chamber at the moment from Treasury dealing with tax expenditures. I hope that it will take into consideration the fact that there are some benefits in some tax expenditures. Tax expenditures, by the way, represent the cost to the government of tax concessions and many people find them particularly useful concessions for various reasons such as providing incentives, in some instances, for private sector activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is intriguing to note, though, that there has been a blow-out in tax expenditures over the last six years. Six years ago tax expenditures&mdash;in other words, the cost to the government of various deductions&mdash;were $10.8 billion. They are now $17.8 billion, something like a 70 per cent increase in just six years. Obviously, this is one of the things that will have to be looked at. As the Treasury document states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While most tax expenditures could in principle be replaced by a direct outlay&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>in other words, by a grant of some kind&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the tax expenditure estimates refer to revenue forgone.</PARA>
<PARA>Is it better, for example, to give people direct grants or to give people tax deductions? Clearly, that is a question the government will have to look at. There are many people who would much prefer to see things given as a direct grant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In some areas, like culture and recreation, there is a clear benefit in providing a tax expenditure; in other words, providing incentives for the private sector to provide funding for various activities in order to get a tax deduction. These areas are not large expenditure items. Tax concessions in culture and recreation now represent only 0.1 per cent of all tax expenditures; of the $17.8 billion that these concessions cost the government&mdash;in other words, taxpayers&mdash;culture and recreation now represent only $24 million, 0.1 per cent. Six years ago, they represented a whole 0.8 <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="153"> per cent. They have never been big, but they have declined dramatically&mdash;from about $80 million to only $24 million. At the same time, the total of all these other areas has gone up from $10.8 billion to $17.8 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The advantage of having tax expenditures for the arts is that it provides an incentive for the private sector to contribute to the arts in a way that the private sector may well not find interesting or attractive otherwise. A small concession by the government encourages a large contribution from the private sector. It is arguable that without the contribution from the government the private sector may find other ways of spending its money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are quite a few areas where great benefits can be achieved. Film is one that was overdone. As a result of the abuse of film credits, there was almost a reaction against it. There is no doubt that taxation incentives for the film industry, which have continued, but on a less generous rate, have been a factor in the extraordinarily dramatic success of the Australian film industry. I think almost all of the $24 million that is going to culture and recreation goes to film.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are other areas, though, that I would hope would receive a much greater stimulus, in particular funding for the area of sports activities. Not enough attention has been paid, in my view, to the capacity for people to contribute, through tax deductible items, to the sporting success of Australia. There is an organisation run by the Australian Sports Foundation, which hopefully, with the Olympics in Atlanta and the Sydney Olympics coming up, will encourage many people to take up this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make my plea to the government. If there is to be a total review of tax, and in particular tax expenditures, I plead with the government to recognise&mdash;and I am certain that the government will recognise&mdash;that there is some merit in some of these areas. There is no doubt that in many other areas&mdash;I exclude arts and sport from these&mdash;there has been an incredible blow&hyphen;out in tax expenditures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to quickly deal with the issue of industrial relations. The Governor-General in his speech said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The industrial relations legislation, to be introduced early in the life of the Parliament, will promote genuine co&hyphen;operation between employers and employees, provide greater scope for workplace agreements and give all Australians greater choice and more incentive.</PARA>
<PARA>I certainly endorse that. The Australian people endorsed that at the last election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many people go around the place saying that they have a mandate to do something. I would prefer to see it as a responsibility to do something. We were elected to be a responsible government. It is the responsibility of this government to make those improvements that it talked about clearly and openly to the Australian people before the Australian people passed their very decisive vote in favour of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Maybe the opposition will say that we do not have a mandate and that, really, all the Australian people were doing was voting against them. I suppose that that is a respectable point of view. One would expect most people of sound mind to take the view that the previous government was not doing a very good job and deserved to get beaten. The fact is that the present Australian government has a responsibility to deliver those reforms that could not be delivered before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite comments by even such people as the Chief Justice of the Industrial Relations Court&mdash;who said that everything was wonderful in that jurisdiction before the election, which was a fairly inappropriate intervention&mdash;there is no doubt that there are serious problems in that court and certainly in the way that the union membership matter has been conducted in the past. It would seem to me that as fewer and fewer people in Australia&mdash;less than a third of the work force now&mdash;determine that they want to be `protected' by unions, there is greater and greater need for a new system to be introduced that will provide a degree of effective protection for those people. I am overjoyed to see that this government is doing that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should also briefly refer to the Telstra matter, which I raised at question time today. It was alleged that my question, which was followed by my welcoming the determination of the Minister for Communications and the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="154"> Arts (Senator Alston) to make Telstra more efficient, was taken by the Labor opposition to be an attack on Telstra which would diminish our capacity to float it off. How absurd! What was being demonstrated was very simple: there is enormous scope for massive improvements in the efficiency of Telstra, and those efficiencies will emerge from its partial privatisation, because at last it will be genuinely exposed to commercial reality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously, it is very difficult for an organisation which has been an effective monopolist for so long to suddenly change into being a competitive force. You can see those difficulties&mdash;institutional difficulties, if you like&mdash;in the dispute about Optus and Telstra sharing cabling, about whether things should be underground or overhead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been revealed that attempts to negotiate by Optus were met with a pretty tough and brusque response from Telstra. Whoever was right or wrong, the fact remains that Australian society is having to cope with an unnecessary and expensive duplication of a whole set of cables, some of which are unsightly, because of an inability to come to a rational and sensible arrangement beforehand. I would hope that commercial reality will be a much stronger factor in future decisions of Telstra. Far from my damaging the prospects of floating Telstra, what I am demonstrating is that if past figures which were quoted by the Labor opposition showed a great achievement while it was being run badly, imagine what could be achieved if it is run well and if you get back to international standards in terms of employment and so on, and you have better work practices and a situation where commercial reality is dominant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know whether Labor members really believe the people who complained about Telstra affecting their businesses. Maybe the Labor Party does not believe those people. Maybe they think they did not have a claim or maybe they think they were handled admirably. If so, I think Labor Party senators who take that view would be in a massive minority, both in this building and among the Australian people. The fact is that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> there are improvements that can and should be made. I am overjoyed that we are proceeding with this. Of course, the results of the sale will allow one of the greatest environmental advances from a government ever made in this country. I totally approve. I commend the speech. I think it sets us on a path which will result in this government being the first of many Howard governments to come.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on this address&hyphen;in&hyphen;reply to the speech of the Governor-General. Of course, as we all know, it is not a speech written by the Governor-General. It is a speech written by the government&mdash;the Prime Minister in particular. I have been in politics for nearly 30 years. I have seen governments of all persuasions, state and federal. I sat here yesterday and I have to say that I have never heard a more uninspiring speech from a new government. One would have thought that after 13 years in opposition, we would have got something more visionary, more inspiring and more exciting than was dished up yesterday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does not matter about the length of the speech. That is not important. The Gettysburg Address, which I think is 267 words, is considered to be one of the great speeches of all time. So length of speech is not a determining factor of quality or of content. It was a short speech yesterday, but it is the content that really condemns it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I waited for an indication of some view from the new government of the practical measures they are going to introduce&mdash;bits and pieces of legislation, the odd privatisation and the odd change to industrial relations legislation. I expected that there would be some theme to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The one theme that I could detect was something to do with improving the competitiveness of the Australian economy. That is fine. Improving the economy is a noble objective. Certainly, if you went back and looked at Governor-Generals' speeches over the 13 years of the previous government, we also had the objectives to make ourselves a more internationally competitive economy, with more effective exports, et cetera. But there was no vision in this speech about the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="155"> sort of society Australia should have, other than a few cliches about inclusiveness, cohesiveness or anything like that. There was no indication of how that was going to be achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose one of the reasons why there was so little substance about policy in the speech is in fact because, to get itself elected, the opposition had to commit itself to supporting so many of the policies of the previous  government. It would have been too embarrassing for John Howard to support the continuation of the many excellent policies of the previous government in the Governor-General's speech.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will return later to some individual aspects of the Governor&hyphen;General's speech. I certainly want to return to the remarks he made on behalf of us all about the shocking events that occurred last Sunday in Tasmania. I do want to make mention of the constitutional convention that he will be calling and the issue of legislation on the flag. But as shadow minister for communications, I wish to talk about the speech and the government's policies on the privatisation of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I second and strongly support the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Faulkner. It is:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the following words be added to the Address&hyphen;in&hyphen;Reply:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When Senator Baume's appointment is made, one of the things we will not have to put up with is the sanctimonious remarks the opposition made for 13 years about political appointments. Senator Baume will be the ultimate political pay-off of the new Prime Minister paying off an old friend who stuck with him through thick and thin, the bad days and the good days, of the 13 years of opposition. I suppose maybe Senator Baume, with his previous record with Patrick Partners being a stockbroker and investment adviser back in the seventies, is hankering for the consul generalship in New York, where he can be close to Wall Street and may be able to see how people like Mr Michael Milken defrauded hundreds of millions of dollars from the shareholders in America and ultimately went to gaol for his crimes.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We will not have to put up with Senator Baume for much longer and, for many on this side, that will probably be a great relief.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The comments Senator Baume made about Telstra today in the parliament are really amazing and way off the point. He has talked down and bagged one of the biggest companies in Australia. He has tried to make out to the Senate that this is a broken down company that is inefficient and appalling and that it should be privatised to be saved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I pointed out in my remarks when taking note of Senator Alston's comments, this is a company that at the moment employs 75,000 Australians full time. Senator Baume wants to sack about 30,000 of them, if you try to read through his remarks. This is from a senator who made sanctimonious remarks about the need to reduce unemployment in Australia but is quite cheerful about the idea that up to 30,000 employees from Telstra around Australia would be sacked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Remember this, it will not be just the employees or middle managers at headquarters in Melbourne or Sydney that will be dismissed; it will be literally thousands&mdash;tens of thousands of employees of Telstra spread out across rural and regional Australia. I would have thought the National Party would be particularly worried to see the impact that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="156"> would have on employment in small and large towns in regional and rural Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He has bagged the performance of Telstra, failing to mention that in 1994-95 this company made a profit before tax of $2.4 billion&mdash;the biggest profit of any company in Australia's history. That is not a bad performance. Profit after tax was $1.7 million. The dividend to the federal government, to the people of Australia, was $944 million, which was on top of tax of $649 million paid to the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The total value added of the company for 1994-95 was $8.7 billion and that was distributed, which again points out the value of this company to Australia. The value of that $8.7 billion went to workers&mdash;employees' wages and superannuation of $3.9 billion or 44.6 per cent. To the providers of capital, $506 million went as interest, and $944 million, as I said, went as dividends.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Government taxes were 7.4 per cent&mdash;that is, income tax&mdash;and other taxes were $288 million. For reinvestment, $2.4 billion, 28 per cent, of that value added went in reinvestment. That is major investment for the infrastructure of Australia. It is investment that created jobs, investment that created growth for literally thousands of small businesses across Australia that rely on Telstra to be a major purchaser of their services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra has a policy of buying Australian. It is an industry policy that, when we were in government, we were proud to be associated with. We wrote it into the policy of Telstra and into our telecommunications policy. We have no indication from the opposition when they privatise Telstra how those industry policies, those guarantees of Purchasing Australia, will be maintained. When you start letting foreign owners in, they are not going to be interested in buying from the corner store or from an Australian SME. They will want to buy at the cheapest possible price. They will import the product from overseas, and that costs jobs. It costs the jobs in the small business area.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra has a purchasing policy, wherever possible, to buy Australian. You go and talk to Ericsson Australia, to Alcatel and to other major manufacturers and they will all tell you that they only exist in Australia because of Telstra's policy for the past 30 or 40 years to buy Australian. They would not be in Australia if it were not for that Telstra policy&mdash;a policy that goes right back to when it was a government department. That will all come to an end. There will be no industry development policy with the privatisation of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition has said, `But we are only going to privatise a third of it. We are going to privatise a third and raise $8 million, and we will only allow 12&half; per cent foreign owners.' We all know that will be the foot in the door. During the election campaign, on a couple of occasions Mr Howard let it slip, `That is only the first step. Maybe after the next election, if we are successful, we will look at privatising more of it.' We all know that once you privatise part of such an organisation the inevitability of the whole lot being sold will follow as surely as day follows night.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us not beat around the bush here. We are talking about the privatisation of Telstra. We are told that there will be limitations on the foreign investment, the foreign ownership, of Telstra. At the moment it will be 12 per cent but, when you go to full privatisation, the government would be looking at selling Telstra and getting a price of something in excess of $20 billion&mdash;the biggest float of any company in the history of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is said by many experts that you will not be able to find anywhere near the $20 billion in the Australian stock market or the Australian capital market. The only way you will get anywhere near that figure is to allow a large proportion of it to come in from overseas. Even though you may want to limit it, in the end, to get the money you want, you will have to raise the foreign limit and basically let the foreigners have as much as they want <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="157"> to get the price you want. Once that occurs, every time you make a phone call in Australia thereafter the money registers will roll over in Tokyo or Paris or New York or London. Those foreign companies will get the benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other aspect of the Telstra policy that the coalition has not talked about is that once you allow foreign ownership from other telcos in at any level they would not want Telstra competing with them in foreign markets, particularly in the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region. Some people have predicted in the next 10 years 500 million phones will be connected in the Asia-Pacific region, which will double the number of phone connections in the history of telephony in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should be in there with a big company, like Telstra, owned by Australians, by the government, to make sure we get a big slice of that action. Could you imagine that a Japanese owned company, an American owned company or a French owned telco would be very happy having an Australian company sharing with them? If they are a shareholder in the Australian company they will do everything at the board level to wind back Telstra's investment overseas so they have less competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those of us who have had the opportunity to see the impact Telstra staff have made on places like Vietnam, China, Indonesia and India with the development of foreign markets that are earning income for Australia would realise we have great prospects. The privatisation of Telstra, allowing other foreign owned telecommunications companies in, will restrict our ability to develop an Australian generic name&mdash;an export earner for Australia. These are important issues which the government has not yet addressed in the debate we have heard so far.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the issues the government has tried to address is cross&hyphen;subsidies and community service obligations. Senator Alston has been at some pains to say, `We will write in the privatisation legislation that we will guarantee community service obligations will be connected, will continue and will be subsidised.' I know, and anyone who has been around politics long enough will know, that you can write it in, but when a government five years <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> hence is a bit short of money and trying to raise funds it will say, `Well, it is costing us $500 million for the community service obligations.' Treasury and the Finance department might say, `Well, we know how to get you a couple of hundred million. We will reduce the community service obligations.' It would be put in the budget and through it would go. That would be a reduction. You cannot guarantee the community service obligations forever and a day even by legislation or regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The National Party, in particular, should be extremely worried because its constituency out in the bush will be the first losers when the community service obligations are wiped out or reduced.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We had an example of this only a couple of weeks ago when Telstra approached the new government, after approaching the previous government on several occasions, to say, `We want to charge for directory assistance. We believe we can raise $80 million in a year by handling the millions of phone calls that people make to get telephone and directory assistance.' That is provided free at the moment. There are sections of our community who need to have that assistance and should not be charged for it. The blind, old people and so on have difficulty reading telephone books.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We rejected those applications when we were in government. So far&mdash;I may be corrected&mdash;I have seen no public statement by Senator Alston saying that he is going to reject such an application. The reason I believe he will not reject it at the moment is if the so-called privatisation process is allowed to run he will want to tell those companies who want to bid for Telstra, `There is another $80 million of revenue coming your way. You can charge for directory assistance.' This will boost the price at the expense of the blind, the old, the feeble&mdash;those in the community who can least afford it. You cannot guarantee with a privatised organisation that all these community service obligations can survive. But there is even a wider issue than community service obligations.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="158">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because Telstra is a national network it operates a cross-subsidy to help, in particular, the non-metropolitan areas of Australia, Senator McGauran. Figures I have been given show that in rural areas of Australia the cost of providing a normal telephone service to ordinary Australians can vary considerably. I will use the electorate of Barker in my own state as an example. The member for Barker is the Defence minister in the new government. In Bordertown the annual access cost per line is $1,480. In Murray Bridge it is $460. In Naracoorte it is $1,650. In Kangaroo Island it is $2,360.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You cannot convince me, and you will not be able to convince the Australian public, that when you privatise Telstra and allow it to be purely market driven it will not go down the list and say, `We are not going to subsidise and lose money on providing these rural services in these areas. We have to make a quid for our shareholders.' Therefore the cost will start going up. Telstra will start changing the rates to recoup those cost subsidies from those areas. You will not be able to even out the profit, even out the national network, to have some informal cross&hyphen;subsidisation. Again, as sure as day follows night, the price will be jacked up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator McGauran, I will give an example from your own state of Victoria. In the Bendigo electorate, in Charlton it costs $900 for an annual excess cost. In Bendigo it is $480. In Maryborough it is $550. Again, the smaller the town, the more remote, the bigger the access cost, the bigger a privatised Telstra will start charging to provide that telephone service. These issues have not been addressed, and no matter how you write the legislation you will not be able to protect the ordinary citizen that you are supposed to represent, Senator McGauran&mdash;those people living in rural and regional areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> At the last election, we lost a lot of regional seats in Australia, make no bones about that. We got done like a dinner. I accept the result without argument: the result is there. If you are mad enough to continue with the privatisation of Telstra, and these people start having to pay something extra to maintain a normal telephone service because this infor mal cross&hyphen;subsidy ends&mdash;not the official community service obligation&mdash;then we are going to win back a lot of those seats very rapidly because people are not going to pay those sorts of fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You won a seat called Bass back at the last election. On Flinders Island in the electorate of Bass, the cost of annual access per line is $4,900. I want the new member, Mr Warwick Smith, former ombudsman for telecommunications, to go and tell his new electors, `We cannot guarantee that that informal cross&hyphen;subsidy is going to continue on Flinders Island.' And he will not be able to continue that cross&hyphen;subsidy under privatisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the issues. These are the reasons that this opposition will use every power it has in the Senate to vote down the privatisation of Telstra. We said all through the election campaign that if we had the numbers with other minority parties in the Senate, we would use them to stop the privatisation of Telstra. Because of the voting system in the Senate, that is how the votes turned out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it a bit strange that some now&hyphen;government members are whingeing about the Senate system, when for 13 years they wallowed in it like fat pigs in a big trough, saying, `Isn't the Senate wonderful? We can thwart the government of the day, the Labor government, in many of its measures'. We said clearly to the people that if we have a majority in the Senate, with the minor parties, we will oppose the legislation and defeat it. And we will defeat it even under the threat of a double dissolution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot imagine a more interesting campaign, as shadow minister for communications, than to go these rural and regional areas and tell them that if the coalition won a double dissolution, and got the bill through in a joint sitting, then on Flinders Island, the cost per telephone service would be $4,900. There would be no way that those people would not have their charges put up. I would love to campaign all around Australia on a double dissolution bill on the privatisation of Telstra. The Labor Party will not run. We will not buckle at the knees under the threat of a double dissolution. We would welcome it on <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="159"> this issue and, if the Government wants to take us on, we have been around a hundred&hyphen;plus years on these issues and we will be around to fight you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude with a couple of other remarks about the Governor&hyphen;General's speech. Yesterday, the Governor&hyphen;General quite rightly mentioned in his opening remarks the terrible tragedy in Tasmania and all of us in the parliament have shown how appalled we felt at this unbelievable occurrence. People are asking what can we do to stop it. I want to be blunt about this. Clearly, national and state parliaments in Australia have to take action to ban public access to these sorts of weapons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tasmania has the loosest gun laws existing in Australia. People there are able to buy automatic and semi&hyphen;automatic rifles. There have been stories in the press in the last few days about that. Let us be blunt about it, unfortunately, Tasmania has reaped what it has sown by not carrying out decent, reasonable legislation to restrict access to these weapons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a letter to the editor the other day, someone quite rightly pointed out that even if this man was mad, if he had turned up with a meat cleaver, a knife or a baseball bat, instead of an automatic rifle, he may have killed only one or two people before he was stopped. But because he had access to an automatic rifle, he killed 35 people and wounded another 15. It was the fact that he had access to an automatic rifle that led to the killing of so many people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The argument that we hear from the Shooters Party, and its ilk, that it is not the guns that kill people, it is the people themselves, is a fallacious argument. I say quite bluntly in this place that I hope that John Tingle, who is a member of parliament for the Shooters Party in New South Wales, recognises what his party has wrought on Australia by following these policies. I think that that party, and the lobby groups that it represents, have to take some responsibility for conducting a political campaign to intimidate politicians so that they cannot carry out suitable and proper reform of the gun laws of this country. I believe that the people of Australia are now asking all state and federal politicians to do <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> something about it. If the states do not take appropriate, reasonable action, then the Australian parliament should, even if it needs a referendum to do it, to ensure that there are decent, tight gun control laws in Australia so that the dreadful events last Sunday at Port Arthur in Tasmania do not occur again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we think this is an issue we can avoid, just listen to the remarks of the relatives of the victims. All of them are asking why this happened and what do we have to do. Listen to the heartfelt appeals of those relatives, particularly the father who lost his wife and two daughters, questioning how someone could get an automatic rifle and kill his family. That is a question that all parliamentarians in Australia have to answer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One last point I will make is that in this very mediocre Governor&hyphen;General's speech on behalf of the new government, a speech lacking vision, substance, and any indication of what sort of Australia we should have, there was one interesting proposal which is, of course, to establish a constitutional convention to talk about the issue of the republic and related matters. I hope that when we get the detail of that, we can see that it is a fair dinkum convention which can debate the issue. I know, Mr Acting Deputy President, that you, personally, will be keen to participate in such a convention, because you are one of those from the Liberal Party who stood up and said quite loudly that you wanted an Australian head of state, and I congratulate you for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another remark I want to speak about concerns legislation to protect the Australian flag. I find it a bit extraordinary, in one sense, that we have legislation to indicate that this flag can be changed only by a referendum or a plebiscite. You cannot do it by referendum because it is not written in the constitution. That is fine in one sense, but I wish Mr Howard had pointed out that, when the law went through to establish the present flag of Australia in the early 1950s, it was done by legislation. There was no consultation with the people of Australia. It was done by an act of parliament. Sir Robert Menzies introduced it. It went through with the support of the then opposition, but there was no consultation <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="160"> with the people of Australia. Suddenly we are told that though Bob Menzies could change the flag in 1953 or 1954 without consultation&mdash;</PARA>

It was a flag with a red background, not a blue background. The soldiers who fought so courageously at Anzac Cove fought either under the Union Jack or under a flag that had a red background.</PARA></TALK.START>

Those things were changed by an act of parliament. The flag was not changed by a plebiscite.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should also remember that the present flag was basically designed with the Union Jack in the corner&mdash;whatever colour background&mdash;with clear rules to say that it must have the Union Jack on it because in 1901 we still saw ourselves as part of the British Empire, an empire that has long since gone into history. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to amend the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1989 to ensure that Australia can discharge its obligations under international instruments relating to the control of transboundary movements of hazardous waste.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill 1995 was introduced to the Senate by the former government on 29 June 1995. At the time of introduction, a small number of issues regarding the amendment of the principal act were still unresolved. In order that the progress of the bill not be impeded, it was agreed that these matters would be further discussed after lodgement, and any necessary changes achieved by government amendment. As a result of subsequent consultation, a number of amendments were proposed and formed part of the bill on which debate was commenced and adjourned on the last day of the Spring sittings on 1 December 1995. This government notes that the consolidated bill represents the subject of exhaustive discussions with all interested parties. The package addresses the need to give effect to the relevant international agreements, and also satisfies industry's need for both certainty and flexibility. After careful consideration of the consolidated bill, the government, which supported the bill when it was debated last year, has decided to reintroduce it without further amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principal act was passed at the time that the Basel Convention was negotiated. At that time the major concern regarding trade in hazardous waste related to hazardous waste sent to another country for what is termed final disposal, that is for incineration, landfilling or the like. As a result, the principal act defines waste as material which has been rejected as worthless or otherwise falls within the ordinary definition of waste. As such it generally does not cover material sent for recovery. In the years since the convention was negotiated the emphasis in international debate has shifted to its coverage of materials which are traded for recovery operations; that is, for reclamation of metals or recovery of other useful materials.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Just as the trade in hazardous waste for final disposal led to an active process of transferring the environmental costs associated with the generation of hazardous waste from one country to another, and in particular from developed to developing countries, so the trade in hazardous waste for recovery operations can similarly lead to the transfer of environmental costs in an uncontrolled fashion. The Basel Convention was drafted to cover both kinds of processes, that is both final disposal <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and recovery operations, and both kinds of processes are included in the convention definitions under the single term "disposal". The Australian act does not cover a wide range of hazardous wastes from which valuable materials are to be recovered; these hazardous wastes have not been rejected as worthless or do not fall within the ordinary meaning of waste. The major purpose of amending the act is to remedy this discrepancy between our international obligations and our domestic legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Basel Convention is the primary international instrument under which trade in hazardous waste is controlled. It is the set of rules for this trade on which Australia and the many other countries which are parties to the convention have agreed. As virtually all of Australia's trading partners are either parties to the convention or parties to similar sets of rules established by the OECD, it is in Australia's trade interests, as well as within our international obligations, to abide by these rules. The interpretation of the convention as expressed in the principal act and with the amendments now put forward is in line with the views of other parties to the convention. In the absence of these amendments, Australia will continue to be out of step with other Parties in its capacity to give domestic effect to the convention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In accordance with the primary intention of the bill, the object of the act is to be amended to make it clear that one of its major aims is to give domestic effect to the Basel Convention and other international instruments relating to trade in hazardous wastes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The definition of hazardous waste now to be adopted is aligned with that in the convention. This will ensure that in future Australia does not find itself in breach of the convention by virtue of having adopted a definition which is at odds with the interpretation of the convention followed by others. Nevertheless, the question of definition remains central to the operation of the act, and indeed definitional questions remain the subject of very active debate in Basel Convention meetings. In Australia, a high degree of concern has been expressed because of the uncertainty of the definitions in the convention. The bill addresses these concerns through the establishment of a process to provide greater practical certainty regarding what is and is not a hazardous waste. The bill provides for the establishment of a Technical Group of scientific and technical experts who will advise the Minister on definitional questions. The advice of this group will be of great benefit in enabling the Minister to decide whether he or she believes that a material falls within the definition of hazardous waste and so is regulated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister will have the power to issue Evidentiary Certificates which will be prima facie evidence that a given material is or is not a hazardous <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="162"> waste; and by compiling a list of materials for which Evidentiary Certificates have been issued, the Minister will be able to provide greater certainty to those subject to regulation on what materials will be controlled and what will not. This means for example, that it will be possible to issue an Evidentiary Certificate stating that a material such as clean ferrous scrap is not a hazardous waste subject to the act and can be traded without any controls. At the same time, flexibility will be retained to respond to incremental progress in international discussions on what materials should and should not be controlled. As an example, recent international discussions suggest that the existence of internationally recognised product specifications will be influential in deciding what are and are not hazardous wastes. The Evidentiary Certificates will not be conclusive, but will be prima facie evidence; and the definitions in the act would remain as the final means of determining the definitional question. In practice, however, the advice of the Technical Group will provide the government with the capability of issuing clear guidance on definitional issues, and should satisfy the needs of those who are subject to regulation for a clear understanding of their obligations under the act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are many who would prefer to replace the uncertain Basel definitions with Australia's own list or set of criteria. To follow that course, however, would inevitably lead to Australia once again being at odds with the convention and the views of trading partners on what constitutes hazardous waste under the convention. This would risk not only breach of our international obligations but could well lead to shipments acceptable under our definitions being rejected at foreign ports, to the embarrassment, cost and inconvenience of all.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The convention itself recognises that the hazard criteria it establishes are in need of further development. There is provision for the development of national tests which would provide greater precision in determining whether a waste is hazardous. That provision is included in the relevant Annex to the convention, by reference to which the bill defines hazardous waste. Over time the Technical Group will advise on national tests to establish hazard on a more certain basis, taking account of international developments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another key concept in the convention now adopted into the act is the definition of "environmentally sound management". The convention requires not only that an exporting country obtain prior consent from the country of import before allowing the transboundary movement to proceed, but also that the country of export require that the waste to be shipped is managed in an environmentally sound way in the country of import. The concept of environmentally sound management of hazardous waste is defined in the convention as "taking all practicable steps" to ensure that the hazardous <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> waste is managed to protect human health and the environment. The Technical Group will advise the Minister to assist in determination of what constitutes environmentally sound management and whether particular facilities or processes meet the definition. For that reason, it will include people with expertise in scientific and technical, social and economic, environmental and public health fields.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The concept of environmentally sound management as set out in the convention replaces the phrase in the principal act "dispose of safely". In the principal act "dispose of safely" is defined in terms of an outcome, that is hazardous waste is disposed of safely provided there is no damage to human health or environment. By contrast, "environmentally sound management" is defined by reference to a process, that is, "taking all practicable steps" to prevent damage to human health or the environment. On the other hand, he definition of "dispose of safely" appears to exclude any assessment of effluents and emissions from the disposal process. In practice, pragmatic considerations are likely to prevail. Within the Basel Convention process detailed guidelines on what constitutes environmentally sound management have already been drafted, and these will provide the context for the Technical Group's advice to the Minister. Australia will put its efforts into ensuring that those guidelines are sound. Once again, the need to ensure that our legislation is fully in line with our international obligations is the overriding consideration in the changes set out in the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the convention the general rule is that Parties must not trade in hazardous waste with non-Parties. An exception to this is provided for in Article 11, whereby Parties may enter into agreements or arrangements either with other Parties or with non-Parties. These agreements or arrangements can set out controls which are different from those prescribed by the convention itself, provided those controls do not reduce the level of environment protection intended by the convention. The main such agreement to which Australia is a party is the OECD Decision on Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Waste Destined for Recovery Operations (the OECD Decision), which regulates transboundary movement of hazardous wastes among OECD countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides explicitly for regulations giving effect to such agreements and arrangements, and for those regulations to give domestic effect to rules different from those in the convention. The materials covered by the agreements or arrangements may also differ to some extent from those covered by the convention. Thus the OECD Decision covers some wastes which are not hazardous wastes under the convention and trade in these must comply with the controls set out by the Decision; conversely, the Decision classifies some materials as non-hazardous waste (the OECD Green <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="163"> List) and these materials may be traded without a permit provided countries outside the OECD are not involved. The provisions are general and can be applied to any further Article 11 agreements or arrangements which Australia enters into.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The procedures by which the Minister reaches a decision on whether or not a permit should be issued for a transboundary movement have been amended, once again to bring the act more closely into line with the convention. Among the changes are those ensuring that the notification and consent procedures established by the convention are followed. Another amends the existing provision that the Minister have regard to the prospect of processing hazardous waste within Australia rather than allowing export to take place. This is in accordance with Article 4(2)(d) of the convention which requires parties to "minimise the transboundary movement of hazardous waste</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">consistent with the environmentally sound and efficient management of hazardous waste". The intent of this Article is met by requirements that disposal in Australia must be both efficient and environmentally sound. The intent is that a local disposal facility must be more than merely an experimental or test facility, and must operate on a commercial basis. There must be some cost effectiveness factor which is brought to bear when the Minister weighs up the pros and cons of local versus overseas disposal in deciding whether or not a permit should be issued.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principal act already provides that there must be appropriate insurance for shipments of hazardous waste before a permit is issued. A new provision in the bill allows the Minister to require bonds or guarantees in addition to, or instead of, insurance. This recognises that where there is contravention of a permit, for one reason or other an insurance policy may not be paid out, and in an appropriate case a bond would allow the Commonwealth to ensure that there was some coverage. In other cases insurance may not be available, and a guarantee would provide the opportunity for a permit to be issued in such cases. The principal act allows the sum total of such arrangements (insurance, bonds, and guarantees) to be assessed when the Minister comes to a decision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other procedural amendments are aimed at ensuring that the administration of the act proceeds smoothly and efficiently, and that all convention requirements are met. Because the convention itself contains detailed rules, it has not been possible to simplify the administrative system beyond a certain point. That is why both the principal act and the amending bill are complex. Where possible and appropriate, provision is made for the making of regulations to set out requirements under the act, in order to ensure that its administration will be flexible and responsive to the needs of industry. A detailed set <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of administrative procedures is being developed in consultation with interested parties, including industry, and will be complete by the time the amendments are ready to come into force.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The act also addresses a number of aspects of the convention which were not picked up in the original drafting process. One of the most important of these is the issue of transit permits, that is for Australian consent (or its denial) to the transiting of waste from another country on its way to a third country for disposal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is also explicit provision for more than one shipment of the same hazardous waste to be covered by a single permit. The convention allows such a procedure up to a maximum of 12 months, provided that certain conditions are met and that is now reflected in the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current system for recovery of the government's administrative costs in respect of issuing permits is unnecessarily inflexible. The bill provides for fees to be set in regulations on the basis of administrative costs of each type of permit. The Minister has discretion to reduce fees where appropriate. The fee level may not be above the fee currently prescribed in the principal act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Penalties under the act have been increased in order to provide a deterrent to illegal traffic. Prevention of illegal traffic is specifically required by the convention, and the value of some of the transactions involved requires that penalties be raised to ensure that companies are deterred from failing to comply with the act's requirements. A new provision is that executive officers of companies will be personally liable for contraventions by companies, with the onus of proof resting with the Commonwealth&mdash;that is, liability will not be automatic. Liability for executive officers of companies is an important step in ensuring compliance with the act, as it would be difficult for other compliance measures to be effective&mdash;for example, identification of hazardous wastes at the Customs barrier when materials leave the country would often be difficult given that hazardous waste cannot readily be distinguished from a variety of other materials.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Third party standing under the principal act is already very broad with respect to appeals to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Standing under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 has been extended by providing standing for Australian organisations and associations which have matters which relate to the act as part of their object or purpose. This will provide further legislative clarity to the standing rules for the purposes of the ADJR Act and is an extension of the standing rules already recognised in recent cases under other similar legislation. The standing provisions in the bill relate only to persons or organisations living or incorporated in Australia. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="164"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill has been the subject of extensive consultations with a variety of groups both inside and outside government. In particular, detailed consultations have been held with a Policy Reference Group made up of representatives of industry, environment groups, development and co-operation groups, and unions. State and territory governments have also been consulted. An exposure draft of the bill was provided to members of the Reference Group and to states and territories, and comments have been taken into account in finalising the bill. In the course of the consultations, an issue which has stimulated more discussion than any other is the prospect of bans of transboundary movement of hazardous wastes from developed to developing countries. This issue has been the subject of a decision at the Second Meeting of the Conference of Parties to the Basel Convention in March 1994 (Decision II/12) and an amendment decision at the Third Conference of Parties to the convention in September 1995 (Decision III/1). This latter decision, known as the Ban Amendment, implements an immediate ban on the export of hazardous waste for final disposal from countries listed in Annex VII of the convention (parties and other states which are members of the OECD and the EC, and Liechtenstein) to non-Annex VII countries; and phases out by the end of 1997 and bans from that date the export of hazardous waste for recovery operations from Annex VII countries to non-Annex VII countries. In it Explanation of Vote at that meeting, Australia said that ". . . it is essential Parties have a common understanding of what is prohibited", and indicated that it would "only consider ratifying the [ban] amendment when the work on hazardous characteristics is completed to (Australia's) satisfaction". (The work referred to is being carried out by the Basel Convention's Technical Working Group, and is aimed at clarifying the wastes covered by the convention.)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important to note that the bill does not implement the Ban Amendment. This government is yet to consider its position on ratification of the amendment, and before any decision is made on ratification, the government's new process for treaty-making must be observed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The export of wastes for final disposal to developing countries, however, is not generally regarded as acceptable practice. That is now reflected in the bill. Indeed the bill extends that policy by limiting exports for final disposal to any country to exceptional circumstances, such as where there is a direct risk to human health or environment if the waste remains in Australia, or if the wastes are being exported for research or testing. Each permit issued under this provision of the amended act will be specified in the regulations to ensure that the application of the concept of "exceptional circumstances" is transparent and subject to scrutiny by the community. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The extension of the definition of hazardous waste from that in the principal act to that in the convention will inevitably result in regulation of a far wider range of hazardous wastes than at present. Studies which have been carried out recently into the range of wastes that may be covered by the Basel Convention and Australia's trade in them suggests that total trade may be somewhere between $100 million and $200 million each year. The vast majority of this takes place with OECD countries, and is therefore subject to the less rigid controls set out by the OECD Decision. The kinds of materials in which we trade with developing countries of our region include spent lead acid batteries, metal-bearing wastes such as sludges, slags and drosses and a miscellaneous range of wastes variously containing metals such as lead or arsenic. These are the kinds of materials which will be regulated under the amended act. Suggestions that ferrous and most non-ferrous scrap metal will be caught up under the convention are mistaken.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In general, the amended act will not cover trade in products, mineral ores and concentrates, processed minerals and metals, petroleum products, forest products including uncontaminated waste paper, textiles, or materials produced to meet commercial specifications intended for recycling. The distinction between wastes on the one hand, and non-wastes on the other, will be subject to consideration and advice by the Technical Group, and will exclude co-products, intermediates and by-products from the definition of hazardous wastes. The Technical Group will also be giving priority to assisting the Minister in determining which of the OECD green listed materials are clearly inside the scope of the act and which are clearly outside it, with a view to the Minister's reflecting this in Evidentiary Certificates. Consultations with all interested parties will continue as regulations and supporting administrative arrangements are developed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Bilateral discussions between Australia and our developing-country trading partners make it clear that they wish and expect Australia to abide by the rules to which so many of the countries of the world have agreed. A continued failure to do so may lead to retaliatory reaction by these countries, which could threaten trade far more seriously than the controls required by the convention and now established by this bill. It is time for Australia to give effect to the obligations it has taken upon itself, just as the vast majority of its trading partners have done.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this chamber today as the youngest woman ever elected to a federal parliament. It is an honour that I cherish but for no longer than it takes other young women to be chosen by an electorate that has shown it wants true representation of all sectors of our population. I look forward to the day when I look across this chamber from my seat and see such a diversity of faces&mdash;young people, old people, different ages, men and women, and the many cultures that make up our nation, including indigenous cultures&mdash;that we no longer have to strive for it. When that time comes I think we will accept that neither youth nor age, any more than being male or female, black or white, is a virtue in itself, except that it deserves to be represented in a system that claims to be representative.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Accepting and including difference with tolerance and respect is what Australia has shown herself to be all about, and I think we are all proud of that. I hope you will consider that what I have to offer is worthy of this great chamber and that what I have to say is of more interest than my footwear, which the media seems to notice so frequently. The truth is that last year I was given very big shoes to fill when I replaced former Senator John Coulter after he retired due to ill-health. I am pleased to say that Dr Coulter is in the gallery today, looking much more robust after surgery. In fact, I served only two days in this place before the federal election when the electors of South Australia showed great confidence in my party, giving me a quota in my own right and saving me from the fate of being the shortest serving senator.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John Coulter's eight years in this parliament will be remembered for many things: his negotiation of the ethanol package, his time as leader during a period of consolidation for the Australian Democrats, his staunch defence <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of public funding for the CSIRO and his commitment to research and development. He remains one of Australia's most committed environmentalists and I look forward to continuing his work, be it fighting for an end to uranium mining and its export, reforming our constitution to include an environmental power, or highlighting our threatened species, a cause many of you will have become more familiar with over the Easter break&mdash;that is, assuming your chocolate bilby made it through staff security checks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank John for his wisdom and his support. It was during his time as leader that he took a chance by employing me as a researcher. I was very young, but fresh from campus and fuelled by a desire for social reform. I was given responsibility for the education, training and youth portfolios, areas dear to my heart and ones I also gladly act as the spokesperson for today. It was through this work that I discovered not only the wonders of this chamber but the many opportunities there are to effect change through the parliament and law making.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We live in a time where legislation is greatly affecting destinies. Equal opportunity legislation and sex discrimination laws have changed lives for the better without dampening the fierce individualism that Australians wish to maintain. I think the native title package has the potential to go the same way towards righting institutionalised and ancient wrongs in the relations between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians. It seems natural to me to want to be a part of this process&mdash;one that puts into laws the nation's best aspirations of fairness and decency and also fosters decent dealings between people. Some of the best, if not all, changes for the better in Australian society have been initiated or supported by laws of this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should say that at this time of national grief and overwhelming loss of life in Tasmania, Australians need no reminding that the first duty of government is to maintain and secure public safety. Whatever we considered the major issues to be in advance of this session, I think what happened on Sunday afternoon in Port Arthur must change our priorities. We must ensure that any legislative powers we have and all our wisdom and will <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="166"> are used to prevent another such massacre. I express my deepest sympathies for all those suffering personal loss as a result of that dreadful event.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I can speak at all for the youth of this country it is to say that we want to respect our institutions and our leaders and we want to pursue change that makes individuals free and able to pursue their hopes and dreams whatever their circumstances. We want respect for our land and sea, the rivers and sky of this great country. We want our environment cared for and protected. For this, too, we look towards legislation to draw all Australians into a shared determination that Australia shall be a healthy continent, its beauty and its life&hyphen;giving forces sustained forever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This philosophy underpins the Australian Democrats. We are committed to the notion of intergenerational equity&mdash;the notion that we have a responsibility to promote fairness not only within current generations but between one generation and the next. It is this concept of ecological sustainability, combined with the Democrats' commitment to social justice and democracy, that made me join a political party. I bring to the parliament the values of that party and values that have been formed in the late 20th century, an education enhanced or limited by decisions made in this parliament and the experiences of a peer group and my parents, which reflect contemporary challenges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am part of a multicultural generation, born in Adelaide to Shirley Stott and Mario Despoja, hence my name. I have spent nearly all my life in the state that I represent, apart from a brief period in Canberra when I attended Canberra Boys Grammar as part of a co-educational experiment. That the school is boys only today suggests that the experiment failed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has not dampened my enthusiasm for taking on male&hyphen;dominated institutions based in Canberra. My mother is my enduring role model. She took on the male&hyphen;dominated institution of journalism while raising two children. It is her <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> experiences that have given me insight to the many problems that face single mothers in our community, just as her severe deafness has taught me literally to speak up. On that note, I would like to acknowledge that we have a hearing loop system here for people who are hearing impaired. I hope we do not have to wait too long before our parliamentary broadcasts of question time are subtitled so that we can actually make the workings of parliament more accessible to the 11 per cent of the population who are hearing impaired.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently I addressed a women's group that my mother had spoken to the year I was born, except in 1969 so appalled were some women at my mother's intention of being a working mother that they walked out in disgust, but not before predicting that her child would be a delinquent. I am not sure whether politics qualifies as delinquency, but it is a sign of progress that 26 years later her daughter can address that same women's group, as a member of the federal parliament, without too many forecasts of doom and gloom.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we still have a long way to go in our society before women have equality with men. I am glad to say that South Australia has led the way in legislative reform for women. And, of course, I belong to a political party that has the best record when it comes to women's representation. Not only that, we have achieved what no&hyphen;one else has done, and that is elected a female leader, a tradition we have continued with the fine leadership of Senator Cheryl Kernot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even though my state may have been the first place in the entire world to grant women the right to vote and the right to stand for parliament in 1894, today only 20 per cent of our elected representatives to the federal parliament are women. In fact, Parliament House, as you all know, has a glass ceiling&mdash;literally, as if to emphasise this political difficulty for women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to pay tribute to my colleagues and acknowledge the presence in the gallery of my mother, my friends, family, party members, and staff members and also acknowledge the life&hyphen;long support of my brother Luke and my godmother Heather Duncan. A lot of people have supported and fostered my <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="167"> political involvement, beginning as it did in secondary school with involvement in the State Council of Students and International Youth Year activities. To paraphrase Sir Winston Churchill's advice to his son: politics is like piano playing; the earlier you start, the better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My political awakening came as a student at the University of Adelaide. I am part of `Generation HECS', that group of graduates who have accumulated debt for no other reason that their decision to broaden their knowledge. One former minister, when he heard that I was the Australian Democrats' higher education spokesperson, and shadowing his portfolio area, said, `Trust me to get the former student activist.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I covet this portfolio, not simply as a former campus president, but as someone who is unshakeably committed to the belief that education is a right and that education, be it primary, secondary or tertiary, is a community resource.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1974 tertiary fees were abolished and that opened up our tertiary institutions, challenging their unspoken privilege and increasing access for traditionally under&hyphen;represented groups, such as women, disabled people, people from differed socio&hyphen;economic backgrounds, as well as Aboriginal and Islander people. But that legacy of the Whitlam era was under threat when I arrived on campus in the late 1980s. Policy changes by the federal government aligned education with economic objectives and students were designated consumers to justify the re&hyphen;imposition of fees in a new form&mdash;the higher education contribution scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats were, and remain, the only party to recognise that the concept of students as consumers is a distortion. In undertaking their studies, students not only seek qualifications to assist with employment, but are also broadening their political, cultural and social horizons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Education offers empowerment. It is one way that individuals can affect their own destinies. And those people who protest against disincentives to education, such as fees and loans, should not be told simply to `get a job'. Nor should young people strug gling to find work in today's workforce be told by the media, or anyone else, to `get a haircut'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr President, it is often said that some cultures have a special respect for the aged. I think our society has a special fear of the young. They are so often stigmatised as lazy, unappreciative of parents, easily lured to drugs, and uncaring about their country, their history and their language. I think we need to ask whether some people, perhaps no longer categorised as young, are allowing themselves to repeat atavistic fears that have no foundation in reality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No group in society has been more consistently subject to structural change and its cruel and cutting edge, and for a longer period, than the young. I do not underestimate the pain of older workers whose jobs have disappeared nor devalue the struggle of women to find their role in the work force, but often young people feel defeated before they even start out and, as they experience the hardship of disappearing jobs, they are derided as dole bludgers and layabouts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For four years I have conducted the Democrats' Youth Poll, the only survey by a political party that gives young people a chance to express their views on a range of topics&mdash;employment, education, sex, drugs and rock `n roll. The Youth Poll paints a very different picture of young Australians. It shows a very caring generation&mdash;caring about employment prospects and concerned about their families and teenage suicide levels. They are anxious to be a part of decision making processes and determined&mdash;absolutely determined&mdash;to ensure that the environment is not further degraded. Perhaps even the vilified Paxton young people care more about the big picture&mdash;the nation, their future&mdash;than some media will ever allow us to know.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, it is true that young people show disdain for politicians and are cynical about the political process. The Youth Poll shows that only 1.5 per cent of young people trust us. Research may show that a majority of young people do not know that we have a constitution or believe that Jim Bolger is a professional surfer, but our own Senate standing committee reports into active citizenship <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="168"> reveal that over 80 per cent of secondary school students want to know more about the electoral and political processes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Civics education will go some way towards addressing this but we have a responsibility. We have to ensure that young people's issues are addressed and that they are drawn into this process, the process that so affects their destinies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The priority for any government must be the creation of jobs for young Australians&mdash; long&hyphen;term, sustainable jobs&mdash;not the `McJobs' that Douglas Coupland talks about in <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Generation X</EMPHASIS>, which he defines as `low&hyphen;skilled, low&hyphen;valued and low&hyphen;paid jobs'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Employment growth needs a healthy economy, but an economy cannot stay healthy in the long term without us making sure that we use our national assets&mdash;our environment, our savings&mdash;in a sustainable way. We must link employment creation with environmental protection, something the Democrats have long recognised. We have pushed for a long time for jobs in sustainable and future industries, such as high technology fields, value&hyphen;added manufacturing, and the fast&hyphen;growing environmental industries. This will ensure continuing quality of life, both now and extending to all future generations of Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an exciting time to be a member of the federal parliament as we debate questions central to our nation's future and to how we will be seen in the next millennium. As co-chair of the South Australian Republican Movement, I look forward to being part of a movement that involves all Australians in its discourse, especially those who are among the strongest supporters of the move to a republic&mdash;young people. The republican debate also offers us the opportunity to assess our democratic institutions and their fitness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can afford to feel proud of the fact that we live in one of the longest continuous democracies in the western world. But this does not mean we should not seek to update or review our democratic systems. We should reform our constitution to reflect contemporary challenges, to recognise prior ownership, to refer to Australia's natural and geographic heritage and to enshrine in all states the bicameral system of parliament.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Increasingly, Australians look to the upper house as a check on executive power, just as they rely on the Democrats as their parliamentary watchdog. Our role is about much more than ensuring accountability. The role of the Senate is not only to keep the government honest but also to give the government a few ideas as well. The role of this chamber has changed over time. We no longer operate as a states house but have refined our responsibility as a genuine and deliberate house of review, a house in which I think the views of the populace are more fairly reflected and represented. This role will no doubt come under the spotlight in the coming long months and will confirm what many of us here already believe&mdash;especially Democrats: that the real action takes place on the red leather benches. I am honoured to take my place on these benches today and I thank honourable senators for their indulgence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that before I leave this place young people will no longer be unrepresented in this chamber or in the other place. I hope that I can make a contribution to help bring that about. I am aware of how big an aim this is and how modest the talents I bring, but if hard work can do it then I shall make that contribution. Thank you.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I start by congratulating Senator Stott Despoja on a most interesting and obviously well researched first speech. I say in passing that some of the despair she exudes for young people is really a result of the last decade or so of Labor rule. A lot of that despair arises from the inability of young people to obtain employment. Under a new government I look forward to a situation where young people are able to get employment in much the same way as I was able to when I left school. When I left school&mdash;I was young once&mdash;I was able to choose between four jobs that were offered to me. That is the sort of thing that has been unheard of for 11 or so years of Labor mismanagement.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I am sure that under the new government young people will again have a hope for the future and will be able to obtain meaningful and rewarding employment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="169">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The address by His Excellency the Governor&hyphen;General yesterday sets out a blueprint for Australia's advancement, a direction that the Liberal Party has been working towards in the past decade and one which quite obviously the majority of Australians enthusiastically share. The mandate given to the Liberal Party and the coalition generally indicates that Australians want a change&mdash;a change for the better. The Governor-General's speech set out the change that the new government will be bringing to Australia's direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Various minor politicians and so-called political experts and commentators have been arguing about mandates. But the facts are quite clear. At the most recent opportunity that the people had to express their choice of parliamentarians and policies, they elected the coalition with an absolute majority of 45 seats in the lower house, the House of Representatives, and, significantly, with 50 per cent of senators. I emphasise that when people talk about the role of the Senate and whether mandates have or have not been given. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the last election, 50 per cent of elected senators were from the Liberal and National parties. In each state, the Liberal Party achieved three senators, except in New South Wales and Queensland where the National Party achieved one each to join two Liberals. The Senate result in Queensland was the best ever result for the Liberal Party with, for the very first time in a genuine three&hyphen;party state, the Liberal Senate team achieving more votes than any other party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a passing reference, I want to dispel some of the inaccurate statements made by the Democrats and, curiously, most of the media. The Democrats did not achieve in Queensland a quota in their own right and had to again rely on&mdash;surprise of all surprises&mdash;the preferences of the Labor Party to get their candidate elected. So there we go again. The Labor Party were supporting their mates. At least they are all sitting together on the other side now. The Labor Party ensured the election of a Democrat candidate who could not get a quota in her own right. I am happy to say that the Democrat candidate just pipped the third Liberal candidate, Ms Debbie <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Kember, who would have been and who will be at some time in the future an excellent representative in this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it should also be pointed out that, in spite of comments about the huge increases and gains made by the Democrats, the Democrat candidate this time received much the same sort of vote as she received six years ago, so there has been no increase in Democrat support in Queensland. The Democrat candidate again had to rely on Labor Party support to get herself elected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Liberal Party and the coalition were given an overwhelming mandate and support quite unprecedented in Australia's political history. In Queensland we have a situation where only two of 26 seats are now held by the Labor Party. Two out of 26&mdash;they still do hold two&mdash;are held by the Labor Party. I want to welcome to parliament for their contribution to Australia's direction the 10 new Liberal members from Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am particularly pleased to record that Australia's northernmost electorate and the electorate perhaps furthermost from Canberra&mdash;one which borders our closest neighbouring nation&mdash;is now for the very first time firmly in the hands of the Liberal Party with the election of Mr Warren Entsch to the electorate of Leichhardt. Following the magnificent win in the state election by Lyn Warwick in Barron River, the Liberal Party has really consolidated its position in northern and regional Australia. In the electorate of Herbert my good friend and now colleague, former Townsville city councillor Peter Lindsay, swept the floor in what was previously a traditional Labor seat, particularly since the boundaries have now contracted to encompass basically just the cities of Townsville and Thuringowa.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On election night it was not even exciting in Townsville. From the very first booth that came in it was quite clear that Peter Lindsay had won a remarkable victory. This follows the stunning win by the Liberal Party in the Mundingburra by&hyphen;election that is now part of Australia's political history and which has elevated my friend and colleague, Frank Tanti, to being one of the most recognised politicians in Australia. I am pleased that my <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="170"> faith in Frank Tanti, starting in the days when he ran in an unwinnable Labor ward in the city council election&mdash;and lost it by only 89 votes, I might add&mdash;has been justified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My 10 year goal to turn the north of Australia into a Liberal bastion has at last started to show dividends. When I first entered parliament six years ago I was the only Liberal north of the Brisbane suburb of Aspley in either the state or federal parliament. Queensland, unlike most other states, is a very decentralised state with a great number of federal and state electorates north of the capital city. It is a matter of some pride to me&mdash;and, I must say, relief as I now have four colleagues to do the state and federal work which previously fell to my office&mdash;that there are now four other Liberal parliamentarians in the north. This is not said just because of pride in the political party to which I belong; it is said more in the knowledge that these members are members of a party that supports initiative and enterprise, that believes in freedom and choice; a party in which they will give representation both as part of a Liberal government and as individuals, to the constituents it serves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is impossible for me in the short time available to mention my regard for my new colleagues who have joined us in this place representing my state. I should, however, mention that Peter Slipper's win was quite remarkable and well justified. The wins by Andrea West, Teresa Gambaro, Elizabeth Grace&mdash;all in difficult seats&mdash;Kay Elson and the return of Kathy Sullivan&mdash;the latter two in the Gold Coast region&mdash;show that the Liberal Party is a party of equality where people advance and achieve success because of their abilities, not because of their gender. In fact, all four new Liberal female members defeated very high profile ministers and office holders in the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also more than delighted to see joining us in parliament as well my good friends Graeme McDougall, previously with a magnificent track record as a councillor in the Brisbane City Council; Gary Hardgrave, a very capable young person with a great command of politics and government; and Tony Smith and Mal Brough, both young men <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of great enthusiasm and with real skills and experience that they will bring to this parliament. I am pleased to see them all joining us. To all my other colleagues who were re&hyphen;elected&mdash;Bill Taylor, Alex Somlyay, John Bradford and David Jull&mdash;my congratulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should also congratulate those of my Queensland colleagues elevated to the ministry in the new government. I am particularly delighted to see John Moore in a senior position where he deserves to be. He is a man with so much talent who will make an enormous contribution to Australia's wellbeing, particularly in the business area. To me, John is the pathfinder for the Liberal Party in Queensland in recent times and the one who has brought the party from practical oblivion through to the success it now enjoys. His guidance, influence, encouragement and support has been quite magnificent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also very pleased to see my Senate colleague and friend John Herron achieving portfolio ranking, taking on the difficult and at times contentious role that he has been allocated in the ministry. It is good to see Warwick Parer there in the ministry attending to things that he is very familiar with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should also at this time make reference to the very significant and little known contribution that the Queensland President of the Liberal Party, Bob Tucker, has made to the success of the party in the last couple of years. He, Jim Barron and his team at headquarters should be justifiably proud of the results they have achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new government has a huge task before it. For my area in the north of Australia those challenges are enormous and will require a great deal of consideration and understanding. The Liberal Party now holds more seats in rural and regional Australia than any other political party, holding 31 rural and regional seats to the National Party's 18, Labor's five and the Independents' two. I will ask leave later to incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> a statement regarding regional and rural representation in the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is significant that, except in New South Wales, the Liberal Party now holds in every state the most rural and regional seats. It is essential that the support given to the Liberal <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="171"> Party in the election is reflected in government. I think that it is time to revisit a consumption tax similar to the goods and services tax proposed three years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I acknowledge the honesty, courage and great contribution that John Hewson made to the debate. I only regret that John is not with us at the moment to be part of the new government of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the north, which has a significant export focus, the introduction of a goods and services tax with its attendant exemption from tax on all imports into exports and business would be of real value.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps the one thing that makes me such a strong supporter of the GST is the impact that such a tax would have on petrol prices, which would benefit regional Australia tremendously. The reduction of excise from around 35c per litre to a GST of about 7c or 8c per litre, which would follow on from the introduction of a GST, would have an incalculably beneficial impact on rural and regional Australia, particularly in North Queensland, and would at last give regional Australia a chance to compete equally with those cousins of ours living in the most comfortable confines of the capital cities and in the golden triangle of Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The implementation of a form of GST would have a very beneficial effect on the cost of business inputs, would increase Australia's competitiveness overseas and would lead to greater production and, therefore, greater employment. For a dynamic region like North Queensland all of these outcomes would be of significant benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to see that the government is, in accordance with its election promises, intending to introduce reform of the labour market, which will give Australian employees higher wages based on higher productivity within a framework of guaranteed minimum standards. I am also pleased to note that compulsory unionism will be abolished and effective sanctions against secondary boycotts will be restored.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In light of this move, I would like to think it is incumbent upon the sugar industry in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australia to revisit the closed shop deal between the AWU and the Queensland sugar industry which is in effect compulsory unionism within the sugar industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our proposals to reduce the complexity and compliance costs of the taxation system, particularly in the capital gains tax and fringe benefits tax areas, will be welcomed particularly by small business on whom those taxes have a disproportionate impact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The strengthening of work&hyphen;based training opportunities for young people through a modern apprenticeship and traineeship system will help provide real and meaningful jobs for young people and at the same time will ensure that Australia has a qualified and trained pool of workers in areas where there is a particular need. Older employed Australians will continue to have access to labour market programs, assistance and support services. I am pleased to see that regional and community employment councils will be formed bringing together business leaders, education and training providers and representatives of the wider community to more effectively link the training of unemployed people with real jobs and with a regional development focus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also pleased to see that regional development will figure in projects designed to enhance employment opportunities in the regions of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There needs to be a real attack on youth unemployment, on the alienation of youth and particularly on youth suicide, which is tragically prevalent in rural areas. I am pleased to see the government's emphasis in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="172"> I specifically note the government has made a strong commitment to equality of opportunity for all students in education. It is timely at this stage to reiterate the case accepted by the previous government after pressure from the then opposition that Queensland should receive a quantum of university places which would see my state reach the national average by 1998. I know there is opposition from southern states but Queensland is the only state to record an increase in the applications for higher education while in New South Wales and South Australia particularly con cern is expressed about the capacity of their institutions to meet Commonwealth targets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In attempting to bring Queensland up to parity with the national average, the Commonwealth target for 1998 was based on 88 places per 1,000 head of 17&hyphen; to 34&hyphen;year&hyphen;old population. This target was based on population estimates for 1993 but the 1995 figure shows that the original estimates have been exceeded by about 29,000, of which Queensland accounts for more than half. If this trend continues, Queensland will still not catch up with the national average even with the additional places already promised. All additional places have been allocated in Queensland to regional areas, particularly the new campuses at Cairns and the Sunshine Coast and in others planned in Logan City, Ipswich and Hervey Bay. If, therefore, the Commonwealth government is obliged to cut higher education funding to meet Labor's black hole of $8 billion in the budget, that reduction should be achieved by an equal percentage reduction across all states, not by an arbitrary removal of the growth funding for Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Governor-General's speech, the government gave prominence to a factor that in the past has been conveniently overlooked by bureaucrats and legislators whose horizons never seem to extend beyond the leafy suburbs of Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra. The government very clearly recognises that the nation continues to depend on the natural human resources of rural and regional Australia for a major proportion of its wealth. It is therefore essential that government services continue to apply in these areas and that regional Australians are not, as they were under Labor, treated as second class citizens compared with those living in the capital cities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's commitments to restore the nation's land and water resources infrastructure and enhanced primary industries by removing impediments to international competitiveness are welcomed and must be pursued vigorously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to see that Labor's ridiculous, illogical and insupportable three mines policy will be removed and that new mines will be <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> approved subject to strict environmental, heritage and nuclear safeguards. I do not want to sound like having a bad case of `NIMBY' but at this stage I do want to flag my opposition to any uranium mining in the headwaters of the Burdekin River unless all of us who depend on its water are shown that there is no possibility of any impact on the quality of our water.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our historic and comprehensive environment and sustainable agriculture programs will be of great significance to Australia. I have every confidence in the new Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill), who has already shown a refreshing change to the way environment matters will be handled. Senator Hill is prepared to consult and listen to the sensible arguments of all Australians and not be captive of any particular group. I congratulate Senator Hill on the work he is already doing in that regard and also on both his election and his appointment as Leader of the Government in the Senate. We are indeed fortunate in the Senate that that type of leadership is available, leadership that will ensure the proper and decorous workings of this chamber and the speedy progress of government business through the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should also, in passing, pay tribute to the great work of my friend and colleague, Senator Rod Kemp, in guiding our environment policy through the election. I look forward to the resolution of the Labor government's politically motivated interference in the Queensland government's approval of a tourist facility at Cardwell. It is essential that our unique natural environment is available to all to experience and enjoy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tourism is Australia's fastest growing export industry. It attracted $10.6 billion in expenditure from foreign visitors in the 1993&hyphen;94 year, according to BTR, and another $36.3 billion from Australian residents. Tourism's share of domestic output is estimated at about 5.5 per cent. It employs directly 535,600 people, or about 6.9 per cent of the work force. Every effort must be made by the government to support this industry and to reverse current impediments on the industry's growth. Coming from North Queensland, which is the leading area as far as Australia's <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="173"> tourism is concerned, I know that the government's policies will enhance tourism and our export capacity in that regard in the years ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">North Queensland and generally northern Australia have a significant and special interest in both defence and trade. I urge the government to concentrate its defence preparedness in northern Australia. The defence forces situated in Townsville, Cairns and Darwin in particular are a great example of the professionalism of our armed forces and also bring a great sense of community and economic benefit to the areas in which they are located.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am always conscious that those of us in the north live closer to the almost 200 million people in Indonesia than we do to the majority of Australians resident in the southern capitals. It is well recognised that Australia's future is in the north. Its proximity to the burgeoning markets of South-East Asia, particularly to Indonesia and Malaysia, means that trade will continue to have an important and ever expanding focus in the north.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Northern industry and exports have achieved great successes without the indirect and subtle assistance given to southern industries and exports. That success will continue. I urge the government not to be overwhelmed by the voices in the south for artificial support mechanisms for exports which naturally emanate from the north of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All Australians should have equality of opportunity. Divisions based on gender, race or colour should become a thing of the past in Australia under the new government. Unfortunately, the Labor government, despite what I will concede may have been its best intentions, has created the opposite impact. I look forward to ensuring that Aboriginal and Islander Australians have the same opportunities in health, education, housing and employment as all other Australians do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As one who lives in a part of Australia where many Aboriginal and Islander people reside, and as one who has during the last six years spent a considerable amount of time in the Aboriginal and Islander communities, I look forward to the time when indigenous people are able to maintain their place and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> traditions in an Australia free from racial or social conflicts. In my days at school, Aboriginal and Islander people were treated as equals. I look forward to the day when  this again occurs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Liberal Party has always maintained a commitment to the High Court's decision on native title. However, it is without question that the native title legislation, bullied through parliament by the Labor Party&mdash;more as a political exercise than for any other purpose&mdash;is quite unworkable. It will be a major achievement of this government when native title legislation is dealt with in a way which makes the High Court's decisions workable and fair to all concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In accordance with its election promises, the Liberal and National parties will be considering constitutional reform through forums, discussions and consultations. I have always had the view that Australia will eventually become a republic but that it will do so under a Liberal government rather than under a Labor government. The Australian public would never trust Labor with any tampering with our current constitution. I believe that, under a more moderate, sensible and consultative government, the majority of Australians will have confidence that our new system of parliament will be one which maintains the best and, I might say, the most of our traditional form of government, but with some change perhaps to the head of state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst I suppose I could be classed as being mildly in the republican camp, I have no such equivocation about our flag. Our nation's flag is our nation's flag and must forever remain that. It must not be changed at the whim of any government to accord with what is trendy in the advertising or marketing arena at any particular era of our history. The government's proposals to ensure that the flag cannot be altered without the people's approval is a significant step. I am sure it will mean that our flag will remain forever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very pleased to support the address&hyphen;in&hyphen;reply motion to the Governor&hyphen;General's speech moved by my colleague Senator Teague. The amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Faulkner) is a churlish one. It really deserves <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="174"> little comment in this debate, apart from saying&mdash;and re-emphasising&mdash;that our proposals in relation to Telstra were very clearly enunciated before the election.</PARA>

Fifty per cent of the senators were elected to the Liberal and National parties.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite clear, as I mentioned and have again emphasised, that the Australian Democrats again are showing their involvement with the Labor Party.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is correct. Have a look through them. I had a look through them before I came in, Senator Kernot. It is a pity that I do not have the results or I would table them. The full results from Queensland showed that Senator Kernot was getting there. She did not get a quota in her own right, but she was getting there&mdash;200 from all the odd groups on the left, 100 here, 100 there. But she was nowhere near the quota. What happened?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you call that a mandate, if you call that anything except being part of the Labor Party group, then you deserve the sort of response that the Democrats received from the Australian public.

Your vote is within 0.3 per cent of what you got six years ago. If you call that a mandate, I do not know where you get your reasoning from.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is significant that in this election not only did we get that huge result in the lower house but in the Senate&mdash;and this has got to be emphasised&mdash;the Liberal and National parties got 50 per cent of the senators on a very clear and explicit policy. That is, I think you will concede, Madam Acting Deputy President, almost unprecedented in Senate elections around Australia. It has been a magnificent result for the Liberal and National parties in the Senate, a chamber where usually the vote goes everywhere. The Democrats, I think, lost one and gained one, but it was all at the expense of the Labor Party. The people of Australia quite clearly understand that it does not matter who you vote for. Whether you vote for the Democrats or Labor, it is all the same, because they have the same policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should indulge myself in the last couple of minutes, if I can, by just pointing out the pettiness of the Democrats. Have a look at the Queensland card that they registered. Their preferences went to everyone except us, I might mention. They started at the top of the thing and went down. They went to 15, 16, 17. They got to the Nationals&mdash;it was Boswell. They got to 28, 29, 30. They got through them all and got to the Liberal Party. Then they counted from the bottom and went upwards. So I got the last vote and I am very proud of that. It is a badge of honour. The pettiness of it is just incredible. I am very pleased to announce that I am going to talk about that as often as I can. I shall wear that as a badge of courage. I thank Senator Kernot for letting me know that I point out the undeniable truth about her relationship with the Labor Party and that is that they are just part of the team.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can I just ascertain that Senator Ian Macdonald has finished all of his interjections for the time being? Before I speak on the address-in-reply, two speeches ago in this chamber we heard the debut speech of Senator Stott Despoja of the Australian Democrats. On behalf of the opposition, as I am the first opposition speaker since that speech, I congratulate her on a very fine debut speech.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We observe the comments made, I thought uncharitably, by Senator Ian Macdonald following upon her address that the dispiriting nature of the youth view of Australia was due to the Australian Labor Party. In fact, I understood the senator to actually say that the young people of Australia had an inspiring view of the prospects of this country and that, in fact, they were pigeonholed into a caricature by the media, which had them as a drug-riddled, disinterested, unemployment prone group. But indeed, their view is much wider in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday the Governor-General, Sir William Deane, opened the 38th parliament of Australia and delivered the opening address. The tradition is, of course, that in that address he presents an outline of the program for the coming three years of the government. I rise to speak in the address following that speech and to support the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition in this chamber, Senator Faulkner, on Telstra. I mean no disrespect to the Governor-General, but I do <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="178"> intend in my remarks this evening to criticise some of the aspects referred to in that speech as the government's program for the next three years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before turning to the speech, I say that it is the first appearance by the Governor-General as the Governor-General in this parliament. He was appointed to the position of Governor-General by the Keating government at the beginning of this year. I congratulate him on his elevation. I think Sir William has proven to be a thoughtful and distinguished member of the High Court and I believe he will fill the office of Governor-General with equal distinction. He is, in the view of all Australians I believe, an excellent choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In the last several months Australia has come through what I believe to be a quite extraordinary time. A government which, I think by fair measure, would be regarded as a successful government has been turned from office at a time when the Australian economy is buoyant and where the prospects, particularly for the latter half of this year, are ones for strong economic growth. It is unusual&mdash;in fact, I think, unprecedented&mdash;that governments are defeated in those circumstances. Let us look at the details of the Australian economy and compare the record of the Labor government with the record of the previous Fraser government, a government in which the now Prime Minister was a Treasurer. On inspection, you can see that the records, on a historic Australian national comparison&mdash;if <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> you like, us, the Labor government of the time, compared to them, the Liberal government of the time&mdash;show that we had much more effective managerial credentials than they did. If you compare us on a geographical or global basis&mdash;that is, to like economies elsewhere in the world&mdash;our economic performance was indeed, by that measure too, outstanding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If one compares the records on economic growth, one sees that the average rate of real economic growth during the Labor period of office was 3.7 per cent. When Mr Howard was Treasurer it was 2.2 per cent. The average rate of inflation during the period in which Mr Howard was Treasurer was 9.8 per cent whereas under the Labor government it was, on average, 5.3 per cent, and since June 1991 it was on average 2.5 per cent. The rate of inflation at the time Mr Howard last left office as Treasurer in Australia was 11.4 per cent, whereas the rate of inflation when we faced the electors early this year was 5.1 per cent. And so the figures go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to another key measure: employment. The average number of jobs created per year during the period of Mr Howard's incumbency as Treasurer was 50,199, whereas during our 13 years of office we averaged on the job creation front 164,514 jobs per annum. The average annual growth in employment during Mr Howard's incumbency as Treasurer was 0.8 per cent, whereas under us it was 2.9 per cent. Unemployment when John Howard left office as Treasurer was 10 per cent, whereas the rate when we faced the electors was about 8.1 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the measure that most home owners in Australia are concerned about&mdash;that is, the measure of home loan interest rates&mdash;the average home loan interest rate today is roughly around 9.7 per cent, whereas when Mr Howard left office in 1983 it was 14 per cent, with a strong argument being that the practical rate, given the cocktail nature of the loans at the time, was about 18.9 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make those comparisons for a number of reasons. I make them because I want to make two observations about this election. The first observation is that I think the modern Australian electorate is certainly more volatile than <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="179"> we have become used to in our previous electoral experience. Indeed, I think that, with strong economic performance, the electorate is more ready to pay attention to issues such as the `it's time' factor. That type of approach does count in their minds more than it would at other times of economic difficulty. So, in part, I think the decision was made easier by the electors facing to a `it's time' type of enticement than it would have been had the economy been in less good shape than it is now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other element of this election that is worthy of noting in this address-in-reply speech is, as well, the policies that the opposition at the time, now the government, ran on in that election were policies that mirrored in many respects the policies of the government of the day; that is, the policies of the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember, graphically and surprisingly, ads being aired in the closing days of the campaign on, for example, Medicare&mdash;an area in which the now government, then opposition, had trenchantly criticised us, the government, during 13 years of Labor government in this country&mdash;indicating that, in fact, they had moved to a position in which Medicare, one of the defining issues of difference between the two major parties in this country, was now an issue of no difference. That obviously means that they a have jumped from their position of the past&mdash;an implicit admission that they were wrong in the past and acceptance that we were right; that we have pioneered and engineered significant change in Australian health care delivery and health care servicing in this country; and that now they would join us and minimise that difference between us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of the other policy formulations that they put were formulations of policy that we had pioneered too. We have as an outcome of this election&mdash;I must say there are a few notable exceptions to those points&mdash;a situation in which the risks of voting conservative were minimised as a deliberate election ploy. Mr Howard was presented to the electors as someone who would not rock the boat, who would not bring in radical change and who would tread softly. It would be pretty much <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> business as usual. I think that, as I have said before, no doubt the Australian people take the view that if the economy is sound they can then risk a change of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well, I think the peculiar outcome of this election is that the Liberal&hyphen;National Party coalition is governing with, essentially, the Labor mandate and that the Australian people have taken the Liberal&hyphen;National Party commitment to that mandate at face value. While recognising that fact as an analytical imperative, nonetheless, unfortunately, there are already signs that that faith is being betrayed. Of course, we in opposition, loyal to our task, will take every opportunity to point out where the mandate has been deviated from.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well as those remarks about the most recent election there are, of course, lessons in the outcome for the Labor Party. We are a party that certainly has retained a vision for the future, a flexibility in the application of the principles for which we stand so that they fit the circumstances of the time and a fundamental commitment to standing up for the ordinary Australian people in this country. But the election lessons are lessons of us in defeat, and we will honestly face what those lessons mean to us. We will forge again a strong bond with the Australian people, and we will rekindle the confidence that they have in us that enabled us to govern in this country for so long and so successfully. We will come back to power as soon as that will and confidence is restored.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What troubles me about the present Australian government is their readiness to manipulate the arguments, to manipulate the economic outcomes and the expectations of the community to suit political ends&mdash;to, in fact, engage in political double speak. For example, in the field of small business, we have had a lot of rhetoric about the importance of small business to the Australian economy. Of course, small business is integral to the success of the Australian economy. This is a country in which small business is the most common form of business found anywhere, and about 80 per cent of business activities conducted in this country are conducted by what you would define as small business. Therefore, it is not to provide a great insight <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="180"> but, nonetheless, to cite a reassuring fact when one says that small business is the rock upon which economic growth will be built. If you can encourage the growth of small business, so too will you encourage the growth of employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is true, but it is also in the field of a motherhood statement and it does not take us any further. The truth of those assertions, the truth of that propaganda position, really is found in the detailed policy prescriptions about how the objectives enunciated by those soft words are to be realised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When one turns to the government's policy platform in that respect, one finds it thin on detail and, in fact, contradictory in many respects, superficial in the extreme, and patronising of many of the advocates and spokespersons of small business. It takes their words and twists them in a way in which it might appeal on the broad front, without being specific to the particular policies and needs of the small business community. I want to go through some of those elements of superficiality and contradiction so that I can illustrate my point by resort to actual examples and detail. But, before I do, I make a couple of threshold observations generally about the economic approach of the government as enunciated both in the policy statements before the election and things that they have said since the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had today, at least by one or two of the speakers from the government, a reference to what they have styled for propaganda purposes&mdash;the so-called $8 billion Labor black hole in the budget. Of course, this is not true in the context in which it is now being used as a political slogan. It relates to forward estimates. It relates to a speculative possibility. It is, as I said after question time, a situation in which the Treasury notoriously is conservative about outcomes. Those figures change and will change come budget time, and they will change as the various parameters of the macro economy change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The figures are already different because of the most recent reported figures on inflation level outcomes achieved by the policies of Labor when it was in office. I do not think this furphy that is being used as the raison <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> d'etre for a sweeping axing of government services and cutting of jobs in the public sector&mdash;a reduction in efficiencies in the public sector and a withdrawal and reduction of services to people who rely on government services or industries that work with government&mdash;is justified in any way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe this furphy of this so&hyphen;called $8 billion black hole is being used to justify a slash and burn policy which will, in the end, dishonour the political promises made before the election by the then opposition. It will introduce Fightback by stealth and will undermine its commitments in the Medicare and health field, certainly in the education field and bizarrely in the field of employment generation. You don't have to believe all of them; you just have to see the credibility of some of the changes being foreshadowed, particularly in the employment area. By cutting employment and employment generation programs in order to reduce outlays, one cuts the ability of the government to help people find jobs to suit their skills. The government ran to the election on the basis that it is the party that can create employment. Now it is talking about cutting the very programs that will help deliver that outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well&mdash;this is my main point in economic terms&mdash;the cutting back of government programs in the economy as it is poised at the present time will have a dampening effect on business activity and therefore will start to slow economic growth. The anticipation is that in the second half of this year we will have strong economic growth. Maybe the judgment is being made on the government side that we can therefore absorb a few hits from massive government cuts. Irrespective of that judgment, the truth will be that it will slow economic activity and cause more unemployment then otherwise would have been the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us take the bizarre example of ripping about $1 billion worth of expenditure out of the acquisition of information technology. As is commonly understood and appreciated in business and in the Australian community, information technology is an enabler of greater efficiencies and a deliverer of different services&mdash;a greater choice in services and a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="181"> greater reach in service delivery. Chopping out $1 billion of expenditure will mean reducing the ability of a modern government to deliver up to the minute services in the best and most effective possible way and to save other costs elsewhere. It is a cutting off your nose to spite your face approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will also have a massive impact on Australian industry. Australia has the second largest IT, information technology, industry in the Asia-Pacific area. We come in just  behind Japan and ahead of every other country in the Asia-Pacific area. That has been built up because it was nurtured by the former Labor government with partnerships for development programs and a whole series of other things that have helped to build an indigenous Australian information technology industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Government purchasing was used to build that industry sector. By chopping out government services, by refusing to continue with an enlightened program of efficiencies generated by the enabling technology of information technology, we not only curtail or impair the ability of government to give to the taxpayers what they want and what they are entitled to but also stilt and stunt a major industry sector which is important to our future economic growth and which, if it does not grow apace, will mean that we will import the technology they would have created in Australia from overseas and blow out our current account deficit as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at factor F, which is the pharmaceutical area. We provide a payment to companies that produce pharmaceuticals in this country because they sell to the government and we peg the prices so there is no free market. We pay a bounty to them on the basis that they locate their research and development here, they locate their operations here, they export overseas and then attract a bounty. That compensates for the lack of a free market for them and has enabled a number of Australian pharmaceutical companies to grow and become world competitive at a time in which there is a rationalisation in this industry sector globally. But this has meant that we are a player. If you chop that bounty out, if you chop the factor F program <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> out, as has been widely reported will occur, you will therefore, again, undercut a major Australian industry sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I say these cuttings will dampen Australian economic activity and undercut business activity, I have described two clear examples of major industry sectors important to the economic development of a modern industrial state in which this government is moving in a regressive way. That is the first of my two thresholds. The second of my two thresholds is the oft cited and much bruited changes to industrial relations that the government has announced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the election campaign, the then opposition was very keen to sneak up to people and whisper quietly in the ear of the electorate, `Don't worry. We're not going to do anything that is going to hurt any individuals.' If you look at what detail we now have available, it is unmistakable that the impact will be the possibility that wages will fall across Australia because individual workers could be victimised&mdash;their wages could be put at risk, their living standards could be put at risk and their families could be put at risk because of those changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the government should pause here. It should not proceed any further. It should try to forge a better and deeper understanding with the Australian union movement about how these changes can go forth. It should not foist them on the union movement after nominal consultations in which there is no change or very little change based on the evidence that can be adduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government proceeds down the course that it has now embarked on, it will simply be inviting unions in this country to maximise their bargaining position before any legal changes are made, and that would be disruptive to the economy in itself. It would fracture our internationally recognised record of industrial peace and the genuine workplace cooperation that we have been able to build up over the years. It would also drive Australia down the New Zealand road of low wages but not high skill. It is the turning away from high skills and the embracing of the low wage concept that is, I think, at the base of these changes and, in economic terms, the worst <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="182"> element of them. It would penalise good employers who have built trust and confidence with their own work force by encouraging negative cost cutting by bad employers forcing the good employers to follow suit if they are to remain competitive. I urge the government to pause, to engage in genuine discussions, to recognise the strength and merit of the cases that can be adduced to show that progress here is being dramatically but cooperatively achieved, and to not unilaterally proceed now and fracture the industrial harmony that this country has obtained and carefully built and nurtured after many years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These changes that I have just referred to will affect all business&mdash;big business, medium business and, most of all, small business. This is why the government's rhetoric on small business is very empty. Let us look at what the government is proposing to do in terms of what it said before the election. I am not talking here about the rumours and leaks emerging out of the government in its run to the budget, but what it promised to do before the election and which one must have a full expectation it will try to deliver on. In the industry and science area alone there is to be a cost cutting of $270 million in programs that are key supports for small&hyphen; to medium&hyphen;sized business in this country. These are programs that are strategically targeted to meet the needs of small business, to help them flourish and grow in the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Take the innovation statement that the Labor government brought down in December last year. That statement is aimed at keeping Australian inventions in Australia, using our scientific and entrepreneurial ingenuity and generating investment in and the commercialisation of those inventions in this country. That program is now being swept aside. We can stand on the dock and wave goodbye to yet some more Australian technology, as foreign markets commercialise on our science and industry ingenuity. The innovation statement, which would have set up a national system of innovation for this country in a way that would have kept those inventions here, has been swept aside.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Take the empty rhetoric of the government when it talks about the need to increase trade and the need to work with Australian industry to do so. The government, according to its election platform, is proposing to cut the export market development grants and the other supports that are provided as financial incentives for companies to get into export. Export market development grants are fundamental and critical, particularly for small business. Small business cannot export without access to those funds. It encourages small business people to recover the costs of developing a market position in a foreign offshore market and it helps to defray some of the costs for them in going overseas to do that. By cutting those funds, we cut the penetration of these Australian companies into those markets and reduce our export effort accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the rumours about Austrade are true the international market intelligence system that this country has developed over the years to provide best knowledge about state of play in foreign markets across a whole range of industry sectors for Australian small&hyphen; to medium&hyphen;sized business will be significantly reduced. We will therefore be going blind in those markets. We will then be at a disadvantage compared to companies from other countries and we will not be competitive in anything like the way in which we now have a reputation for being.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the government has undertaken to do in the export area is, of course, unbelievable. Let us go further and look at the DIFF Scheme. This is a scheme for soft loans for Australian companies to develop in export markets. Two of the companies that spring to mind, being the biggest beneficiaries, are Clough Engineering&mdash;of course, the principal of that company is the President of the Liberal Party in Western Australia&mdash;and Transfield. The country in which most of these funds are expended is Indonesia, a developing country where we can use soft loans to get our infrastructure developers in to help develop the infrastructure of those countries. This scheme is going to be removed if the government's election undertakings are to be believed. Our penetration of the fast growing <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="183"> infrastructure market in the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region among the developing economies will be undercut. Jobs will be lost where jobs have now been gained, and companies that have become successful will be made marginal because of a lack of access to or an ability to rely on that scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can go further: research and development funding is to be reduced. We in this country have a great ability to invent things but we want to encourage more private sector research and development, and incentives are needed to do that. By cutting those funds, it means that we can come up with the ideas but we cannot develop them for the marketplace. If we cannot do that, we cannot take advantage of our capacity and win new markets in a fast changing international marketplace. That is a regressive change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The NIES scheme, which is delivered by Ausindustry, is to be cut. Every small business company in Australia knows about NIES. It is a scheme that helps small business, in a personal way, to develop business plans and marketing strategies. It is delivered with the state governments. The states will complain about this, and so they should, because they will have to bear the brunt of the reaction that comes from industry when this is cut. But this is also slated to be reduced. Let us move now to the diesel fuel rebate. If that rebate is abolished, it puts a tax on exports in this country and pushes the current account deficit further into the red.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us go to the tariff concession order scheme. We tidied up the tariff concession order scheme in our innovation statement, and we committed ourselves in the election campaign to consult further with the Australian business interests and the Australian industry organisations about that scheme. I think it is a good scheme and it ought to continue in its now revised form, the form we announced after the innovation statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australian industry&mdash;including the most prestigious industry organisations in this country, and some of the most conservative&mdash;is up in arms over this government's threats to cut this scheme. By cutting this scheme, we would make Australian industry less&mdash;not more&mdash;competitive in the world. You tie not <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> one but two arms behind their backs when they are in the international marketplace trying to compete with foreign companies by, in fact, imposing a tariff on the import of intermediate goods where there is no Australian producer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there is no Australian producer, then the tariff is not protecting any Australian company; it is just a revenue raising exercise. It imposes costs by increasing the price of those intermediate goods to the Australian companies that need those goods to produce a final product that can compete in the marketplace. So I think that that would indeed be a regressive step. They are some examples&mdash;I have to say they are superficially treated examples&mdash;of where I believe the slash and burn policy of the government is wrong in fact. It is wrong in principle, but it is also wrong here in application, because it does not go to improving the competitiveness of Australian industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It undermines the competitiveness of all industry, particularly small business, the ones who are most vulnerable, who have less discretionary time to protect themselves, who are overpressed and who need every assistance the government can provide to help them up the ladder. That is what these cuts do. These are not whimsical ideas by me; these are black letter commitments by this government when it was running in the election campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that the somewhat superficial remarks that have been made by the government should be set aside. These programs should be restored and there should be a real program of assistance for small business, not empty rhetoric, not fobbing off, not patronising industry leaders, not telling them what is good for them, but actually working with them to help build this economy internationally as a more competitive economy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the first opportunity I have had to offer to Senator Stott Despoja my congratulations on the presentation of her first speech earlier this evening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last Sunday, the people of Port Arthur, Tasmania, Australia, and indeed the world, suffered and witnessed a tragedy of unspeakable proportions. Times of tragedy often bring out the true character of people. Following this tragedy we witnessed the discreet and humble national leadership displayed by His Excellency the Governor-General in calling for the ecumenical service held in Canberra on Monday. All Australians would wish to thank His Excellency for his leadership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today I attended a state funeral service in Hobart. Prior to that service, families and friends of victims were invited to partake of coffee at Hobart's Hadley's Hotel. I was deeply touched and privileged to have been invited by the family of my friend Glen Roy Pears to be part of that gathering. As I was there, I observed their Excellencies, the Governor-General and the Governor of Tasmania, quietly and unassumingly move amongst the mourners offering the nation's and the state's sympathy. Their demeanour, their presence and their obvious sympathy made me feel proud of the heads of state of Australia and Tasmania. The community turnout today in Hobart and the messages were of great comfort and support to those of us who mourned. The flying of flags at half mast throughout the nation was a truly appreciated gesture of solidarity. So out of this tragedy, we can celebrate our unity, support and love for each other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it is with a heavy heart that I juxtapose these positive aspects of our national character with the behaviour of some within the Australian media. Let me preface my comments by saying that I believe in the freedom of the media. Having said that, let me say that that freedom, so unfettered as it is, demands that it be exercised with dignity and with responsibility. What I now say is said not in anger, but rather in genuine sorrow. But it was with revulsion and disgust that my fellow Tasmanians and Australians observed the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sharklike feeding frenzy the media are engaged in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Today</EMPHASIS> program sent Steve Liebmann to the front door of the Royal Hobart Hospital for sensationalism. Some of his comments, I have to say, left a lot to be desired. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> published a doctored photograph of the accused. Listening to its editor's defence on radio, I could not help but compare the standards the media apply to themselves as compared to those in public life. There were elements of the media that went doorknocking in the township of Port Arthur, wanting to get the new story, the different angle. There was no sympathy for the people, just the callous seeking out of an extra story, a different angle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were journalists stationed at the Melbourne airport gate lounges at which planes from Hobart were arriving. Journalists were calling out to the passengers, `Is there anybody on the plane that was at Port Arthur?' There were some people on those planes who had been counselled at the Qantas lounge before leaving Hobart airport for the trip back to the mainland, only to be confronted by those elements of the media not showing any concern or respect, but just wanting that angle, just wanting that story.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was no thought, no sympathy, no discretion. All those things were completely discarded for the sake of that story. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Frontline</EMPHASIS> has nothing on the tactics employed by the real media. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> best highlights my concerns. Allow me to give you an example of their absolute disregard for privacy. Glen Pears, my friend that I have previously mentioned has, as yet, not been positively identified, although those of us who know Glen have resigned ourselves to the worst. His remains have not been positively identified, but, really, in our minds there is no doubt that there is one remaining person and we believe that to be Glen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="185"> The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, undeterred by the fact that Glen had not been officially identified as a victim, sought to obtain a photograph of Glen from his family. This was officially denied them by their lawyer, Mr George Walker. Within 15 minutes of that denial a person identifying herself as a repre sentative of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> arrived at the Pears' home announcing that she was authorised to collect the photograph of Glen Pears. Unbeknown to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, the lawyer who had just told the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> no was in the Pears' residence. Suffice it to say, the person who alleged she had the authority was told to leave.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Undeterred, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> continued in their search for a photograph, although they knew that the family did not want any photographs published. What was their next port of call? It was Glen's former employer. They rang requesting a photograph from the staff file. His former employer quite properly sought the permission of the family. Do you know when that phone call was made? When they got home after the memorial service today. After that they received this call from his former employer saying, `The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> has made a request to release the photograph from the staff file; do you give permission?' Of course, it was denied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask those in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, `How do you think the family felt, having said, "No, this is our request, please respect it"?' They then, I would submit, deceitfully sent someone around to the Pears' home to try to get one. When that failed they went off to the employer. The family, in their grief after the state service today, was confronted by another request through the back door. Why did they do that? Was it out of respect to Glen Pears?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> and other media outlets that your insensitivity, your heartlessness and your crassness have done untold damage to your profession. The sensational, the biggest story, is the only priority it seems. This desire for the story rates above any other consideration. Next time you people in the media seek to criticise a trade unionist or an employer or somebody else in public life, I say, `Just look at yourself in the mirror and you will see an element of our community which is far worse than those that you seek to criticise&mdash;an element that has <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> failed to show respect, compassion, sincerity and empathy.' The story, the photograph and the sensational have been the motivator throughout. The ethics of journalism in this national tragedy have been found to be devastatingly wanting.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this adjournment debate to speak briefly about my recent attendance at the Inter&hyphen;Parliamentary Union Conference in Instanbul. I do so because it was the Senate which paid my fare, so I feel required to at least say a few words about my experiences there. I must thank the Senate in that regard because I found it a very stimulating and useful experience to be in Instanbul. I was lucky enough to be able to speak in the first plenary session. The speech that I gave was very well received, to the extent that the Japanese delegation decided to incorporate it in their report to the Diet in Japan.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having got such international notoriety, I thought it might be appropriate for me to provide it to the Senate here today. I will not go through it, but the first line says that I fear that parliamentarians are losing control of politics. I went on to talk about my experience in Papeete and Mururoa. I know that Senator Margetts, who was there, would join with me in saying that as a parliamentarian the experience of going with other parliamentarians who acted out of individual conscience rather than as representatives of their own governments was an unique experience and one which I think gave us all faith in parliamentary institutions and the power of individual parliamentarians as opposed to the power of bureaucrats or diplomats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, the speech was very well received. Having been to the Inter&hyphen;Parliamentary Union, I was given an opportunity to see the worth of that institution. I was asked to serve on the Cyprus committee, which deals with one of the most thorny problems of the Mediterranean or, indeed, the world. The IPU is the only international institution which talks to both sides of the people on the island of Cyprus. The UN can only recognise one side, but the IPU, in a spirit of genuine <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="186"> desire to find some common ground and some solution, is able to accept delegations from political parties on both sides. We were also able to have about half an hour with the Turkish foreign minister on that question. The IPU is also able to bring a better understanding of the issues of terrorism and things which might not seem so important to us, such as fish stocks, but which are very important to countries in the Third World.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to thank for the assistance I received Peter Keele from the Australian parliament and Pamela MacDonald from DFAT, who worked very tirelessly for our delegation to provide briefing notes and everything that we might require. She certainly seemed to know the face of absolutely everyone from the hundreds of delegates who came from all over the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The person I would particularly like to thank is the Australian Ambassador to Turkey, Mr David Evans, and his wife Pamela. He worked tirelessly on our behalf. He gave our delegation a sense of authority which I think was missing from some of the other delegations who were not quite so well supported. It was a pleasure from my point of view to be supported by someone so knowledgeable on the issues of not only that country but international politics in general. I would also like to thank his wife because too often we fail to recognise the efforts of the partners of people who do these difficult jobs for Australia. They are an unpaid member of the partnership but they are no less unstinting in the efforts that they go to to make people feel welcome and to provide very useful assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, as everyone knows, on these international trips there is an element of friendly ribbing between people from different political parties. Generally, there is a good feeling about it. There is said to be a 200&hyphen;kilometre rule about some of the conversations that are entered into in private but there is one I do not think anyone would mind me repeating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> We were taken by the ambassador through Istanbul to give us a feel of the place. We were passing a somewhat less than salubrious part of the city when the leader of our delegation, Steve Martin, commented that obvious ly things were not great for everyone in Istanbul; there was poverty, and so on. One of the Liberal members of our delegation said, `That's where all the battlers are, pal.' I replied, `Yes, they've probably got a photo of John Howard in every house.' One of the Liberals said, `Yes, and Mr Abbott as well'.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<TIME.STAMP>(7.38 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to commend Senator Abetz for his contribution to the debate on the adjournment. He raised some critical issues. Senator Abetz and I do not always agree but I agree absolutely with what he said tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to raise an issue which has been raised with me by a number of pork producers in Queensland&mdash;from Warwick, the South Burnett area and Monto. They have a number of concerns about their industry, particularly the prospect of more pork producers going out of business or being taken over.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A couple of their concerns involve the possible initiation of a couple of large piggeries in the Warwick area. One of them, already quite famous in this place having been mentioned quite often here by another senator&mdash;Danpork&mdash;could be starting a 10,000&hyphen;sow piggery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The producers want to know whether Danpork was given favoured treatment in terms of environmental responsibilities and controls. It wants to site its piggery only one kilometre from the Condamine River which, of course, is part of the Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the positive things about Danpork is that it claims to be creating 500 jobs through building such a super&hyphen;piggery in the area. But the pork producers, particularly in the South Burnett, asked me what point there was in creating 500 jobs if you lost 500 farms because of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have also raised with me the issue of the importation of Canadian pork. I certainly agree with the new Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Mr Bruce Scott, who for some years has raised this issue on behalf of the pork producers. I would like to mention a number of concerns that he has raised.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="187">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to place on record a number of company names and brand names which have been used to import, process and/or retail products containing Canadian pork. It is important that we understand this. The alternative is proper labelling laws so that consumers have a choice. I trust that the coalition will very quickly bring legislation into this place that will allow consumers to know what they are purchasing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the absence of such legislation, I inform the Senate that, as I understand it, Meapro of Sydney, which is sold through the Franklins stores, is one of these companies. Primo and Goldcob are two product brand names sold through the Coles stores. Duncan and Davis are processors of these products. Redlich, Ritter and Dyson, Melbourne manufacturers of ham and salami products, also process and retail imported Canadian pork.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My other concern is the health threat that Canadian pork still poses. I am happy to repeat some of the concerns raised by Bruce Scott in previous years. He called for a ban on all Canadian pig meat imports because of his concern about disease. He specifically talked about the threat of importing porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome, otherwise known as mystery swine disease, MSD. He pointed out that this is very prevalent in regions of Canada and results in a reduction of fertility rates, increased neonatal mortality and an increase in the prevalence and severity of other diseases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He pointed out that the infective agent is unknown and that the risk associated with the importation of fresh meat and frozen semen from Canada cannot be quantified. He was reported in a press release as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service has supported a ban against Canadian semen imports due to little being known about the disease's transmission but continues to allow the import of fresh pig meat.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While we readily import a possible diseased product from Canada a local meat works recently had a consignment of beef refused entry to Canada due to a lower class `G' in the kilogram measurement on the cartons.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is this kind of unequal competition which Australian producers have to face in the global market. I agree with Mr Scott when he <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> says that Australian producers pay a levy to the Australian Pork Corporation towards the promotion of the consumption and sale of Australian pork and that Canadian importers directly benefit from such promotion with no associated costs. Those are the issues that I want to raise; I could refer to many others, but I know that there are other speakers in the adjournment debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I again impress on the government the need for, in the least, proper labelling so that Australian consumers can make a choice for themselves about whether they want to eat an Australian product or imported products.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight on a very sad occasion. It is ironic that tonight Senator Wheelwright referred to the parliamentarians who last year travelled to Tahiti to participate with parliamentarians from many parts of the world to help in solidarity the French Tahitian people who were deeply concerned about the beginning of French nuclear tests again on their soil. When I came back to Australia from Tahiti, as soon as I could I fulfilled a promise to a woman I met in Tahiti, Marguerite Tetuanui, to present in the Senate a speech which she was to present to the Beijing Women's Conference. She was unable to attend that conference. A small section of her speech states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am not a scientific but I am sure that all the population of Polynesia die from cancer. My mother is dead from the cancer of stomach. My Brother Paul is dead from general cancer. My sister Celestine is dead from cancer of lungs. My sister Leonie is dead from cancer of lungs. My sister Liliane is dead from cancer of breast and my sister Madeline and myself had the cancer of the breast. Both of us have had operation; and thank God who (help) us and keep us alive.</PARA>
<PARA>I received a letter from another wonderful woman, Ahuura Paia, who spent much of three days with me and Kerrie Tucker, a member of the ACT parliament. Her letter states, amongst other things:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Dee,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . at this time: It is our sad duty to inform you of the passing of our Beloved Marguerite TETUANUI on the 23 April 1996 17.55 pm, Tahiti time. Marguerite fell ill a short time after you left us last <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="188"> summer. As a result Marguerite was unable to correspond with you. In March it was diagnosed as Cancer. Thankfully she did not suffer long.</PARA>
<PARA>I am appalled that we in Australia continue to supply uranium to countries who use it in nuclear weapons programs. This has gone on for too long. The brave people of this world, like Marguerite, who fought against the tragedies caused by nuclear weapons, should be commemorated. I hope that the work Marguerite has done will help the world to change its mind about the production of nuclear materials for nuclear weapons.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>
