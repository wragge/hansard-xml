<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to Senator Short, the minister representing the Minister for Finance. In view of the fact that the government will not rule out privatising Telstra by non&hyphen;legislative means, has the government instructed the firm CS First Boston, which will be conducting the scoping studies to establish the value of a privatised Telstra, to include in those scoping studies the value of the sale of a privatised Telstra by non&hyphen;legislative means? Would such a scoping study take into account: firstly, the payment of state stamp duty of between $1 billion and $2 billion; secondly, the non&hyphen;exemption of the privatisation process from the corporations law; thirdly, the requirement to issue a full and detailed prospectus; fourthly, that there would be no exemption from certain disallowable instruments; and, fifthly, that potential investors would not be certain of what liabilities they would inherit from the existing Telstra privatised by non&hyphen;legislative process?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I do not know the answer to the question as to whether the Minister for Finance has commissioned CS First Boston or anyone else. I will find the answer to that question for you and hopefully come back to you by the end of question time. There is a great deal of work done with any form of privatisation, even a partial privatisation. The whole question of due diligence and so on is gone into and I would expect that in any work done in relation to partial privatisation of Telstra the many issues that have to be considered concerning due diligence will be considered. Having said that, I will come back to you with a specific answer to your question.</PARA></TALK.START></ANSWER>

Do you concede that by privatising Telstra through non&hyphen;legisla <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> tive means the so&hyphen;called predicted value of $8 billion will be a substantially reduced figure because of the use of non&hyphen;legislative means compared with trying to privatise Telstra through legislation?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask Senator Herron, Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs: does the government support the social justice package and will the government be pursuing the implementation of recommendations in the social justice reports?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="1177" SPEAKER="Herron, Sen John" NAMEID="VW4" ELECTORATE="QLD" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VW4">Senator HERRON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government supports the social justice reforms, but not as committed by the previous Keating government. The government wants to see a focused and practical approach to social justice and we will be pursuing social justice objectives on a number of fronts, particularly in regard to improved health outcomes for Aboriginal people. The social justice reports include over 200 recommendations covering a wide range of issues. The government has asked ATSIC and the reconciliation council to pursue the implementation of appropriate recommendations in the course of their work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">ATSIC and the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation have been provided with $1.5 million in the 1995&hyphen;96 financial year to carry out this work.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Assistant Treasurer. In answer to a question from Senator Ferguson yesterday you said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RSAs will satisfy a market need: the option of a simple, low&hyphen;cost and convenient product. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Will you guarantee that under your superannuation model average fees and charges will <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> be lower for RSAs than currently exist for the average standard industry or employer fund?</PARA></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="1177" SPEAKER="Short, Sen Jim" NAMEID="DJ4" ELECTORATE="VIC" PARTY="LP" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the basic reasons for introducing RSAs is because there is no such product at the moment in the retirement income market. This fills a very important niche, especially&mdash;as I have said on several occasions in the Senate&mdash;for people who are part&hyphen;time or casual workers and move in and out of the work force, particularly women, and people who are nearing their retirement age. At the moment they do not have a vehicle of the nature of the retirement savings account.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So far as the accounts and charges in relation to RSAs are concerned, that is a matter that will be looked at in very fine detail as we work towards the final details over the period ahead in wide consultation with all the stakeholders. Certainly the intention will be to minimise the charges that will relate to such accounts. Indeed, it is one of the reasons&mdash;although not the only one by any means&mdash;why the government is moving to develop this new product to supplement the range of retirement income products. The former Labor government's attempt to solve the problem of the small numbers of superannuation accounts and benefits failed entirely.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Given that you are proposing to introduce a new type of product that will affect the savings of hundreds of thousands of Australians, possibly at least a million Australians, why can't you produce for the Senate those costs of the new product, which you continue to say will have lower costs? If the cost is going to be greater than the current administrative costs, will you legislate to ensure that the new product will in fact be cheaper, as you continue to claim but produce no evidence to support?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FF4">Senator CHAPMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also direct my question to the Assistant Treasurer. I refer the minister to the 1996 <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">World Competitiveness Yearbook</EMPHASIS> , which ranked Australia only 43rd, in terms of our current account balance, out of the other 45 countries surveyed. Can the minister explain the causes of this woeful performance? How will the government tackle this problem and how will this boost our competitiveness, growth and employment prospects?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="1178" SPEAKER="Short, Sen Jim" NAMEID="DJ4" ELECTORATE="VIC" PARTY="LP" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Chapman for that question. People who have read the press today will be aware that the 1996 <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">World Competitiveness Yearbook</EMPHASIS>  has ranked Australia&mdash;and this is on the basis of a ranking by thousands of business persons around the world; it is done by the International Institute for Management Development, a Swiss based survey firm&mdash;on the overall ranking as 21st out of the 46 countries surveyed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of our major trading partners and competitors rank above us. Many of the individual rankings are appallingly worse than even the ranking of 21st out of 46. Over the last 12 months of the former Labor government, we have slipped from 16th to 21st on that competitive rating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Chapman referred to our rating in relation to our current account performance&mdash;that is, our performance in terms of our external accounts. He is correct that the survey puts us at 43rd, almost right at the bottom of the league table, in relation to our external accounts performance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple fact again is that, although we have all known for a long time that the current account deficit problem facing Australia has been a major problem for Australia, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the former government in its 13 years in office was never prepared to tackle that problem. The result of course was lost jobs, lost investment, lost economic growth and, as noted by the competitiveness report, lost competitiveness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In simple terms the current account deficit is the amount by which national savings are insufficient to fund national investment and the difference is the amount we have to borrow from overseas to pay for our expenditure. The competitiveness yearbook indicates that our savings shortfall, as I have said, is the third worst of the other 45 countries surveyed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Economic commentators and governments around the world have increasingly recognised that high current account deficits can constrain economic growth. High current account deficits can lead to higher interest rates and make the economy more vulnerable to external shocks with the resulting loss and damage in the area of our national sovereignty that that brings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is particularly the case when governments contribute to the current account deficit by running irresponsible fiscal policies. The then Treasurer, Mr Keating, as I am sure we all remember, warned of the dangers of excessively high current account deficits 10 years ago in 1986, when he said that you cannot fund&mdash;and at that time it was a $12 billion a year deficit&mdash;that deficit in perpetuity every year and then the interest on that debt and on the debt before it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have seen under this government is a continual erosion of the dangers that the then Treasurer warned us of 10 years ago&mdash;a warning that the former government took no action at all to meet. Our policy, with regard to the current account deficit, is going to be based on action. It is not going to be based on the rhetoric that we have heard for the last 13 years. We will reduce the underlying budget deficit by $4 billion in 1996-97 and in 1997-98. We will not allow the Commonwealth to continue year after year to drag down national savings and compound the competitiveness problem that is so apparent in this report. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask a supplementary question, Mr President. Given the disastrous domestic economic consequences of Labor's 13 years of mismanagement that you have just outlined, what are the ramifications for Australia's independence and national sovereignty? Could the minister give further advice as to the government's approach to tackling this problem along with the domestic economic problems?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="1179" SPEAKER="Short, Sen Jim" NAMEID="DJ4" ELECTORATE="VIC" PARTY="LP" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Chapman is quite right in pointing to a non-economic consequence, in many ways, but a vital consequence of the types of economic policies that Labor ran during the last 13 years. What he is saying is that if you become increasingly internationally uncompetitive you run larger and larger current account deficits, you cannot pay your way through the world and therefore you have to borrow to fill the gap&mdash;and that is the foreign debt which the previous government ran up from $23 billion when it took office to no less than $185 billion when it lost office. There is no clearer way of losing one's sovereignty than in that sense.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also very interesting to note that two of the competitiveness report ratings that we failed most on were our international standing and our internationalisation&mdash;things about which the previous government boasted. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

Now that Labor's excellent showing in the by-elections held in New South Wales last weekend has forced the National Party to precipitate the PM's humiliating backdown on the diesel fuel rebate scheme and rural research and development, which he should have done ages ago, will you do the same for Australian industry and tell them that the DIFF and EMDG schemes will be maintained?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Minister, do you recall that some time ago former Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen had a problem with the doctrine of the separation of powers? Do you recall he did not seem to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1180"> understand that it is parliament which makes the laws and the executive which executes or maintains them? Do you agree that section 61 of the constitution restricts the powers of ministers to the execution and the maintenance of laws? As a cabinet minister, are you aware of section 9 of the Telstra act which states that all Telstra shares must remain in government ownership? So which particular law are you executing or maintaining in preparing options to sell Telstra out of public ownership without parliamentary approval? It is not the Telstra act, is it? Doesn't any plan to sell Telstra without parliamentary approval go well beyond the spirit of section 61 of the constitution?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

If we take it to its logical extreme, she is saying that we could not sell a filing cabinet without coming to the parliament first. Is she saying that the government is unable to sell any assets without seeking parliamentary approval first? It is a nonsense.

If there is another option, we might take that also.</PARA></TALK.START>

You have destroyed the credibility of the committee system in this place by indicating in advance you have no intention of listening to or taking account of the views that are put to this committee.

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DX5">Senator MARGETTS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services. The government's purchasing policy for paper encourages buyers to `purchase goods and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1182"> services with the least harmful environmental effects'. With the removal of the sales tax incentive on recycled paper for ordinary consumers, what impact does the government expect on the economic returns for post&hyphen;use paper collection for public and private sector collectors? What impact does the government expect on the export of used paper and the import of finished paper products? Will the government undertake a definite preferential buying program to support the purchase of post&hyphen;use recycled paper products wherever possible? Under the principles of competition policy and with current departmental budget cuts, how will environmental costs be incorporated into purchasing policy?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="1182" SPEAKER="Short, Sen Jim" NAMEID="DJ4" ELECTORATE="VIC" PARTY="LP" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think there were four questions there, but they really boil down to two. The first question was really asking what are the implications of the tax concessions on recycled paper&mdash;what concessions there are&mdash;and the second question was in relation to the government's purchasing policy. I think Senator Margetts's questions can be narrowed down to those two issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So far as the first question is concerned, since 1989, sales tax provisions relating to recycled paper products have changed considerably. Prior to 1989, recycled paper products did not attract any preferential sales tax treatment and were taxed at the general rate of 20 per cent. In 1989, an exemption was introduced for a range of recycled paper products. The scope of the exemption was reduced in 1992, as Senator Margetts will recall.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The then government agreed to provide transitional assistance to specialist manufacturers which had been disadvantaged by the decision from 1992-93 to 1993-94, after which the assistance ceased. The remaining exemption for certain 100 per cent recycled paper products was removed from 1 November 1995. Those products include writing, drawing or printing paper, envelopes, notepads, accounting journals and ledgers. The exemption was removed, as I understand it, Senator Margetts, because it proved an inefficient method of achieving the previous government's environmental objectives.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The removal of the exemption is consistent with the recommendation of the Industry Commission in its 1991 report on recycling. The report found in particular that the exemption was difficult to administer, that it provided no assistance to less than 100 per cent recycled paper products, that it provided incentive to divert waste paper from more traditional and efficient uses to the production of paper eligible for the exemption, and also that it impeded efficient industry development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In regard to the second question, in terms of the present government's purchasing policy, our purchasing policy for recycled paper products encourages buyers to purchase goods and services with the least harmful environmental effects consistent with value for money principles. Government buyers generally purchase their paper requirements through a common use arrangement.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You can answer it again if you like. This arrangement consists of a panel of approved suppliers who supply a range of paper products, including recycled products. The buyers guides issued to government buyers include as much information as is available from product evaluations and supplier information so that informed purchasing decisions can be made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no data on which to base any conclusions about the impact that the removal of the sales tax exemption might have on the economic returns of paper collectors or the export of used paper and the import of finished paper products. The government will continue its policy of encouraging buyers to purchase goods and services with the least harmful effects consistent with value for money principles. Value for money does remain the essential test against which any procurement outcomes must be justified. Value for money decisions, however, require consideration of all costs, benefits and alternatives, and environmental costs are an important part of the equation.</PARA></ANSWER>

Post&hyphen;use recycled paper replaces both imports and virgin pulp obtained by chopping down forests. We have a lot of used paper, and the biggest barrier to collection is the low price for used paper because of the lack of market.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the first eight years of privatisation of British Telecom, costs for business consumers fell, while costs for domestic consumers increased.</PARA>
<PARA>Why did she pick the first eight years after 1984? In other words, she quite selectively left out the last four years. What, of course, British Telecom pointed out to her in no uncertain terms is that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since privatisation to November 1995, the price of inland calls in the United Kingdom has been reduced by 53 per cent in real terms and 46 per cent for international calls. These reductions have resulted in business calls in the UK being 34 per cent cheaper and residential calls 33 per cent cheaper than Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>Secondly, she complained about all the dramatic staff cuts that there would be and she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For Telstra's efficiency to improve further, the route taken will be that taken by all newly privatised firms&mdash;sacking staff, forcing those left to work longer hours.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation is that, when the lot opposite had 13 years in government, while they spent up big in a whole lot of other areas they let the real value of defence expenditure fall, and the numbers have been repeatedly reduced. It was very clear that something had to happen to save the situation if Australia was to be adequately and effectively defended. So the then opposition, the coalition, put out a policy that said, `We will not cut defence expenditure; we will maintain the existing commitments.' I remember that during the election campaign the then minister, Senator Ray, was delighted. He actually talked, I think it was, on Adelaide radio saying he welcomed that; protecting the bottom line was a responsible decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the circumstances are that this government has come into government to find that the cupboard is bare; that the national budget is in a mess; that, if it were a housewife running this budget, husband probably would have sent her packing for the way she had managed the family budget.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me say quite categorically&mdash;because I want to address Senator Childs's throwaway line&mdash;there was no secret meeting.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that process, we had a Senate select committee inquiry, of which Senator Forshaw was a member. He will recall quite clearly that a lot of people put proposals to us about the development of Holsworthy. There was nothing secret; there was nothing underhand, nothing whatsoever. In fact, we had one classic proposal that Senator Forshaw will remember very well. That was for a floating airport off Sydney. The more responsible people who put proposals to us in regard to Holsworthy were the international pilots. That was one group. There was another proposal that I recall well, from a Mr Pickering, from somewhere around the North Shore. He put a very serious proposal to us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate inquiry, of course, had no terms of reference to look at an alternate site. What we did find was that, because of the government's procrastination and the delays in doing something at Badgerys Creek, there had been urban encroachment into Badgerys Creek. My understanding is that my colleague, Mr Sharp, has simply looked at an alternative to Badgerys Creek. If, in the event of a proper EIS&mdash;the Labor government had to be dragged into an EIS; it was a supplementary EIS&mdash;it is found that Badgerys Creek is not a suitable site, then an alternative has to be found.</PARA>

Though Senator Hill has come in today with one more batch of documents, it is quite clear that there are still more documents that need to be produced under the return to order. Senator Hill has not shown responsibility on this matter. He came in here on 22 May and, without investigating the matter at all, claimed that the record stands as Senator Minchin has presented it&mdash;without taking one look behind the documents to see what the real situation was. Yesterday, in response to Senator Faulkner, he said:</PARA></TALK.START>

This is just one example, but, Senator Hill&mdash;and I want you to listen to this&mdash;if you look at the return to order of a week ago, it did not just cover two ministers. It did not just cover the Minister representing the Attorney-General and the Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Short), to a question without notice asked by Senator Schacht today, relating to the proposed partial privatisation of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA>I appreciate the fact that Senator Short gave me further information at the end of question time about the appointment of CS First Boston. I was aware of that. I have been directing questions to you, Senator Short, because that appointment is the responsibility of the Minister for Finance, Mr Fahey. In the statement of 8 May he clearly appoints CS First Boston to carry out the scoping studies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no dispute with us that that process has gone through. Whatever the principles and issues of privatisation, it is a natural process to appoint a firm like CS First Boston to do it. That is not the issue I am raising. You were asked to get further information on the detail of the question. What I really want to find out is whether you have given further instructions to CS First Boston to do scoping studies on what the value of Telstra would be if it was privatised by non&hyphen;legislative means.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that Telstra would be substantially reduced in value if you privatised it by non&hyphen;legislative means. In particular, you cannot avoid the issue that if you do not put legislation through exempting the privatisation process from state stamp duty, between $1 billion and $2 billion&mdash;estimates vary&mdash;could be charged by state governments in stamp duty on creating a new corporate structure. That would clearly come off the $8 billion. If not, you might try to get this very large sum of money back in negotiations with the states by threatening to cut their states grants. That would then create an argument with the state governments. If you accept paying the stamp duty, you will be down at least $1 billion on the $8 billion. You will be down to under $7 billion in value.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I raised other issues&mdash;which all deserve an answer&mdash;about the importance for the parliament of knowing whether you were giving these instructions for the scoping study on exemption issues under the Telstra privatisation bill. The process of privatisation is exempt from the powers of the Corporations Act in a number of areas. We are not arguing that it is necessary for that to be done to make it simple but if you go the non&hyphen;legislative route you are not able to exempt, therefore the full power of the Corporations Act and all those things that go with it are part of the process. That could have a big impact on investors' attitudes and what they would be willing to pay for their one&hyphen;third share of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also the complicated issue concerning any disallowable instruments that affect Telstra but are in the Telecommunications Act. Where do they stand? Will they have an impact? If you go the non&hyphen;legislative route you cannot change those disallowable instruments. There is also the whole question of the existing liabilities that Telstra has&mdash;debt liabilities, borrowings&mdash;and how they would be dealt with in a non&hyphen;legislative way. For example, there is comment around that you cannot transfer the staff in the Telstra corporation to another corporate entity without their having some rights. How does that affect the value of Telstra?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Does the new investor have to pick up the debt which, under your bill, the Commonwealth accepts as liability? The debt of Telstra runs into hundreds of millions of dollars. All of that would reduce the value. We want to find out whether these things are in the scoping studies. If you are not putting them in the scoping studies, you are being quite irresponsible if you are going the non&hyphen;legislative route. There is a political issue here, Senator Short, that you have made great reference to. You have argued that there would be $1 billion out of the $8 billion going to the environment. If the stamp duty alone is more than a billion dollars and is paid to the states, that reduces the amount to $7 billion, or even less.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1193"> If you do go the non&hyphen;legislative route&mdash;no matter how much you get, it will be substan tially less than $8 billion&mdash;does the government still make an absolute commitment to put $1 billion into the environment program, or will that be substantially reduced, proportionately, because you are getting proportionately less than $8 billion?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Short), to a question without notice asked by Senator Margetts today, relating to recycled paper products.</PARA>
<PARA>I am afraid that Senator Short's answer probably was not on recycled paper. In Western Australia an inquiry into recycling stated in its executive summary:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Western Australia is committed to the goal of halving the solid waste going to landfill (on a per capita basis) by the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are unlikely to achieve that goal unless, as a community, we buy and use more recycled goods. We are, it seems, very good at collecting, sorting and stock piling recyclable materials, but fall down when it comes to creating markets for those materials by buying recycled products.</PARA>
<PARA>Under the `Key Finding' heading, the primary finding was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cost of recycled paper can be significantly reduced for Government by bulk buying through common use contracts.</PARA>
<PARA>Other findings were also quite important. I will read them out in good time. I just want to emphasise this. Basically it means that if each individual department makes its decisions one by one, it is never going to make that a more competitive buying option. That will not happen unless they have a proper policy that departments in general buy those goods and make a market that is worthwhile.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to emphasise that a major effort for local and state governments over the last 10 years has been to convince people, households and businesses to recycle. The reason for this is economic. It costs a dramatically increasing amount of money to throw things away. Tips fill rapidly and new tip sites are difficult to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> find within urban areas. Transport of waste out of cities to non&hyphen;urban sites is expensive. Small towns do not really want to become the rubbish tips of cities. Waste collection is expensive. Building new tips in an environmentally sound manner is often very expensive, especially if they are on top of a water mound. The situation has become critical enough globally that a few years ago the United States considered taking 10 per cent of its domestic waste and sinking it in a lagoon in the Marshall Islands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there are the ecological impacts of both waste disposal and of wasting material resources and the energy used to make them. In particular, paper is used and thrown away on a massive scale. We are chopping down our forests and chipping them. We are not doing it for building materials; we are doing it so we can make paper and throw it away. We are converting old&hyphen;growth forests into rubbish and filling our tips with it, and it is costing us a fortune. We chip timber and we send the chip and pulp overseas. We import paper. We spend millions to collect paper from consumers because the alternative is to spend millions to throw it in the ground.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The single biggest barrier to paper collection is the low price collectors get for paper. In many cases they cannot sell it in Australia. They have to sell it to Asia in competition with the United States and Canada, who also send wastepaper to these markets. This is absurd. We have resources, both forests and wastepaper, and we sell them cheap. We import paper&mdash;that is absurd. We spend millions to encourage people to recycle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The largest and most inexcusable component of urban waste is paper. The former government initially made recycled paper exempt from sales tax as an incentive to industry. It said it would remove the exemption when the Commonwealth shifted to virtually exclusive use of recycled paper, creating an Australian market. It has now removed the incentive to consumers and seems to be buying less and less recycled paper itself. It is abandoning the support of a recycled paper industry just as it is starting. The industry has started slowly, but it is here.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1194">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to differentiate between a couple of definitions of `recycled'. `Recycled' cannot mean simply cleaning up the scraps from paper making, the offcuts from pads and so on. The recycling we want and need is recycling the paper we encourage consumers to sort and recycle, the paper we collect. This is the paper we need a market for. This is the paper we need to recycle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of the hypocrisy of paper makers who do not use real waste, environmentalists have now had to start talking about post-use recycling to make it clear that they are talking about recycling real wastepaper. I think it is a disgrace that the Australian government does not actively pursue a purchasing policy with the express aim of ensuring that the paper it consumes&mdash;and we consume a lot&mdash;should be virtually exclusively post-use recycled paper.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been questions about whether recycled paper can be used in all applications. The Western Australian report dispels many of the myths about these problems. The `Executive summary' says:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman), to a question without notice asked by Senator Colston today, relating to the contribution of property sales to the defence budget.</PARA>
<PARA>I must say it is a very rare event that I comment on defence matters post-portfolio responsibility, but it was a classic example of a minister in this place spending four minutes in answering a question and one minute in answering a supplementary question while not addressing one word to the question that Senator Colston asked. You can make two assumptions here: either Senator Newman did not know what she was talking about or there <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is a scam going on about the defence budget that she did not want to reveal here today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Newman talked about the extensive cuts to the defence budget over recent years. The fact is that this federal defence budget has been reduced by 2.25 per cent in real terms over the last five or six years. That is a disappointment to me but, if you compare that with New Zealand that has come down 22&half; per cent in real terms, the United States that has come down 20 per cent in real terms, the United Kingdom that has come down 16 per cent in real terms and Canada that has come down beyond 15 per cent in real terms, one can see that it is quite a modest reduction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But Senator Colston's question to Senator Newman asked, in essence: will you keep your promise to sustain the defence budget in real terms and will you avoid the scam of reducing the budget but then forcing Defence to get into a round of property sales to make up the difference? For the last six years Defence has had the absolute right to sell property and retain 100 per cent of that revenue in its own budget in lieu of any increases to the defence budget because of constrained economic circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Hints have been dropped. Mr McLachlan dropped the hint on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS>, I think, that there would be more property sales. Senator Newman comes into this chamber on the question of RAAF base Laverton&mdash;and I do not disagree with what they are doing there&mdash;saying there will be property sales later this year. Those sorts of property sales are likely to increase over the next three years for one good reason: when the property market was down during my tenure in the defence portfolio, we resisted the temptation of bargain basement sales. We waited until the property market improved so that Defence could garner maximum revenue advantage from property sales. So for six years we have had a policy that any property sale that Defence undertakes&mdash;this is not equipment; we are talking about property now&mdash;all the revenue comes back to Defence and is reinvested.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple question today was: would the minister, on behalf of the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan), guarantee that they <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1195"> were not going to cut the defence budget and bodgie the figures through property sales? That was the essence of the question. We did not get one word of an answer on that particular matter. We still require Senator Newman to come back into this chamber later this week and answer that aspect of the question&mdash;and so she should.</PARA></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Sherry makes the point that Senator Newman is not here. I take a different attitude to that. I do not think ministers should have to hang around for noting of answers and quite often be bored to death for half an hour because, if they are doing their job, they should have other work to do. I do not take up your point, Senator Sherry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other curious factor was that there was no attempt to answer the second part of the supplementary question, which posed the question: will Defence get the benefit of the sale of land at Holsworthy if it transpires that that is the site for the second airport in Sydney? We know there have been secret meetings on this and secret plans made but, as I pick up the hint of that, much of those secret plans hinge on Defence having to cough up 20,000 hectares of land and hand it over to private enterprise for absolutely nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Think of the replacement cost that is going to go to the defence budget to replace the whole Holsworthy base. We have just put a storage revolution through the defence force centred on Holsworthy. Think of the effect on the property values of Wattle Grove, a model urban development, and think about replacing all that infrastructure; who is going to pay for that? If Holsworthy were to ever become the site, Defence would be entitled to a commercial return. I must stress that every time Defence buys property it does so with full tote odds; no&hyphen;one gives it a concession these days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead of filibustering for four minutes, making sexist comments about husbands packing their wives off, Senator Newman should come back into this chamber and give an additional answer on Wednesday or Thursday and answer this particular matter. If the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government does get up to a scam on this&mdash;and only if they do&mdash;I am going to pursue them time and time again until they actually reveal what they are up to.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to reinforce those comments by Senator Ray. In particular, I would like to add to what he said. I would be interested in whether you agree or not, Senator Ray; he is not  going to agree, necessarily. I thought it was interesting&mdash;particularly in the light of Senator Newman having said nothing at all about the matter of substance&mdash;that, when asked by way of a supplementary question to address herself to the question again and to take into consideration the prospects of land at Holsworthy, Senator Alston leapt to her defence. Interesting!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why would Senator Alston do that? He might want to get up here and say it was just a plain point of order about inappropriate supplementary matters but I think it says much more about the likely discussions that have been going on within the government about how you maintain the military budget as neutral. That is the point that Senator Ray has made and that Senator Newman is at pains not to answer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to take issue with Senator Newman filibustering about everything except the question at hand and, in particular, referring to the fact that if a woman&mdash;and I shall paraphrase because I have not got the exact quote&mdash;should run her budget like that it would be grounds for her husband to send her packing. Out of Senator Newman's mouth comes her true belief. Here she is, now representing the status of women for the Prime Minister of this country, sometimes getting up and answering dorothys from you over there about how significant the government is on behalf of women because of the extra number of women in the last election and how you believe in women like you never did before. But out of Senator Newman's mouth comes her true value.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here is a member of the Lyons Forum speaking. The only women you have are those who manage budgets for husbands. It never dawned on Senator Newman that a woman could mismanage a budget for herself&mdash;let <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1196"> alone any other sort of arrangement. Out of her mouth comes the idea that a woman who mismanages a budget can legitimately be sent packing by her husband. So, in the first place, the only status of a woman that Senator Newman knows is the married one and, secondly, this woman is totally dependent on a husband's judgment and if she mismanages a budget she can be sent packing. That is the language that a lot of us have opposed as the prior step to domestic violence.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also wish note the answer given by Senator Newman. I can understand Senator Newman wanting to create some noise and confusion in relation to the issue because, clearly, she had some difficulty dealing with the substance of it. But I have to confess that I find it offensive that she feels the need to make women in general the brunt of her attempt to divert the issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I found Senator Newman's statements to be quite offensive and I think a lot of people&mdash;a lot of women&mdash;also found her remarks offensive. I know it is reasonable for you to poke fun at women, that women are a weapon you can utilise; but I do not think that view is shared by the community at large. I made particular note of what Senator Newman said because, bearing in mind a lot of the comments made by the coalition frontbench, it was beyond the pale. She said, `If a housewife ran a budget like that, her husband would have the right to send her packing.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite reasonable to assume that there are families in which women still run a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1197"> budget. People in a family can divide up the chores in any way they think fit. What concerns me about Senator Newman's comment is not that it endorses the fact that some women carry out a budget but what it says about the relationship between a man and woman in a marriage. Clearly Senator Newman's comments rely upon an inequality in a relationship which allows the husband to determine the value of a woman&mdash;if she does not measure up to the values that her husband specifies, then he has the right and the option to discard her as he chooses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Newman's remarks rely on a power relationship within a marriage that allows a man to discard a woman as he chooses. That may be an acceptable proposition for some members of the coalition but it certainly is not an acceptable proposition as far as I am concerned. It is certainly not an acceptable proposition as far as the men and women of Australia are concerned. Most people see a marriage relationship as a relationship of equality, where one party does not have the right to discard the other at a whim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I am raising these matters, I wish to briefly mention some of the comments made by Senator Herron. I can see that this issue excites those opposite, because they have been very noisy this afternoon. Senator Herron clearly said that he does not know who was around him because he is used to being surrounded by beautiful women. On the face of it that is all a bit funny, isn't it, because it relies on a stereotype of women as ornaments, as baubles!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why would you remember that one woman was there and not another? Is it that what they have to say is of no significance, that you would not remember whether it were one woman or another, that their physical appearance is the only thing that is of any concern? I have the view that that is not the case and that women have a value in what they say and in what their ideas are. If a woman is present, she is entitled to be remembered because of the value of her contribution and not just because of what she looks like.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If ever the people of Australia needed a reason why Senator Crowley is no longer on the frontbench of the Labor Party and why Senator Neal should not be on the frontbench of the Labor Party, it is their duo performance this afternoon. Senator Jocelyn Newman is a very senior woman in an excellent government. What we have witnessed today, which is so typical, is two women attacking a successful Liberal woman&mdash;a woman who has achieved a lot more than the two of you together will ever achieve.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Jocelyn Newman has achieved the highest of offices within government in this country. Who does she get attacked by? Those people who parade themselves as feminists, with their hands on their hearts and saying, `We are looking after the cause of women.' But what do they do? They attack a senior female minister in the Senate for a bit of blood sport and for no other reason. Who was the person making the alleged sexist comment? It was a woman saying that, if a wife were to run a budget like that, the husband ought to send her packing. I assume, if Senator Newman had said that if a husband had run the household like that and the woman had sent him packing, that that would be okay according to those over there, because that is not politically incorrect.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a complete abuse of the procedures. It shows that these two senators over there do not carry a chip on their shoulder; they carry a boulder, and I think they use it as a head from time to time. The point Senator Newman was making was that the Labor Party were in government, they set a terrible budgetary strategy and the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1198"> people of Australia sent the Labor Party packing&mdash;they did not want you anymore because of that. So the Labor Party, instead of addressing their economic failures and finally acknowledging the reason why the people of Australia did not vote for them, set up this smokescreen&mdash;absolutely pathetic and quite disingenuous&mdash;by two female senators to attack a female minister in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party is really going to the depths of despair when they have nothing else to attack us on but some throwaway line to highlight their economic incompetence. Instead of defending their record, which they cannot do, they try to launch an attack. It is the old policy that attack is the best form of defence. So they drag out the limp lettuce brigade of Senator Crowley and Senator Neal to try to bash Senator Newman over the head with a limp lettuce. It has had absolutely no impact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We get to hear all this nonsense about political correctness. I just hope Labor Party senators keep talking in the way they have been. I hope that on broadcast days Senator Crowley and Senator Neal continue to talk in the way they have been. If they do, we will be assured of being on this side of the Senate for many, many years to come.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In speaking to this motion I make the point right at the outset that this is not just another motion of the Senate. This motion raises an issue which goes very much to the core of the constitution of this place and is one which needs to be addressed. It is important because, unless we address it, as we have said consistently over the last few weeks, the status of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1204"> decisions taken by this place could very easily be called into question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not a question of numbers in the Senate, because we have made it clear that we would ordinarily provide a pair in these sorts of circumstances. This is putting the Senate on notice about the possible incapacity of one of our future members to hold a position here, the consequences of a doubt over that particular person and the impact that that doubt would have on the process of this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first point that needs to be addressed is that the responsibility is primarily on the government. Over the years when issues like this have been raised ministers responsible for electoral matters have taken the initiative and have referred matters like this to the Court of Disputed Returns of the High Court. It is quite apparent that in this particular instance the government is shirking its responsibility. Not only are they not prepared to send this matter off, but they have taken a consistent attitude all the way through of obstructiveness and deceptiveness on this issue, trying to conceal facts and not face the music.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that, and the fact that it has taken us so long to get documents from the government about this matter&mdash;and we believe there are still more to come&mdash;we believe that there is no other option but for the Senate to confront this issue. It is up to us; it is part of our responsibility and is very clearly within our ambit of power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is at question here is whether there has been a breach of section 44 of the constitution. Section 44 of the constitution is that particular provision which ensures that a person who holds an office of profit under the crown shall be incapable of being chosen or of sitting as a senator or member of the House of Representatives. That is the issue that we raise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of that issue, there are three component parts that need to be addressed. The first is whether a senator-elect is a person who comes under the ambit of section 44 of the constitution&mdash;that is, whether the period when a person is a senator-elect is covered in the constitution. It is our contention that Senator-designate Ferris has a number of problems in respect of that issue.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government would have us believe that there is advice from a QC saying, `Everything is all right. She's Jack, mate.' But it was the government's own Minister for Administrative Services, Mr Jull, who on 3 April this year wrote to Senator Minchin and basically said, `Hold your horses. Don't go ahead with this appointment.' Why did he say that? Because he had invoked the advice of the Attorney-General in the previous Liberal government, Senator Durack, and he had invoked the precedent set by a current senator, Senator Michael Baume.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Senator Durack's letter, which Senator Hill and others on the government side refuse to acknowledge exists, he made it very clear that the period when a person is a senator-elect is a period which falls foul of section 44 of the constitution. For those on the government side who are experts and have spoken in this debate but have not read the letter, I refer them to page 3 of Senator Durack's advice, where he says, and I quote him in full:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although I appreciate that the matter is one on which a different view can be taken, my own opinion is that section 44 is applicable to senators&hyphen;elect. I have concluded that not only is this the safe view to adopt, but that it is also the correct one.</PARA>
<PARA>I was fortified, obviously, on seeing the advice of the Clerk of the Senate, Mr Harry Evans, on this point. Mr Jull wrote to Senator Minchin on 3 April. He referred him to Durack's advice and then said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I should add that the issue was raised again in 1984&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I should add that the issue was raised again in 1984 by Michael Baume who was contemplating working on the staff of the then Deputy Leader of the Opposition between the time of election and commencement of his term as Senator. On receipt of advice along similar lines to that provided in 1980, he decided not to proceed.</PARA>
<PARA>What has been the government's response to this advice? It has been twofold. They con <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1205"> tinued with the appointment and withdrew it only on 19 April, some 16 days later. They then tried to argue that these passages in these letters&mdash;including the one from their own minister to their own parliamentary secretary&mdash;did not exist. But they did invoke the advice of a Christine Wheeler QC. We do not know much about Christine Wheeler. She is probably a very good lawyer.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What we also do not know&mdash;and what you do not know, Senator Alston, and you should know before you rush to judgment on this&mdash;is what has been given to Ms Wheeler. We do not know what documentation she has been given, what she has been asked to provide and what point she is actually addressing. We also do not know when she was asked, and that is a critical point in this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have got the documentation, and we know that that documentation was only pulled together over recent days. If the Wheeler advice was provided before Senator-designate Ferris took up her position, it would be irrelevant now. That advice would be irrelevant because this documentation undermines the position Ms Wheeler took as she did not have it before her. We have it, Mr Evans has it and most commentators have it. So there are huge problems for Senator-designate Ferris to face in respect of section 44's relevance to senators&hyphen;elect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other question is whether the office Ms Ferris took is an office of profit. There is much documentation we can go to on this, but all I have to do is refer senators to Senator Vanstone's answer on 22 May to a question we asked on 1 May. She made it very clear in her response that the position that Senator-designate Ferris took was an office of profit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So two legs are covered. I know Mr Evans has raised a few other legs about which he is satisfied, but the leg which is of real relevance to the Senate today is whether Ms Ferris worked in that position. This is where the scam on the government's part starts&mdash;the cover&hyphen;up starts here.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It makes you wonder why Senator Minchin was stupid enough to pursue this route in this way. You can understand how Senators Vanstone and Short fell for it. It was a lack of understanding of the issues, a lack of interest and a lack of application on their part. What you cannot understand is why Senator Hill took exactly the same attitude to his responsibilities as Senators Vanstone and Short did. Senator Hill rushed to judgment early in the piece. On 22 May he came in here and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Minchin . . . openly explained exactly what the circumstances were in relation to this matter&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>And he came in here yesterday and made similar points. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What I can tell you is that we went to great trouble to ensure that they were.</PARA>
<PARA>What did this `great trouble' extend to? Did he go through the documents? Did he make sure they were all available? Did he check with his own department? Of course not. What did he do? He spoke to both ministers in the other place. Great! He probably does that every day. We are not satisfied that Senator Hill has met his responsibilities here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has been consistent through this approach has been the government's attitude; it has been underscored by their intention to tell the Senate as little as possible. The issues are these: did Senator&hyphen;designate Ferris hold the job? Can we pretend that it did not happen? And can we pretend that she did not spend any time working for Senator Minchin in a paid capacity?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Government senators could have fronted the music. They should have realised that, under freedom of information legislation and under a return to order, they would have to produce the documents. But being immature, naive and arrogant, they decided, `We'll just tell the Senate what we want to tell them. We'll put a great spin on the documentation and we'll get away with it.' It was a spin even greater than Shane Warne could have achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next issue is the government's dereliction of duty. Government senators were asked a number of questions on 1 May and they could have answered them the next day. All the information we have had&mdash;apart from the cabcharge documents produced today&mdash;was <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1206"> available to the government on 1 May. That is all indicated in the documentation. All of that information&mdash;apart from the legal advice, which they never gave anyway&mdash;was on the record. But it took them 19 days for an answer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did we get after 19 days? We had Punch and Judy over there&mdash;Senators Short and Vanstone&mdash;trying to give each other responsibility for providing the answer. What did they do? In their confusion they gave us the wrong answer. They gave us the answer to another question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then, of course, we come to Senator Short. Senator Short was asked on 9 May by Senator Colston to provide information&mdash;information which was available on 2 May. What did he do? On an issue which was of public notoriety for at least a week, which had been run in quite a number of newspapers, and for which I would submit very firmly that he had a brief, he said, `I have no information.'<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Government never worked liked that before 3 March&mdash;and I am sure he did have information available to him. So why did he not produce it? Because, once again, they were buying time. They were hoping the issue would go away. They were hoping a deadline would cut this particular issue off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Hill has been exposed today for his dereliction of duty in not meeting his responsibilities here by not producing all the documentation. I say to you again, Senator Hill: the return to order covers the department for which you have responsibility, and if you do not front with those documents, then you are capable of an even bigger sin. But let us go to the person who represents the Attorney&hyphen;General in this matter.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="HILL" NAMEID="BH4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What department?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister's department. If you want a basic lesson in politics, Senator Hill, Senator Minchin is the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister.

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I drafted it myself, Senator Hill. And, given your performance on this particular issue, I suggest that you go back and read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  and meet your responsibilities. The return to order covers the parliamentary secretary as well. If you do not know that, Senator Hill, you have been showing less interest in this matter than even I could imagine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But then we go to Senator Vanstone&mdash;and don't we get close to the pinnacle of arrogance and lack of responsibility to this place with Senator Vanstone. She gave us an answer on 20 May and she told us everything was all right. But the statement was enormously misleading. At the particular time that Senator Vanstone gave us the answer a whole lot of documentation was available and relevant to the issues before the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why did she not mention that there was a signed work agreement? We can understand why Senator Hill did not know yesterday that there was a signed work agreement&mdash;because he does not take an interest in these matters. But Senator Vanstone had a responsibility to check. She never mentioned a signed work contract. She never mentioned the salary had been paid and refunded&mdash;and, in fact, 13 days had been paid, three days refunded and 10 days taken back by DAS. She never mentioned air travel was paid and refunded&mdash;travel allowance. She never mentioned that an amount of $9,441.45 had been paid back.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why did she not mention the letter of David Jull, the Minister for Administrative Services, of 3 April, quoting Durack and Baume, but mention the advice of QC Wheeler? Because she tried to mislead the Senate into believing that Senator&hyphen;designate Ferris never really worked for Senator Minchin. Why did she not mention, for instance, the wage increase? On 1 April, some 13 days after being in one job, Senator&hyphen;designate Ferris wakes up and finds out that she has been reclassified to a position which gives her $49,000 instead of $40,000 per annum plus the ministerial overtime allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why did Senator Vanstone not mention that meetings were held on 3 and 11 April and Senator Minchin was advised not to go ahead with the appointment? Why did she not <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1207"> mention that letters of 19 April withdrew Senator&hyphen;designate Ferris from employment, and no action had been taken for some 16 days after the bells were made to strike in Senator Minchin's office?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have to ask Senator Vanstone: did you check your facts? Or are you showing the same degree of application and interest in this matter as you have shown in the tertiary education sector? You have to ask Senator Short as well whether he checked his facts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How could Senator Vanstone have said on 20 May, `Ms Ferris has not at any relevant time held an office of profit', when all this documentation was available and there were enormous problems with her status here?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then, of course, we get to Senator Minchin. He is a person who, I believe, has clearly misled the Senate and should not hold the position that he is holding. In April this year Mr Howard issued a guide on key elements of ministerial responsibility. In one of the key points of ministerial conduct on page 10&mdash;and this applies to parliamentary secretaries and ministers&mdash;he says,`They must be honest in their public dealings and should not intentionally mislead the parliament or the public.' So much for this document!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did Senator Minchin do? He made the first mistake by employing Senator&hyphen;designate Ferris. Any political operator knows that you do not employ a person who is a senator&hyphen;elect. His second mistake was trying to cover up&mdash;the payback scenario, trying to make out that nothing was going to happen and nothing was going to come out. The third mistake he made was to mislead the public in telling journalist John Ferguson and the public of South Australia through the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> on 23 May that this was a `volunteer' position. His fourth mistake was making his colleagues take the rap&mdash;Punch and Judy over there, Vanstone and Short and Senator Hill in front of us. They have been asked&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I withdraw. Senator Minchin has made them take the heat, he has made them look silly and he has made his leader look silly as well&mdash;and he has misled the Senate. When he came in that day to make the statement about Senator&hyphen;designate Ferris, he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I seek leave to make a statement relating to events surrounding the volunteer work&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>volunteer work&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">currently being undertaken in my office by South Australian Senator&hyphen;elect Jeannie Ferris.</PARA>
<PARA>Volunteer work! No matter what spin you put on her work in the office of Senator Minchin, you could never call it `volunteer' work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He proceeded to employ her straight after the election. He has proceeded to argue that she worked in a volunteer capacity so they could avoid the law. But there is absolutely no way you could define the word volunteer to include a job for which there is an employment agreement dated 18 March&mdash;an agreement which says quite specifically she should be paid, and the terms and conditions of which are the same as equivalent classifications in the Public Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He signed a letter on 18 March, `To whom it may concern'&mdash;to the whole world&mdash;saying that she would be employed for the period from 18 March to 28 June on an ASO6 salary of $40,080 plus an MSA of $11,200. He then wrote to the Prime Minister's office, once again indicating that she would be employed from 18 March to 28 June, and he noted that Senator Ferris was a `Senator&hyphen;elect'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How stupid can you get? Thereafter, on 25 March he writes to Mr Jull, the Minister for Administrative Services. He states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wish to advise that I have appointed Ms Jeannie Ferris to the position of Assistant Adviser.</PARA>
<PARA>As if that were not bad enough, Senator Minchin, having made his fourth strike there by signing her on in terms of her employment, on 1 April reclassifies her and sends another letter putting her salary up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We then go to the trips. There were 12 trips in some 22 days: Adelaide to Canberra, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1208"> Canberra to Adelaide, Adelaide to Perth, Perth to Adelaide, Adelaide to Canberra, Canberra to Sydney, Sydney to Brisbane, Brisbane to Sydney, Sydney to Darwin, Darwin to Adelaide, Adelaide to Canberra, Canberra to Adelaide&mdash;and it goes on. She had to pay back all the money expended for these 12 trips. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But not only that; the work contract provided that she pay for superannuation as well. This is a person who, we are told, did not hold employment, did not hold the job. Not only is it in the agreement that she take up superannuation&mdash;that is, the agreement dated 18 March&mdash;but it has come to light now that some time on 28 March Jeannie Ferris, office of the Senator, the Hon. Ian Minchin, gets a note from the Department of Administrative Services, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you wish to re&hyphen;commence contributions to the PSS please fill out the following 2 forms &amp; return to the Parliamentary Personnel Section ASAP.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Maria</PARA>
<PARA>You do not take a job, get $49,000 a year, 12 trips in three weeks, superannuation, and then call it a volunteer job. Then she got paid in the job $512 for three days, which is all that Senator Minchin has admitted to. But then there was $1,391 for another 10 days, 21 March to 4 April&mdash;money that had been paid in and withdrawn by the Department of Administrative Services. So she was paid $1,903 of which she paid back $512 and of which the department took back $1,391.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Minchin claims that she only got paid for three days. I said to him, `Did you mean three weeks?' He said, `No, three days.' She got paid for 13 days, not three days. He says that she rejected and returned payment of three days salary. She did not reject it; she accepted the three days salary and spent it, and she expected more. She rejected the 13 days salary. She gave $1,903 salary back, plus $3,421 in one cheque&mdash;and we do not know where that came from&mdash;$800.05, $3,317. All up, some $9,441.45 was paid back by or on behalf of Senator-designate Ferris&mdash;not the $512 that Senator Minchin talks about. There is absolutely no way you can define `volunteer' to include $49,000 per annum, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> plus super, plus everything else that we are on about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What else does Senator Minchin do? I think he misleads the Senate when in his statement he says that Mr Jull said to him, `Make up your own mind.' In that letter of Jull's of 3 April, Jull makes it very clear that Durack's advice is that you make your own decision but section 44 is applicable to senators-elect, and not only is this the safe view to adopt but also the correct one. Mr Jull also documents Senator Michael Baume's experience here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So is it not curious? With all this documentation on the record, Senator Minchin comes in and tries to explain it away as a volunteer job. And Senator Hill, leading from behind, says `Well, I will follow my leader Senator Minchin; whatever he says is right.' It is not right. Any person with any understanding of legal processes would have realised that under FOI, under the return to order, they would have been sprung&mdash;and that is precisely what has happened here now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can ask Senator Minchin: why did you put her on in the first place, given that her CV shows absolutely no recognition of any experience in native title? More particularly, having put her on, having had the briefing and the letter from Minister Jull on 3 April, why did you keep her on until 19 April? Why did it take until 19 April for you, Senator Minchin, to take some action and for Senator-designate Ferris to withdraw from the position?' Curiouser and curiouser it gets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why did not Senator Minchin in his misleading statement acknowledge that there was a work contract? Why did he only mention three days, not all the time? Why did he not mention his letter of 25 March where he wrote that he had appointed Senator-designate Ferris? Why did he not mention all the other letters, the travel allowance and the travel expenditure? None of this was mentioned in Senator Minchin's statement. Why did he not mention that he and Ferris met with DAS on 11 April 1996? Why did he not mention that he put up her pay on 1 April? Why did he keep her on after 3 April, after Jull's letter? Why did he keep her on after 11 April after they met with Mr Semmens of the Department of Administrative Services? Why did he <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1209"> not mention that she had signed up for super? Why did he not mention his and her letter of 19 April regarding the job?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do have here a consistent attempt by Senator Minchin to cover the facts. That is why our motion does not just go to the position of Senator-designate Ferris but it also goes to the position that Senator Minchin has played in this particular matter. You see, Madam Acting Deputy President, this particular scam has stung two people. Not only has it stung Senator&hyphen;elect Ferris, but Senator Minchin's reputation as a political operator, I think, stands pretty well in disrepute at the end of this particular process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Section 352 of the Electoral Act makes it very clear that any particular person who may have been involved in an offence under the act relating to disqualification&mdash;and the offence here, Senator Chamarette, is under section 163 of the act and section 44 of the constitution. The law provides that anyone who has been involved in the way that Senator Minchin has been also has some implications to worry about. Section 352(2):</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I could take honourable senators through that advice and, in effect, paraphrase that advice, but I do not think that would add anything. The document will stand for itself. It is advice that has given us comfort. In fact, there is no problem in relation to Senator&hyphen;elect Ferris. Furthermore, it is advice that should give discomfort to you, because it means that you are seeking the resolution of this chamber with the prior agreement of the Greens and the Democrats. This is not surprising because we have not had a vote in this place in these sittings in which the three opposition parties have not joined together. Obviously, the greater caucus has also joined on this, determined that Senator&hyphen;elect Ferris should be dragged off to the High Court and put through all that discomfort and cost to your amusement. Obviously, the three parties have decided to move in that direction, and that will be the end of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other interesting issue is the basis under which the Senate is seeking to require this matter to be determined by the Court of Disputed Returns, namely, section 376 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. I do not <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1212"> know whether Senator Bolkus has bothered to read this section before he drafted his notice of motion. If he had read the section, he would have found it to say, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any question respecting the qualifications of a Senator or of a Member of the House of Representatives or respecting a vacancy in either House of the Parliament may be referred by resolution to the Court of Disputed Returns by the House in which the question arises and the Court of Disputed Returns shall thereupon have jurisdiction to hear and determine the question.</PARA>
<PARA>Madam Deputy President, when I referred to Senator&hyphen;elect Ferris, do you know why Senator Ray interrupted and said, `No, Senator Ferris'? He did this because he is trying to claim that she has already taken office. He is claiming that she is already sitting here. Senator Ray is forgetting that South Australia already has 12 senators sitting here. At least he is a step ahead of Senator Bolkus&mdash;but then again, Senator Ray probably drafted the notice of motion for Senator Bolkus. Senator Ray seems to be drafting most of the questions, notices of motion and other procedural matters for the opposition at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To succeed in terms of the legitimacy of taking this matter to the Court of Disputed Returns it either has to apply to a senator or there has to be a vacancy&mdash;and in this instance there is neither. There is a provision in the act for petitioning, which would have been the correct and proper procedure at this time, when she is neither a senator nor is there a vacancy. Unfortunately, the opposition have not said it yet but they may also suffer some procedural deficiency in relation to that provision of the Electoral Act. But that is irrelevant because they have not chosen to go down that path.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Harradine and Senator Bolkus know that the correct procedure is out of time. Therefore, those opposite have come up with this exotic interpretation of section 376 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act in an attempt to drag Senator&hyphen;elect Ferris off to the High Court sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns. They have no basis to get her there. On the best legal advice that we have, there is no difficulty in her position. She is eligible and should be able to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> take her seat. They are not interested in the quality legal advice because, as I said, this is simply a political exercise for short&hyphen;term political gain.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sorry you have dragged the Australian Democrats and the Greens into this rather dirty, little, political exercise, Senator Bolkus.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats are an amazing political party. Senator Kernot says there is a problem because there is really no reason why somebody should not be employed during this period of their election and taking office. Nevertheless, when it comes to the vote and the ALP says, `Put up your hands,' the Democrats say, `Of course, we are part of the family; we will meet the commitment you require of us despite the fact that we have introduced private member's bills to try to counter what we say is a deficiency.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the Democrats want to be part of dragging this person off to the High Court, at great expense and at great stress to her.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to place on the record where the Greens are on this issue. We are yet to hear from the government any serious arguments against some of the principles that have caused us to tend to support the first part of this motion. I would like to say that for us there are three issues here: firstly, the question regarding Senator-elect Ferris's eligibility or disqualification; secondly, whether an offence has been committed by her in knowingly doing something that disqualified her; and, thirdly, whether another senator has also been implicated in any offence which may or may not have occurred.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Greens agree with the first point, but we do not agree with the second or third points. We believe there is a question to be asked. There is doubt about the eligibility of Senator-designate Ferris. It is far too complicated an issue for us to be prepared to make a determination. We believe that it clearly is appropriate for referral of the matter to the Court of Disputed Returns. We did puzzle at length about whether it was appropriate for the Senate to do that. We believe it is the Senate's responsibility to do so, not simply because it has been brought as a matter to this place and to ignore that would be negligent, but also because of section 376 of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1214"> Commonwealth Electoral Act. We believe that the Senate must ensure that our processes are correct and transparent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It causes the Greens no joy whatsoever to support the first part of this motion. All of us have experienced the anxiety&mdash;and impatience in some cases&mdash;about coming into this place. I certainly feel that the issue of coming here is one we all remember. I had to wait for a state government to appoint me and I was here for two weeks observing what was going on in the place without being able to take up the position which was then made possible by the actions of the state government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that there is a question about whether sections 44 and 45 of the constitution have been breached. Because of section 47 of the constitution and section 376 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, I believe it is quite clearly indicated that the Senate holds a responsibility in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that Senator-designate Ferris is not a senator. Whether she is to be regarded as a candidate or a senator-elect is unknown to me because the writs were issued after she was holding a position which may or may not be regarded as work or taking profit under the Crown. Therefore, I believe there are questions. Did she hold an office? Was it an office of profit? Was it an office under the Crown? Does the prohibition on being chosen and on sitting as a senator apply? Was her election void? Did her place become vacant? I do not know the answers to any of these questions. I believe the Court of Disputed Returns is the only appropriate place to make such a determination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, we do not find it clear that the question does not need to be asked nor do we find it clear that the second and third points implied in this motion are valid&mdash;that some offences were committed by Senator-designate Ferris or by any other senator who is assumed to be, in the words of the motion, aiding and abetting. We assume that is directed to Senator Minchin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not agree that those points should be included in this motion. In fact, the second and third points, whether an offence was knowingly committed or whether an offence of aiding and abetting was committed, stand <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> or fall on the determination of the Court of Disputed Returns. As I have already declared, we have no idea what determination the Court of Disputed Returns is going to make. Therefore, in our view, it is inappropriate to pre&hyphen;empt the Court of Disputed Returns. We do not believe it is inappropriate to refer the matter. In fact, we believe it is the Senate's responsibility and role to protect its own membership and to be seen to be clear and above board on those matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is inappropriate, in our view, to blur the legal and the political in the way that this motion does. The Greens (WA) are not interested in party political witch&hyphen;hunts nor are we interested in evading party political witch&hyphen;hunts. We believe there is a case to be raised in the Court of Disputed Returns. Unless there is some sufficient argument that causes us to reconsider&mdash;and I am still listening to the course of the debate&mdash;we are prepared to support paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this motion but we are going to move an amendment to remove paragraphs (d), (e) and (f) from the motion.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did note that Senator Chamarette said that she still had an open mind, to the extent that she was prepared to listen to the debate. I simply want to say this: I am very pleased that you have not supported the second half of this motion, because the critical word in it is `knowingly.' That is the consequence of it. It talks about aiding and abetting, and borrows the words of section 353. `Knowingly' is the critical term, because you have to have contravened the electoral act, the Crimes Act or the regulations. You have to have done it knowingly. In other words, you do not do it accidentally; you do it deliberately.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You only have to reflect for a moment that no&hyphen;one in their right mind would put at risk a position in the Senate, in order somehow to pick up a couple of extra days pay. What would happen, and what happens perhaps too frequently, and what is the basis for the Australian Democrats private member's bill of 1992 and the Cleary case and others, is that people accidentally do it. Sometimes they take advice that they are in the clear, but they <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> still fall foul of the rules. No&hyphen;one, I would suggest, knowingly would embark on such a short&hyphen;sighted venture. So I think you are perfectly correct in saying that these three paragraphs do not apply, but you should not say that the outcome will depend upon the ruling of the Court of Disputed Returns, because there is still not a skerrick of evidence that anyone knowingly sought to commit an offence.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is the point. You do not understand. You are talking about getting at Senator Minchin. We are talking about the second half of this motion. This is aimed at Senator Minchin. It is Bolkus overkill, pure and simple. It is just an attempt to put sleaze on sleaze. If ever anything was abundantly clear, it is that Senator Bolkus for once was telling the truth when he said that he drafted it himself. It is clearly his own work; otherwise you could not possibly have even contemplated putting those particular provisions on the table. The worst part about it is that even the first part of it is deficient. This is where I would very much hope that Senator Chamarette will simply focus on this issue for a moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For our purposes, there are two stages under the electoral act: one is when you are a senator&hyphen;elect and the other is when you take your place. You become a senator on 1 July, even though you have not been formally sworn in, which is when you sit. It is before and after 1 July that is critical in this exercise. They had the opportunity, under section 353, to petition the Court of Disputed Returns. They chose not to do that. They were not prepared to put their money on the table. They simply wanted to wait until the parliament resumed, so they could put the Senate's money on the table and force Senator&hyphen;elect Ferris to go off and defend herself in the High Court, which is not a cheap thing to do unless you throw yourself on the mercy of the court and go there unrepresented. That is what they are doing. They are transferring the cost burden. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1216">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More importantly, the whole structure of the act is that, if you are only a senator&hyphen;elect, you petition. If it is in respect of either a senator, under 376, or a question concerning a vacancy, then the Senate may resolve it. It does not have to; it always retains a discretion. I would have thought what is does above all else is to look at the evidence and decide whether indeed there is a prima&hyphen;facie case. You do not simply say, `There may be an issue here,' or `Perhaps there is a doubt,' or `Wouldn't it be interesting to have this resolved?' That is why I presume you use the expression `we tend to agree.' In other words, you are inclined to think that there may be something to this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suggest to you that it is a very unsafe basis on which to then solemnly resolve to refer a matter to the High Court. What the act requires, in these circumstances where you are out of time and have not petitioned within 40 days, is that you then must wait until the senator takes, in this case, her place in the chamber. Then section 376 applies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is likely to happen here, and I suggest will happen, is that when this matter goes to the High Court, they will ask themselves, `Are we now dealing with any question respecting the qualifications of a senator?' The answer has to be no, because by no stretch of the imagination was Jeannie Ferris a senator at the time these matters arose. As we know, by definition, there can only be 76 senators in the Senate chamber. Therefore, she could not possibly be a senator at that time, because she would be the 77th. Indeed, you could throw in all the other senators&hyphen;elect as well. She clearly was not a senator, so the High Court would say, `Well, the other leg of section 376 is: `respecting a vacancy.' It does not say `a potential vacancy'; it says `a vacancy.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One can envisage a situation where, for example, a senator&hyphen;elect dies.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That happened in 1938, with a gentleman by the name of Barnes. That matter was then referred back to the relevant state government and they replaced Barnes because a vacancy had occurred. It was not done under this section. There was not any resolution of the Senate requesting the state government to do it. That is the only situation in which you could say a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> vacancy occurs. Here, you have the prospect of a vacancy if the court finds in your way. What you are really saying is: we want you to presume an offence and therefore a vacancy. Then, having done that, we want to argue the case about whether there is a vacancy. It just cannot be right in logic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proper course to take is to wait until 1 July. Then you may well take the view that a question respecting the qualifications of a senator does arise because, as I think is common ground, if you are found to have taken an office of profit under the crown then that renders your term void. So it is void ab initio; it goes back to the very start. That was what Senator Wood found. Even though he had been in the chamber for 18 months or two years, once he was ineligible he was ineligible from the beginning. The same would apply here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, to the extent that Senator-elect Ferris had contravened, say, section 44 of the constitution, which is what I think is at issue, rather than any sections of the acts, that would render her ineligible to retain her seat and she would be held not to have been a senator at any time. But the time to make that reference is at the time she is a senator; otherwise there is no section of this act that allows the Senate to refer the matter to the High Court, because there is not a vacancy and it is not a question respecting the qualifications of a senator&mdash;it is simply respecting a potential vacancy, and that potential turns on the reference of the question.

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, that is the whole point. You might say that that is logical, but it is not if you look at the section of the act. The senator-elect situation is covered by the prospect of the petition. There is a window; you have the 40 days. But the view that is clearly taken by the parliament is that there is no great harm done by allowing that person, once you are outside the 40-day period, to then enter the parliament. Then the issue arises and then it can be dealt with under <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1217"> section 376; otherwise the parliament would simply have provided for that. You always have to proceed on the basis that if parliament does not specifically provide for an offence or quasi-offence then it is presumed to have intended not to do it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, when it says that you can petition in respect of an election, that is clearly what it intended to do in respect of a senator-elect. But you have a time limit on it. If you do not do that then you are left to take advantage of section 376&mdash;again, when the opportunity arises, and it does not arise until 1 July.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no harm done in those circumstances. Quite clearly, if an issue is then referred to the Court of Disputed Returns, there needs to be sufficient material to justify it. I would still argue that you need to have established a prima facie case and not just something about which some people are concerned. Undoubtedly Senator Bolkus is concerned to unload as many of his political opponents, both on this side and on that side, as possible. But that is not a sufficient basis for taking what is a very serious course of conduct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why I am surprised, to say the least, that the Australian Democrats and perhaps the Greens somehow think this is going to clarify the issue or that it helps to have it resolved. Senator Kernot's private member's bill in effect said, `This arises time and again. It's about time the parliament did something. There have been innumerable inquiries. They all come up with the same answer. The proper way therefore to resolve it is by way of this bill,' which she introduced into the parliament and which was not able to be dealt with before the parliament was prorogued in early 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have thought that is what those who are interested in the principle of the issue would be concerned to do. I thought they would want to tidy this up; but not rush off helter-skelter, irrespective of the law, desperate to get the thing before the High Court. If my argument is right, the High Court will say, `We don't have jurisdiction because you brought this matter to our attention at the wrong time.' If you want to adjourn the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> matter until 1 July, you will be on much stronger ground.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Obviously Senator Bolkus is. Under the protection of the parliament he is prepared to slander someone by talking about aiding, abetting, counselling and procuring and knowingly concerned. There is not a skerrick of evidence to suggest that. As I say, all the logic is to the contrary and he basically has to throw in the towel because even the Greens and the Democrats will not support him. But he has no compunction about trotting it out in this parliament, knowing it can be reported throughout the breadth of the land. That is the sort of concern that Senator Bolkus has for people's reputations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think others in this chamber are quite as cavalier about the matter. Therefore you ought to be bending over backwards to ensure that, if you are going down this path, you do it from the strongest possible base. If you refer this to the High Court now, you run a very real risk that the High Court will say, `This is not to do with the question respecting the qualifications of a senator; it is a senator&hyphen;elect that you are concerned about. It is not respecting a vacancy because there was no <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1218"> vacancy at the time of the matters in question or indeed at the time of the reference.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, by wanting to rush off irrespective of this, you are giving yourself a very good chance of losing the preliminary point. The High Court will not even proceed to entertain it because you have not met the threshold qualifications. In those circumstances, I do not understand why you do not simply wait until 1 July. You would have a much stronger case. You would then be dealing with a question respecting the qualifications of a senator. She would be sitting in the chamber; she would be a senator. You could say that there is an issue about her qualifications and, in your view, it would be game, set and match. But, on the current view, I would have thought that you are taking a very real risk. The fact that you are prepared to take that risk speaks volumes for your bona fides in this issue. It means that you are not concerned about the proper processes. You simply want to maximise the political advantage that you think derives from trying to capitalise on any embarrassment that might flow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You and I know that the end result will be that this is entirely fruitless and futile. You will not have achieved anything to advantage your side of politics. You might have put the taxpayers and the Senate through a fair degree of pain and discomfort and you may have put Senate-elect Ferris through considerable financial discomfort, but you will not have altered the balance in this chamber by one iota.</PARA>

We don't want any clouds hanging over people's heads,' you would wait until 1 July, when you would have a much stronger case to argue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hesitate to concede `case' because, as I keep saying to you, there is still an exercise of discretion and you should not do this unless there is a strong prima facie case. Putting that to one side, you would be on immeasurably stronger ground if you were dealing with the qualifications of a senator <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and not a senator-elect and if you did not need to deal with the issue of vacancy. That would not be necessary for your purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are determined to proceed today, you will simply be demonstrating that all you are on about is maximising political advantage for yourselves and perceived inconvenience to the other side.

Yet you seem blindly determined to press on immediately.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Alston did not move anything. He should get his act together. I believe the substantive motion should have been moved by the government and not by the opposition.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to correct one erroneous point appearing in some newspapers that this matter could affect the balance in the Senate post-1 July. If for some reason Senate-elect Ferris cannot take her place by then, there is no way that this side would take advantage of that in a numerical sense, and we would automatically grant a pair.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said before, it is probably of little consequence to those on this side of the house whether Senator Ferris is here or the No. 4 on the ticket arrives. There will be the same numbers. It would make no difference. I understand they are of relatively similar ability, if not different factional alignment. Again, I really cannot be bothered trying to track that through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real key question that Senator Alston failed to address is: what happens to the validity of legislation here if Senator Ferris is not properly a senator? In the case of Wood and the case of Webster, the matters were acted upon when they came up. If this is not acted upon here and we knew with knowledge aforethought that there were grave doubts about Senator-elect Ferris's eligibility to serve in this place, we do not know what would then happen in the High Court as to eligibility. In the Cleary case, once he was challenged and knocked out, it did not invalidate any legislation because the moment the petition was taken and acted upon was regarded as the cut&hyphen;off point. It would not be in this case.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are really three or four key questions in this case. The first one is: was Ms Ferris ever employed? Later I will go through the chronology to suggest very strong evidence that she was employed. It is the contention of Senator Minchin and others that she was never actually employed. That is a matter that I cannot determine absolutely, although I would say the evidence strongly points to the fact that she was. The second question to be answered is: was this an office of profit under the Crown under the meaning of section 44 of the constitution? The third question is: if that is correct, if Ms Ferris had accepted an office of profit under the Crown, does this disqualify her from the Senate? That is a question that has never been fully answered by the High Court or anyone else and would be the question they would answer in this case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last question which is necessary to answer is: if she proves to be ineligible, would there be a count through, as occurred in the Wood case&mdash;there was a count through that brought up Senator Irina Dunn&mdash;or is it a section 15? It would be very interesting if it is a section 15. This may all become a pointless exercise, because I am sure the South Australian branch would then reappoint Senator Ferris to the post. I am fairly certain that would be the normal political behaviour of any of us. There is some doubt as to that in as much as in the case where someone dies between the close of nominations and, I think, taking their place here, the electoral act and other things indicate that there would need to be a count through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those are questions the High Court would need to answer. I found it very interesting tonight that Senator Alston did not get to factors other than the legal factor. He tried to mount no defence of government action in this particular matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The matter was first raised on the first sitting day. We were accused of filibustering on this issue. It was not us who took 19 days to answer a very simple question: had the Attorney-General's Department given the Department of Administrative Services advice on this matter? The answer, obviously, from all the documents in the return to order, is that they could have come back the next day <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1220"> and said, `Yes, but we're not going to provide any of the legal advice.' I think it is quite appropriate not to put down every piece of legal advice to government. But they could have answered it on 2 May. Instead, we had no answer for nine days, which prompted someone on our side to ask Senator Short a question and Senator Short took it on notice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you read the return to order, there is all of this advice, all of these documents generated, these meetings&mdash;all of this occurred, yet Senator Short could not answer these very simple questions. Surely, he had a brief, going through all of that. Was it just stage fright? Did he just panic? Why didn't he answer those questions? And why did Senator Vanstone, on 20 May or thereabouts, answer on behalf of Senator Short those particular questions?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That prompted our side of politics to move for a return to order. It is from that return to order and many other things on the record that one can start to understand the chronology of events. I will just run through them rather quickly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 18 March, Senator Minchin writes, to whom it may concern, confirming his wish to appoint Senator Ferris to the position of assistant adviser from 18 March until 28 June inclusive. He confirms the salary details of an ASO6, with a salary of $40,080 per year and a ministerial staff allowance of $11,200&mdash;very interesting pay for a volunteer. He then signs a work contract on the same day. Ms Ferris signs a work contract; Ms Dunstan witnesses that contract.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 18 March, Senator Minchin writes to Ms Feely of the Prime Minister's office, advising of wanting to appoint Ms Ferris. On 20 March, Ms Ferris starts travelling on the travel warrants according to her job. And where does she go? Adelaide&hyphen;Canberra, Qantas 474, first class, costing $499. She returns, Canberra&hyphen;Adelaide, on 21 March on Ansett 185. On 25 March, Senator Minchin writes to Minister Jull advising he has&mdash;and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . appointed Ms Jeannie Ferris to the position of Assistant Adviser to me in my capacity as Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to note the appointment period of 18 March to 28 June. He also notes in the letter that Ms Ferris is a senator&hyphen;elect due to take up her position on 1 July.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We then go to 28 March. The DAS pay sheet for Ms Ferris, for pay period 19, indicates that Ms Ferris is paid three days salary and three days MSA, which is a gross of $604. After tax, there is a net of $512.64. We then go to pay period 20, where Ms Ferris is paid 10 days salary and 10 days MSA, with a gross of $2,015.16; tax comes out and she nets $1,391.86.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 28 March, the Department of Administrative Services faxes a cover sheet referring to the Ferris request to recommence contributions to the Commonwealth superannuation scheme. Here we have a volunteer joining the Commonwealth superannuation scheme! No one knows more about this than Senator Sherry and our very gracious Acting Deputy President. They would be very surprised to know that volunteers can go into the superannuation scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We then have a whole series of travel around the country, for which travel warrants were obviously signed off by Senator Minchin or one of his delegated staff members, in which Ms Ferris attends to the duties of her office. We then have the rather curious correspondence on 1 April 1996. I am conscious of the date but apparently it is actual correspondence. Ms Ferris having been in the job for 13 or 14 days, Senator Minchin writes to Ann Richards of the Department of Administrative Services, referring to his prior correspondence between himself and DAS and noting that he could appoint an adviser on a commencement salary of $49,932. He advises that he wishes Ms Ferris to go on that. Pretty good work, after 13 days, to get a 22 per cent pay rise! It is good money if you can get it. Again, a volunteer getting a 22 per cent pay rise is pretty good. We then have a whole series of travel commitments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, someone in the Department of Administrative Services does some good staff work. Right throughout this, I have very little criticism of Mr Jull and the Department of Administrative Services because I think they have done their job pretty well. They twigged <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1221"> to this&mdash;that this was a problem, that this may well disqualify Ms Ferris. So Graham Semmens' file note indicates he will advise Mr Jull in a submission regarding these matters. That submission goes in on 2 April. Ms Ferris is still flying around the country doing her duty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Jull, the Minister for Administrative Services, signs a letter, above the submission, to Senator Minchin, advising that he does not intend to approve Ms Ferris's appointment at this stage. He attaches a copy, very significantly, of Senator Durack's opinion on the meaning of section 44 as it applies to senators&hyphen;elect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At that stage Ms Richards, whom I have mentioned before, urgently faxes the National Australia Bank, confirming a phone call that day to retrieve the second tranche of salary, and gets that returned. Ms Ferris does not know about that yet. The matters go on until 11 April, when there is a meeting here in Parliament House. I put on the record that I misrepresented this the other day and Senator Minchin berated me for it. I have to say the documents in the return to order are handwritten and very hard to read. Nevertheless, I acknowledge it was not on Easter Monday, but on 11 April. For that, I apologise. Nevertheless, a government which put out those documents should have gone back to the original person and got a typed version rather than a handwritten one. However, I regret that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They met here in Parliament House&mdash;that is, Ms Ferris, Graham Semmens and Senator Minchin. They discussed the fact that the payment of three days salary to Ms Ferris may have jeopardised her position as a senator&hyphen;elect. They advised that DAS had discussed the matter with the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department and stated that DAS had not paid the next salary payment due to Ms Ferris, and explained why. In fact, they had paid it but they then retrieved it from the bank.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The file note noted that this was okay with Ms Ferris and pointed out that the constitutional position was not one for DAS but rather for them. And then Ms Ferris travels home, which I think is the last time she uses <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> departmental resources to travel or salary or travel allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is only on 19 April&mdash;eight days later&mdash;that Ms Ferris writes to DAS returning the money and advising that she will not take up the appointment. It is only 19 April that Senator Minchin writes to DAS cancelling the appointment. So, effectively, from 18 March to 19 April, Ms Ferris was holding an office and an office of profit under the crown, if it is so defined under the MOPS act, and in fact received remuneration, travel allowance, airfares&mdash;and cab fares, as we found out today in those circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is basically the chronology of it and therefore there is a very strong case that Ms Ferris was employed. I do not think that that can be contradicted very much. And I think there is a very strong case that because she was employed by a member of the Executive Council she held an office of profit under the crown.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The one thing I am not going to comment on is whether the High Court would therefore say that she has forfeited her position as a senator&hyphen;elect. That is for them to determine; I cannot. It has been the general view, expressed not only in the Durack thing but time and time again, that senators&hyphen;elect cannot take government employment. For those elected in 1980 there was an eight&hyphen;month wait for those who were, in some senses, public servants. A lot of hard times; a lot of people stood out.</PARA>

So that is the chronology.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1222">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the course of this debate, a few other remarkable things have come up. First of all, I listened to Senator Hill's defence of Ms Ferris, who described this as a witch&hyphen;hunt. It is no such thing. Senator Hill's contribution today reminded me of the old maxim by Lenin; he gave her the same support as the rope supports the hanging man. I really thought it was a weak defence. I was rather pleased in some way that the old journeyman middleweight, Senator Alston, the star of Melbourne's lesser magistrates courts, only really went to the legal matters and did not go to any of the matters of cover&hyphen;up&mdash;and there have been plenty of those in this particular matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The one area that has not been fully explained to me regarding cover&hyphen;up or veracity goes back to Senator Minchin's statement to this chamber on 22 May. I am really puzzled by this. Senator Minchin said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following the federal election, Ms Ferris, on my advice, sought information regarding the status of a senator&hyphen;elect in relation to section 44 of the constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While it is my strong view that section 44 does not apply to senators&hyphen;elect, I felt it prudent that Ms Ferris obtain her own legal advice before considering any public sector employment in the period after the election and before 1 July.</PARA>
<PARA>Well, where is that advice? When did it occur? Or was this just a post facta defence of Senator Minchin that he, as a political professional, was smart enough to think of? Or is the advice that he is talking about the advice that was tabled here today? That is a critical question as to Senator Minchin's future&mdash;absolutely critical that he did not mislead the Senate on these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legal advice, which has been tabled by Senator Hill today and which naturally none of us has had a chance yet to read and comprehend, is dated 17 May. If there is not another set of legal advice, if this is the legal advice on which they based their activity, then Senator Minchin's statement here in the parliament on 22 May could be described at the very least as grossly dissembling. He was invited to clarify this matter by me in two speeches that day and never once addressed it. It does go massively to his credibility in these particular issues.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A few other matters have been brought up here today. One of them was Senator Hill asking how we could, in some ways abusing taxpayers' money, refer this matter to the High Court. So I went back as he was speaking to check where he was on the day that we had the debate on the Wood case. I found that he was in divisions that day, so he must have been around Parliament House. No division was called on the Wood matter; it was referred off without a division. Implicit in that is Senator Hill's full support for that process back in 1989. And he comes in here today and says that we are in some ways abusing Senate power or wasting taxpayers' money when there we had Senator Hill himself implicitly voting to send these matters off to the High Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Hill said that had read the advice of the Clerk of the Senate and he did not agree with it. Why not? That is only one set of advice; we now have a second set of advice before us from Ms Wheeler QC and we have the Durack advice. The point I want to make is that it is beyond my ability to reconcile that conflicting advice, and I want to suggest that that is why we pay High Court judges. That is why the Electoral Act and other matters are written in the manner they are: to let judges ultimately determine these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, these matters could have been addressed much more quickly by government. There is no excuse for a 19&hyphen;day delay in Senator Vanstone's answer. There is no excuse that, in answering for Senator Short, all the detail was omitted from Senator Short's answer. We asked whether she had had any pay or condition. No answer. When the additional answer was put down in this place on 20 May, or whenever it was, there was no attempt to answer that section of the question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we had Senator Minchin coming in here to give his personal explanation, which must be one of the most cleverly crafted pieces of work I have ever seen. I have already mentioned that he referred to legal advice&mdash;presumably the Wheeler advice which was not commissioned until 17 May&mdash;as though it had been produced before 18 March. If I am wrong in saying that, where is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1223"> the advice? I do not want to read the advice because it may be private to Ms Ferris and Senator Minchin, but I want to know that it existed and that we were not being duped in this place just to maintain the political professional reputation of an apparatchik from South Australia. People know that I do not use that term in a condemnatory way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to know whether that has all been constructed in this statement. Because, frankly, if it has been, given the Prime Minister's glorified code of conduct, Senator Minchin should be dismissed as parliamentary secretary on that ground alone. Whether he should be dismissed for political stupidity, as Senator Schacht has unkindly said, is another matter. I find it hard to understand how a so-called consummate political operator could make these basic mistakes and jeopardise Ms Ferris's immediate career in this chamber. I cannot understand how he could do it. Senator Hill is wrong when he says that we are trying to run some vendetta against Ms Ferris. There is no evidence whatsoever to point to our doing that.</PARA>

I do not wish to not see her take her place in the Senate; she won the vote. But, if she is disqualified by Senator Minchin's abject stupidity, I think a question can be raised as to his future. So there are two questions. As to the one of stupidity, we have all been guilty of that over the years. The second question is whether he has grossly misled the Senate in his dissembling statement issued in here on 22 May. As to that, we need more of an explanation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Alston made the point that, in his own legal analysis, he thought this motion was being moved at the wrong time. He would much prefer it to be moved when there are 37 coalition senators here and the numbers change a little. When challenged by me by way of interjection whether he would vote for the reference in August, we got the normal barrister's reply: `I can't confirm or deny <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that.' All he is doing by those arguments is putting it off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said here once before, in one sense and one sense alone it is very much in Ms Ferris's self&hyphen;interest to have these matters determined as close to the swearing&hyphen;in date as possible. Even when she is sworn in and takes her place in here, I understand that the matter can still be taken to the High Court. The penalty which could apply and which I think was updated in the Webster case would be $200 a day. That will be a much more expensive proposition than doing it in this particular way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, I believe the first three parts of this motion should go to the High Court for determination. It is not for this chamber to determine this matter. There are too many political biases and there is not the expertise here to deal with it. It should go to the High Court for determination, and hopefully we will have a determination well before 1 July. Those efforts by the government to cover up this matter have been exposed by the return to order, and Senator Minchin's dissembling statement in this chamber has now been exposed. He should come in here today to explain the sequence of events and his actions, but he has been absent. Rather than directly reflect on&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is dealing with quite a serious matter relating to the constitution and one which obviously should be treated as such.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It may well be, but you need to look at that. I will not delay the Senate very long. I was here during the Robert Wood case and also the Webster episode.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are four, actually, but there are three ways that are open to question the qualifications of a senator. Before I do that, I remind the Senate of section 44, which I will go to in a minute. But the three ways are: section 355 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act which provides for a petition. That has been canvassed quite considerably here and 355 says:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subject to section 357, every petition disputing an election or return&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>an election or return&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in this Part called the petition shall:</PARA>
<PARA>And it sets out what it shall do. The petition must be lodged within 40 days after the notification of that choice or appointment. Referring to section 44 of the constitution and referring to the question of holding an office of profit under the crown, it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any person who&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Holds any office of profit under the Crown&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>et cetera&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">shall be incapable of being chosen or of sitting as a senator or a member of the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, section 355 of the act relates to the question of the choice of the senator. It does not relate to the question of whether the senator is eligible to sit. The constitution has an `or' there:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">shall be incapable of being chosen or of sitting as a senator or a member of the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA>One would have thought that if one were incapable of being chosen to be a senator, one would have been incapable of sitting as a senator. No doubt that is a matter that would otherwise be discussed. But, so far as section 355 is concerned, the opportunity for petitioning the court has ceased; it is no longer there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think Senator Bolkus was suggesting that the date on which the Governor&hyphen;General received the writs was 21 April. If you were taking it from that particular standpoint, a couple of days are still left. But, in fact, it was the state governor of South Australia who issued the writ and the provision in the constitution relating to the return of that writ, of course, relates to its return to the state government, namely, return to the sender. The actual timing of when the state governor received the return of the writ was 11 April. So that, in fact, the time has run out for section 355 to operate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second availability is the provisions in section 376. I am not going into the question of the facts. The facts have been tabled in this Senate and there has been and will be considerable argument about the implications of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1225"> those particular facts. Section 376 provides that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any question respecting the qualifications of a Senator or of a Member of the House of Representatives or respecting a vacancy in either House of the Parliament may be referred by resolution to the Court of Disputed Returns&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>That is what is proposed here. There are a number of questions but two come to mind: whether the alleged breach of the constitution that Ms Ferris did hold an office of profit under the crown whilst seeking to be chosen as a senator, is a matter that the Court of Disputed Returns could deal with. Does the constitution, by the wording of section 44, mean a person who may at that time have held an office of profit under the crown&mdash;that is, during the time of the election and before the return of the writs&mdash;so that her incapability of being chosen would be a matter for consideration of the court pursuant to this particular resolution?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a question the answer to which I am not sure of, given the fact that section 355 was quite specific about the time limits and that those time limits, of course, have gone. The courts may not be able to consider that matter. There is a question as to whether Senator-elect Ferris, Ms Ferris, was holding an office of profit under the crown after she was chosen&mdash;that is to say, after the writs were returned to the Governor of South Australia. I am not sure of those facts, and I do not know whether anybody around here is either. But I think the opposition should be conscious of that particular matter. The opposition may be referring this to the Court of Disputed Returns and find, if the other question is unable to be considered&mdash;that is to say, the eligibility of that particular person to be chosen during the course of the election&mdash;that that is excluded and we are back to square one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second part of the argument, of course, is in the constitution where it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . shall be incapable of being chosen or of sitting as a senator or a member of the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, Ms Ferris currently is not the holder of an office of profit under the crown. Also, she is not&mdash;or is she?&mdash;currently a sitting <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> member. So is she incapable of sitting as a member? The issue really is whether a senator is a sitting senator before that senator has sat. I think that is an issue to be taken into account when considering this particular motion.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third issue is the provision of section 46 of the constitution. That section enables any individual to sue for the recovery of $200 per day for every day that a senator has sat when that senator is incapable of sitting, under the constitution. Of course, I suppose that is a matter for consideration of the parliament, of us here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One thing worries me about what we are doing at the present moment. There was a bit of cross&hyphen;talk between Senator Abetz and Senator Ray. As Senator Ray was not talking at the time, it will not be in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, but that bit of cross&hyphen;talk engendered the thought in my mind that one should raise the question as to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1226"> whether the costs of Ms Ferris in defending herself should properly be borne by the parliament, if we are to send the matter to court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that I am concerned that a number of matters have been raised politically in this chamber about Ms Ferris. I do not know Ms Ferris from a bar of soap, nor do many other people. But certain matters were raised in this chamber, and I thought that they were improperly raised in this chamber or that they were raised in an improper manner, and certain inferences were made when Ms Ferris was not here to defend herself. That is another question. However, parts (d) (e) and (f) are out of this particular motion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must raise the question with the opposition as to whether they intend to include in this motion a provision that the costs of her defending herself would be borne by the Commonwealth, either by this parliament or by the executive government. I tried to find out what was the case in Robert Woods's case and I am not able to ascertain whether he in fact had his costs covered.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in this debate to support the motion moved by Senator Bolkus. He has already indicated, as we have, that we are aware of the amendment from the Greens and the Democrats to excise paragraphs (d), (e) and (f). I think Senator Bolkus recognised that the numbers are probably there for that to occur, but that is not the substantive issue that we have before us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just want to make a couple of comments on the contributions made by some of the previous speakers in this debate. I turn to Senator Alston's remarks that you cannot take action until Senator Ferris is sworn in as a sitting senator. I wanted to refer to section 360 of the electoral act, which deals with the powers of the court, that is, the High Court operating as the Court of Disputed Returns. Section 360, clause (3), says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Without limiting the powers conferred by this section, it is hereby declared that the power of the Court to declare that any person who was returned as elected was not duly elected, or to declare an election absolutely void, may be exercised on the ground that illegal practices were committed in connexion with the election.</PARA>
<PARA>What clause (3) implies to me is that this takes effect once the person was declared elected, before they even took up their seat in the Senate. I was at the ceremony where Senator Ferris was declared elected because I was also declared elected at the same time in early April. The writ was returned to the state governor on 10 April, declaring Senator <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1227"> Ferris elected with the other six senators from South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that is a reasonably clear indication that the Court of Disputed Returns, which is the High Court in this case, can deal with somebody who has been declared elected. It does not have to wait until they are actually sworn in, which happens some time after the return of the writ. I think the High Court does have the power. I have to concede that there are older hands around this place on legal matters with due experience who might say that that is not the right interpretation, but it does seem to me an indication that on the date you are declared elected this takes effect. I say again that I was a witness to her election being declared because I was at the ceremony when it happened, where I was also declared elected. So I think that point from Senator Alston can be dismissed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue that Senator Harradine raises with some concern is that the 40 days has run out as far as a petition to the Court of Disputed Returns is concerned. As I understand the act, that is to do with the actual conduct of the election, not with the eligibility of a person to stand. This is an area where I think the major point of dispute is, and I believe the High Court is the only relevant body to rule on that eligibility question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I point out to Senator Harradine that the opposition has been a bit hung out to dry on this issue of the 40 days anyway. In order to seek information, we raised the issue on the first day the parliament returned&mdash;that was on 30 April, if I remember correctly. It was not until 22 May, when Senator Minchin made a substantial statement, that a whole range of issues then became clearer to the opposition, the Senate and the people of Australia. Clearly, Senator-elect Ferris had been receiving some payment, in some form or other, from the Commonwealth government of Australia. Senator Minchin said that she had received three days pay and some expenses for travel to other parts. Subsequently, when we got the return to order, we found it was much more substantial than anything Senator Minchin had suggested in his statement on 22 May.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to Senator Harradine: 22 May just so happens to be 40 days after the writ was <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> returned by the state government. It seems to us that there was a government plan for Senator Minchin not to make his statement until the 40 days was up so that this technical point&mdash;that the petition could not be lodged&mdash;could be raised. We do not accept that point, because it is a question of eligibility, not a question of the conduct of the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition thinks it is more than coincidence that Senator Minchin gave his major statement on the issue on 22 May&mdash;three weeks after we first raised the issue in the parliament. I say to Senator Harradine: you cannot, in commonsense, allow a process to take place whereby, when relevant questions are asked about what is going on, when a matter has been legitimately raised and when we as a Senate are waiting for the information to come back, someone can delay the process hoping that the 40 days falls out. I would have thought any court, under process, under administrative law, would have said that the question was first raised, information was sought, on 30 April. Of course, it was after Senator Minchin's statement that the Senate decided to put a return to order on papers and documents. The whole case spilled out when those documents were tabled earlier this week. Even today we had further material tabled by Senator Hill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think Senator Minchin has a case to answer about why he waited to make his statement until he could see the 40&hyphen;day period was up. That is a very important point to us. Did the government take a deliberate decision to wait till the 40 days was up and then argue the case? Senator Harradine has raised that. I think we have said why we think the timing of the government's statements is unacceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Minchin relies greatly on the statement of advice from Ms Wheeler. He said that Senator-elect Ferris was advised to go and get this opinion, or get some legal opinion, before she took up employment with Senator Minchin. The implication so far has been that that advice was from Ms Wheeler QC. However, the date on the document of advice that has now been tabled is 17 May, which is about a month after Senator-elect Ferris started employment on the staff of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1228"> Senator Minchin, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister. I think the first letter in which Senator Minchin says he appointed Ms Ferris is dated 18 March.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There may be other legal advice that has not yet been tabled, but we are now of the view that there is a substantial case that the advice he said he got was actually the advice of Ms Wheeler on 17 May. If that is really the case, then Senator Minchin has, by at least omission&mdash;the best light you could put on it&mdash;misled the Senate. At the worst, he has deliberately misled the Senate by saying that this advice from Wheeler is the advice that Senator-elect Ferris took on board to enable her to take up the position with him on 18 March. If it is not, I think it is imperative that before this parliament finishes this week&mdash;preferably tomorrow or even before this debate finishes&mdash;Senator Minchin should tell us whether Wheeler's advice is the only advice that Senator-elect Ferris took. Then he has to explain how the advice tabled in parliament today is dated 17 May&mdash;a full month after Senator-elect Ferris took up her position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next question we would ask is: who paid for Ms Wheeler's advice? Was it paid for by Senator-elect Ferris? Was it paid for by the Liberal Party of South Australia? Was it paid for by the Australian government? These are relevant questions which, I suspect, in the end, if this motion does lead to the matter going to the High Court, will become matters that the High Court will become interested in. The Senate deserves a decent answer to those questions. Who paid for the advice? Who commissioned the advice? The dates are really imperative. If there is any other advice that Ms Ferris took on before 18 March, she should fire up Senator Minchin or the government to table that advice as well. Otherwise, it seems to us that there has been a clear case of rewriting history, rewriting the facts, to suit the government's case. The government has been sprung since 30 April when the parliament first sat. That case is now to us looking overwhelming.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been retrospectivity in this case. I am interested in the Liberal Party's position on retrospectivity in any area because the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> issue of retrospectivity has always been&mdash;and you, Mr Deputy President Watson, have been one of the great commentators in this place, opposing retrospectivity in law and in legislation&mdash;one of the great policy principles of the Liberal Party. I do not have the same view about retrospectivity from time to time, but I do accept that it is a matter you do not take on lightly. Here we may have a case where Senator Minchin has retrospectively tried to fix the advice to cover his trail in making a very stupid error in appointing&mdash;as all the evidence now tabled in the parliament shows&mdash;Senator-elect Ferris on 18 March.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Minchin says the appointment took place on 18 March; that is, before the writ was declared, before she formally became senator&hyphen;elect. One notes from the appointment document, though, that he appointed her only to 28 June, two days before the term of the new Senate starts. Everybody in South Australia knew on election night on 2 March&mdash;it was the clearest cut election in the Senate in South Australia since proportional representation was introduced&mdash;that the Liberal Party had three quotas, the Labor Party had two quotas and the Democrats had one quota. Everybody knew who were the six senators who were going to be elected in South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was no distribution of preferences at any stage in the South Australian count to get a senator elected. The only distribution was the transfer that took place on the tickets of each of the three parties. There was a very small transfer from Senator Stott Despoja. She got 14 per cent, with a little left over. The Labor Party, unfortunately, got only two quotas with a little left over&mdash;a couple of per cent&mdash;and the Liberal Party got three clear quotas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Everybody knew, including Senator Minchin as a former State Director of the Liberal Party, that Senator Ferris was going to be elected to the Senate when the count was formally concluded. He cannot escape from that. It is why, in his letter of appointment on 18 March, even before the Senate count was formally completed, he appointed her only until 28 June. He knew that on 1 July she would become a senator in this place <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1229"> and that she would be paid from 1 July, even though she would have to wait until 20 August to be sworn in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let there not be any mystery position, `I didn't really know whether she was going to be elected.' I have never seen such a clear&hyphen;cut result in my 30 years in Labor Party politics as in this South Australian Senate election. The result&mdash;who the six senators were&mdash;was clearly established on election night. Senator Minchin knew that and that is reflected in his 18 March letter of appointment. He knew where she was going: into the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next thing we come to is the advice that has been flying around as to whether the senator&hyphen;elect is eligible to stand in the Senate and the impact her holding an office of profit under the crown would have. So far, we have different pieces of advice. We have the advice from Miss Wheeler on behalf of Senator&hyphen;elect Ferris and Senator Minchin, saying that there is no doubt that the senator&hyphen;elect is able and eligible to take her place. We have the advice of former Senator Durack, a former Attorney&hyphen;General. That has been tabled in this place. It is referred to in Mr Jull's letter warning Senator Minchin. He refers to the advice of Senator Durack&mdash;a Liberal Attorney&hyphen;General, a long&hyphen;serving and distinguished senator in this place. He said that office of profit under the crown means senator&hyphen;elect and that there is grave doubt about the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We find it interesting that a former Liberal Attorney&hyphen;General's advice is disputed by the Liberal Party in this place. Advice from the Clerk of the Senate, Mr Harry Evans, was made available yesterday.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me just say one thing, Senator Kemp, about this hounding. You ought to have a good look at a number of Liberal Party members in South Australia who have leaked consistently to the media. In an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Adelaide Advertiser</EMPHASIS>  of Saturday week ago John Ferguson, the parliamentary roundsman for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> , wrote an article headed `White ants are taking a piece of the action'. This is all about the Ferris case. In the article he makes quite clear that this article was sourced from people within the Liberal Party. He mentioned in this article:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite parliament yet to be told whether or not Ms Ferris's position is in any real danger, some Liberals already have started moving to install a member of the State Executive and a leading moderate, Ms Maria Kourtesis, to replace Ms Ferris.</PARA>
<PARA>He has said that came from the Liberal Party. The advice and some of the hints we have been getting and the view that this should be chased have come from Liberal Party members in South Australia. They have been salivating at this because Ms Ferris's preselection from the so-called conservative faction was a hotly disputed ballot in South Australia with Ms Kourtesis. Ms Ferris won it and Ms Kourtesis came fourth on the ticket.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt, as that article and our own experience show, that this is a matter of great controversy in the Liberal Party and there is a substantial section in the Liberal Party which wants Ms Ferris knocked off, to use that political term. That article says it all in great detail. A further part of the article states: </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Ferris issue flared on Monday might at the Liberal Party State Executive when former party president Ms Vickie Chapman openly disputed who should pay for any legal costs flowing from the issue. One line being pushed to undermine Ms Ferris is that the State branch faces a bill of $200,000 in legal costs because the matter "inevitably" will go to the High Court.</PARA>
<PARA>There was a report only a few days ago in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  on this issue where the journalist commented, without naming the minister, that a senior cabinet minister from South Australia and a recent cabinet minister bagged Ms Ferris. It did not name the person, so you can say it is unsourced and has no substantiation. So Senator Kemp, to say that we have hounded Ms Ferris is absolutely outrageous.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter that is before the Senate is one of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a serious nature. I join with Senator Harradine, who, I think, was trying to lift the level of debate to the actual questions in issue rather than descending into the political mud&hyphen;slinging that unfortunately occurred from members on the other side. Clearly, what we are talking about is the future of a woman who put her herself up for election, submitted herself to the people and was overwhelmingly elected. Now there is an argument being put forward, which I will go through in detail, suggesting that she is not entitled to take her seat in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> This is a serious matter and I do not think it reflects well on this chamber, or on those who have partaken in the debate to date and have tried to limit the scope of the debate to some fairly cheap political points.

I am pleased to see that the Labor Party are now no longer to going to pursue, in effect, half of their motion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Senator Bolkus claims credit for this motion, and that is fine. But as Senator Harradine has pointed out, if there is going to be the deletion of subparagraphs (d), (e) and (f), then clearly the motion will need further amendment in relation to the words `one or more senators'. Also of interest to me is the contribution made by Senator Ray, who was so anxious to point out that we were talking not about a senator-elect but a senator-designate. If you have a look at subparagraph (a) of the motion, Senator Bolkus refers to the person that we are talking about as a senator-elect, not as a senator-designate. It is up to the Labor Party, who are pursuing this line, to get their terminology right and decide exactly what it is and what it ought be.</PARA>

I would have thought that if you are dealing with these sorts of technical matters you would try to get it as right as possible. I do not think it makes much difference. It was Senator Ray, in his contribution, who was wanting to correct our side of the chamber, telling us that it was a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1232"> senator-designate and not a senator-elect. Yet the very motion that he was talking to was referring to a `senator-elect'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> As I pointed out at the beginning, we have a situation where we are dealing with somebody's future. I believe that natural justice ought to come into play. Senator Schacht was very big on that in his discussion, and said that natural justice demands that the matter be dealt with. He is saying that natural justice demands that the matter be dealt with in this chamber in the absence of Senator-elect Ferris without giving her the opportunity to put her case to the Senate as to the circumstances surrounding the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, Senator Schacht tried to make a big point out of whether or not we could believe Senator Minchin's submission to this Senate on, I believe, 22 May 1996, about the legal advice that Senator-elect Ferris had got on the issue. Surely the only person who can answer that is Senator-elect Ferris. Senator Minchin will be going only on hearsay of what Senator-elect Ferris tells him. He does not know what Senator-elect Ferris did. She does. We are talking about principles of natural justice but we are denying the person who is at the very centre of this discussion the right to make a contribution to this Senate's deliberations on the matter. That is regrettable and unfortunate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was somewhat strange to hear the comments of Senator Schacht, who was talking about such high principles as natural justice and yet was very quick to slip into some unnecessary political commentary that was irrelevant to the issue at stake. I have a copy of the clerk's opinion, dated 27 May 1996, in front of me. Nowhere does it say that there is an overwhelming case, as suggested by Senator Schacht. If he was dealing with the issue with the mature, statesman-like approach that he tried to assert he was using&mdash;before he could not help himself and he slipped back into the mud-slinging&mdash;he would have quoted the clerk's advice correctly. He would have directed us to the pages and the paragraphs. The clerk has given an opinion, but nowhere has he used the word `overwhelming'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> It was Senator Schacht who was suggesting to us that Senator Minchin misled the Senate <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> about the existence of certain legal advice. I suggest there is no doubt whatsoever that Senator Schacht misled the Senate about this document which I hold, the opinion of the clerk, which clearly does not say that any of the propositions being asserted by Senator Schacht were supported on an overwhelming basis.</PARA>

If he could have got away with it, he would have done. Between the interjections, I did not pick up that Senator Schacht had corrected himself. But if Senator Schacht did correct himself it was, in my respectful submission to the Senate, a situation where he did try it, he got caught out and he then quickly corrected himself.

But it does not in any way deal with the issue of why he used the word `overwhelming' when it does not exist in any shape or form in the opinion from which he was seeking to quote.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Section 44 of the constitution deals with two types of people: those capable of being chosen and those who are sitting. They are <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1233"> the two categories of people. In this case, section 44 of the constitution says, `Any person who holds any office of profit under the Crown shall be incapable of being chosen or of sitting as a senator.' That is the relevant piece in our discussion this afternoon and this evening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator-elect Ferris has clearly been chosen. There was no suggestion that she was disqualified from being chosen. Nobody on the other side of the chamber has asserted that. As Senator Harradine pointed out, if there were to be some dispute about her entitlement to be so chosen, there are procedures under the Commonwealth Electoral Act that can be pursued. If those avenues were not pursued, then that area is closed off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we then have to consider whether or not Senator-elect Ferris is a sitting senator. Clearly she is not a sitting senator. I put this scenario to you, Mr Acting Deputy President: it is not beyond the realm of possibility that six senators are not re-elected at a half Senate election and another six are. So there would be six sitting senators waiting for 30 June and another six who are senators-elect waiting for 30 June so as to take up their seats. In that circumstance, the opposition is trying to assert that there would in fact be 18 people to whom the provisions of the constitution could apply in relation to being in the category of a senator for the purposes of section 44.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly that is not the case. The constitution quite clearly says that there can be only 12 senators in a particular state. Senator Harradine made the very neat point of order during Senator Schacht's speech and asked whether the standing orders apply to Senator-elect Ferris. Of course they do not. She does not enjoy the privileges of&mdash;dare I quote the constitution&mdash;`a sitting senator'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the important point that needs to be grasped; she does not enjoy the privileges of a sitting senator. Senator Harradine very neatly pointed that out with&mdash;and I am sure he will not mind me saying so&mdash;a frivolous point of order. But it made the point very neatly and is something that ought to be exercising the collective mind of the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is and there always was in the minds of the drafters of the constitution the situation <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that there would be senators-elect, because we in this place serve a fixed term, unless there is a double dissolution. One would have thought that the drafters of the constitution would have known that there would have been the three categories: those capable of being chosen; those who are currently, like Senator-elect Ferris, in limbo land, the senators-elect who do not get any privileges of office; and those who are sitting senators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The drafters of the constitution did not refer to senators-elect but referred to only the people going through the process of being chosen and those who are sitting as senators. So I think a very long bow is being drawn by the opposition in this matter. The constitution, I believe, is very clear and speaks for itself in relation to the categorisation of Senator-elect Ferris.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1234">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The motion that is before us suggests that the reference ought be going to the Court of Disputed Returns under section 376 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. Once again, it says `any question in respect of the qualifications of a senator' and it goes on. But we are not dealing with a senator; we are dealing with a senator&hyphen;elect. I would have thought that the drafters of this piece of legislation would have known and seen the difference between those two categories of people, because there is clearly within our system the position of a senator&hyphen;elect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It may well be that the High Court simply says, `Under section 376, the person whom you are referring to us is not a senator and therefore we do not have jurisdiction,' and bounces it right out without even considering the argument of section 44 of the constitution. That is why we are saying to you on the other side that, if you want to overcome that hurdle and really want to come to grips with what section 44 of the constitution means, delay the matter until after 1 July. Then you will be in the situation of being able to use section 376, because then Ms Ferris will be Senator Ferris. We may well go through the farcical situation where the High Court says, `Bad luck. She's not a senator. We can't entertain your application,' and then a month or two later go through it all again. Senator Schacht talks about natural justice. Is that fair, is that reasonable, to Ms Ferris? Of course, it is not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other matter that I refer to is section 370 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, which tells us that no party to the petition shall, except by consent of all parties or by leave of the court, be represented by a counsel or solicitor. Who is going to be representing the Senate in the arguments? Undoubtedly counsel. Therefore, one would assume and imagine that in the case of Ms Ferris, even if there was not consent of all the parties, leave would be granted by the High Court. She will incur considerable cost&mdash;possibly only to be told first off that she is not a senator under section 376. Then the taxpayers will have to pay the costs of that hearing, I would suggest, because under section 371 the court may award costs against an unsuccessful party to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a petition. Then we might have to revisit the whole issue a few months later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition, with respect, is moving with indecent haste in relation to this. I think their true motives have been exposed by the way they drafted the motion. They have been shamed out of the last three paragraphs, but Senator Schacht still could not help but make some very cheap political points. We on this side call those things the cheap shots of Senator Schacht. Why the indecent haste?
