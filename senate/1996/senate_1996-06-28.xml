<TIME.STAMP>(9.04 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I oppose the proposition regarding the Development Allowance Authority Amendment Bill. This issue has arisen essentially as a result of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) indicating that he wishes to reintroduce the concept of private roads attracting eligibility for infrastructure bonds. This is despite the fact that, on 15 December, the former Treasurer (Mr Willis) and the former Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) indicated that such roads should be exempt from future consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That action was taken after considerable public debate and discussion. As a result of that debate and discussion, attempts were made to address what is a quite significant policy imbalance in so far as it was discovered that the use of infrastructure bonds for private road development had in fact led to significant uneconomic actions being taken. Distortions were occurring in the use of these bonds in such a way as to render the public purse much lighter. In a most inefficient way they were producing a result which was of enormous benefit to a limited number of developers but of great cost to the public who had to use these facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The City Link project in Melbourne is the most obvious example. There is also the case of the M2 freeway in Sydney where similar sets of arrangements occurred under conservative state governments. These infrastructure bonds were used to feather the nests of their friends in the private sector, and legislation was introduced&mdash;in the case of Fahey and Kennett&mdash;using these infrastructure bonds to basically fleece the public of New South Wales and Victoria in such a way as to produce quite extraordinary outcomes for their friends but very limited benefits for the public of Sydney and Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of City Link, with which I am most familiar, an analysis of the City Link contract and state legislation detailed at least 66 ways in which the Victorian state government would provide financial assistance, guarantees and compensation for the Transurban consortium. An analysis demonstrated that the Victorian government had effectively underwritten the City Link project while publicly seeking to give the impression that the Transurban consortia would carry the commercial risk that one could reasonably expect to be associated with such a project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that case, a project which should cost $1.2 billion for construction&mdash;and one may argue about the benefits and merits of the particular project&mdash;in the end will cost some $8 billion in terms of repayment costs. That is as a result of a secret contract entered into between the Victorian government and Transurban with the effect that over a 34&hyphen;year period there would be guarantees of profits in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2524"> such a way as to produce results whereby the average motorist using those facilities would be paying, in today's terms, $1,500 per year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The state government undertook to provide direct and indirect assistance to the project to the extent that the effective risks would be transferred to Victorian taxpayers which, in my judgment, is quite contrary to the spirit and guidelines of the development allowance arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The state government provided City Link with a risk premium and effectively guaranteed Transurban a massive profit at taxpayers' expense to be enjoyed over the 34&hyphen;year life of this project. The state government strategy in this regard minimises Transurban's risk exposure. That should also be measured with such things as their so&hyphen;called agreed `traffic measures' which the former Minister for Transport, Laurie Brereton, described as a `state scandal' and a `policy obscenity' for corralling Melbourne motorists onto toll&hyphen;roads to be fleeced like sheep by the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This strategy involved: providing $300 million directly for associated infrastructure works; various exemptions from state measures; the legal enforcement of tolls; indemnification against interest rate rises; and protection and immunity from prosecution on a range of civil laws such as environmental laws in such a way as to undermine the rights of citizens who also had to share the Melbourne environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The compensation provisions of such contracts and legislation made the state liable in an extraordinary range of circumstances to pay Transurban compensation for such things as changes in Commonwealth and state policy. For example, they made sure that the consortia would be exempt from the application of various federal and state laws on the pain of substantial compensation to Transurban if such laws were introduced by either a federal or state government over the 34&hyphen;year life of this project. These changes also included a carbon tax, any conservation or other measures deemed to affect the revenues of the consortia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> As I read the arrangements entered into, clause 2.9 on page 296 of the City Link act provides 35 circumstances in which Trans urban may claim compensation from the state&mdash;35 circumstances in which so&hyphen;called private developers undertaking a private project could claim compensation from the people of this country. That could only lead one to conclude that the actions taken were, essentially, anti&hyphen;competitive and, in my view, quite clearly in breach of the spirit and intent of the development authority allowances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The anti&hyphen;competitive nature of the City Link project can be seen in a whole range of measures introduced by the state government in support of the project which can be clearly demonstrated to ensure a monopoly on: freight transport through linking the docks with the Melbourne airport; the closure of roads; road narrowings; and the removal of ancillary roads which are currently designated as clearways&mdash;Footscray Road, Swan Street, Toorak Road, Alexander Avenue, Batman Avenue, Boundary Road and Flemington Road&mdash;all of which are designed to reduce the capacity of alternative routes to the City Link project. Recently, the Commonwealth spent some $23 million upgrading Footscray Road&mdash;all that work will be undone as that road is to be narrowed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The One Nation package indicated significant improvements to transport movement in Melbourne. In Victoria the state government has acted to protect a particular consortia close to government. The infrastructure bonds are being used to protect that project and undermine the policy initiatives taken by the national government in other ways.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen prohibitions on the upgrading of public transport and parallel roads, which of course would compete with the City Link project. We have seen the prospect of compensation having to be paid if the state government were ever forced to provide a rail link, both a light rail or a heavy rail to carry freight. Such a prospect undermines the anti&hyphen;competitive nature of such contracts which go to the heart of these bonding arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also seen the way in which these anti&hyphen;competitive actions have been designed to funnel traffic onto City Link. Rather than clearing the streets of Melbourne and improving its traffic flows, it will in fact lead to traffic chaos.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2525">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This project will also affect access to various public institutions such as: the children's, the Royal Melbourne and women's hospitals along Flemington Road; various sporting facilities; the sports and entertainment precinct on the Yarra; the national rail depot, the development of which this parliament has extended considerable funds to; and the freight terminals in Footscray Road. Access to all these facilities will be directly compromised as a result of the state government's actions on this particular project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For these reasons, in December last year the then Labor government, in a press release issued by the former Treasurer and the former Minister for Transport on 15 December, indicated that urban road projects would not be eligible for infrastructure bonds in the future. Yet in the most sneaky, underhanded way this government has tried to introduce infrastructure bonds in a most provocative manner&mdash;and attribute motive to those of us in the Australian Labor Party who have campaigned hard against these issues for some time in the interests of the constituencies that we represent. This government has tried to re&hyphen;introduce these sordid arrangements, these `policy obscenities' as they have been described.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen that projects, such as the advice coming to the government through the Economic Planning Advisory Commission and the private infrastructure task force, are quite clearly an uneconomic use of resources. They are policy distortions which seek to lock in governments for a protracted period in such a manner as to line the pockets of private developers at the expense of the public. It is abundantly clear that such projects ought to be undertaken by the public sector, which can do the job much more effectively, much cheaper and much more efficiently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we see on the other hand is an ideological obsession by this government to protect its mates by ensuring that the resources of this country are transferred from the public benefit to the private benefit. When that happens, a very limited number of people are able to enjoy the benefit. To make sure they enjoy that benefit, the government is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> using the state apparatus to undermine the capacity of ordinary citizens to defend their rights. They are taking from people the right of legal protest, the right of legal appeal and the right to compensation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government then says that the federal parliament should support such actions by allowing infrastructure bonds, such as these, to be put at the disposal of these shysters. It seems to me that that is a totally inappropriate use of the infrastructure bonds, and that is a position that was recognised by the previous Labor government. In that context, it is a proposition that I very strongly supported at the time and it is a proposition that I still support.</PARA></SPEECH>

<STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(9.16 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government is insisting upon its amendments to the act, and we have just heard one Labor Party senator express his view about that. I want to say a few things about this issue, because it has now got to major proportions, and stupidly so. The government need not have forced the issue like this. By carrying on the way it has, it has exacerbated an issue that would otherwise have been resolved reasonably smoothly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say at the beginning that this legislation is our legislation, and we are supporting it. We supported it last year when we introduced it into parliament. We supported it in this place when we granted it exemption from the Hill motion, which would have delayed its consideration until the next session. We then voted for the bill after a brief debate. We also supported this legislation in the House yesterday. So any pretext that the opposition does not support this legislation is completely erroneous, inaccurate and misleading.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Short has made some outrageous claims in question time in the Senate. I have to say that similar claims have been made by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in the other place. They have claimed that somehow, because the Senate is supporting this legislation, we are threatening $2.5 billion worth of investment. That is a bit rich coming from Senator Short.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was Senator Short who opposed the passage of the principal act which this bill is proposing to amend. It was Senator Short <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2526"> who, on 17 June 1992, arranged for the motion in the Senate to be split from four bills to two, specifically so the then opposition could vote against the Development Allowance Authority Bill 1992. That bill became the principal act, and it is that act which this bill now seeks to amend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So this is another example of a breathtaking new turn by the coalition. As usual, they opposed a Labor initiative when they were in opposition for plain, base political reasons. Then, when they came into government, they had another look at it and thought that the Labor government was correct. Without any recognition of their past perfidy or any apology for their past performance, they have turned around and are now claiming that we are holding the process up. We are getting used to this sort of weird behaviour from the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to say a few things about the word `sabotage'. Sabotage was a word introduced into this debate by Senator Short. It comes from him. I have to say that this debate is getting nasty and vicious. I have in front of me a report from Mr Sharp, the Minister for Transport, which attacks the Leader of the Australian Democrats (Senator Kernot). He said that a move to block tax breaks for urban road projects would cause `more deaths on Australian roads'. They were his words. If he said that outside this place, I think that would be actionable, because it is untrue and has no other purpose than to attack the reputation of an individual.</PARA>

I think that is the obscenity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to say something about this claim of sabotage, a claim which I have to say is patently absurd. How exactly is the opposition threatening these investment projects? Apparently, this is by supporting&mdash;not opposing&mdash;the extension of the development allowance retrospectively to those projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We in the opposition identified the problem in the first place. We introduced the legislation. The coalition refused to pass it before the election and now we are supporting the consequentially reintroduced legislation. The only way in which any project is being threatened is if the government&mdash;or more specifically in this case the Treasurer&mdash;refuses to enact its own legislation. Is this what the government is proposing? If so, it should admit that this is the situation and stop raising red herrings against the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point that I want to make is this: does the government really believe that huge investments are going to cease or not proceed on the basis of the qualification for the development allowance? If so, Senator Short should state exactly which projects will be affected and the amount of development allowance that each project will be denied if the government&mdash;not the opposition or the Senate&mdash;refuses to enact this bill. Let us get the facts out. Do not make allegations. Put them down clearly where we can see which ones would be stopped, Senator Short.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Does the government honestly contend that a taxation concession of less than $10 million per annum spread across the whole economy is going to threaten the viability of $2.5 billion worth of projects? We must also remember that the legislation is retrospective. It applies back to the beginning of 1993, that is, 3&half; years ago. In addition, not only will the bill benefit those who have given their applications to the authority but also those who have withdrawn their applications because they thought they were not eligible, that is, those firms that thought they were not eligible and did not apply.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Did they abort their projects or did they simply carry on anyway? We believe that the latter is the truth. That is not to say that we will deny these firms fair treatment under taxation law, but let us not believe the fabrication that this is crucial to the survival of $2.5 billion worth of projects. If that were the case, it would mean that, even if all of the concessions of this bill were granted to these projects, it would amount to an alteration in the rate of return on $2.5 billion capital figure of around 0.4 per cent. If such a small  change made the projects non-viable, I doubt that investors and financiers would have risked their capital in investing in them in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, having said all that, I repeat that the opposition supports this bill. It had its genesis in our term of government, and it continues to have our full support. Any failure to enact it arises purely because of the lack of judgment of the Treasurer. The main reason that this bill is back here is the attitude of the government to amendments moved by Senator Kernot. These were good amendments because they implemented the policy of the previous government announced by former Ministers Willis and Brereton on 15 December last year.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I acknowledge that. These amendments proposed to implement our policy, and accordingly we support them. We supported them earlier in the week and we continue to support them. The real issue here is that the Treasurer has made a remarkable error of timing. I refer the Senate to the article by Alan Ramsey in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  on 26 June. It was headed `How plain bad timing took its toll'. This an example of the ineptitude of the Treasurer in this matter. It was bad timing by the Treasurer and bad policy by the Treasurer that have got the government into this situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of documents I would like to refer to. The first is the EPAC private infrastructure task force report, which concluded in the bottom paragraph on page xiii:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2528">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Contrary to a popular view, infrastructure as a whole is not significantly tax disadvantaged compared to most other investments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is therefore no strong `tax efficiency' case for retaining infrastructure bonds which indirectly provide a tax benefit to some private projects. The bonds have provided an incentive to lenders to infrastructure projects and this has served a useful catalytic role. However, the development of the capital markets largely removes the ongoing need for such concessions. Accordingly, the Task Force does not see a compelling case for retaining infrastructure bonds in the longer term.</PARA>
<PARA>That is EPAC in its private infrastructure task force report. The government's own Commission of Audit report has criticised taxation concessions as inefficient and generally undesirable relative to specific outlays measures. Page 295 of the `Charter of budget honesty' reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The different budgetary processes that apply to tax concessions and expenditure programs in Australia have contributed to the lack of transparency of tax expenditure reporting.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, spending on tax concessions is not monitored to the same extent as spending on programs. Treasury noted in its submission to the Commission that it can be three years before a tax expenditure is fully costed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Second, consideration of tax concession proposals is hampered by the general difficulty of accurately costing them. This difficulty stems in part from the lack of resources devoted to monitoring tax concessions compared to those devoted to monitoring programs, and the consequent insufficient level of information about tax expenditures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Third, unlike tax concessions, control of program expenditure is enhanced by individual Ministers being held responsible for spending by their portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, established procedures exist for the Department of Finance and the responsible portfolio to examine ways of containing blowouts in program expenditure but not blowouts in tax concessions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of all these factors, tax concessions are a largely non-transparent form of assistance. This lack of transparency makes less visible the effect of tax concessions on the budget and reduces accountability. It also increases the likelihood that poorly targeted concessions will remain on offer.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a further canard from the transport minister. As I said, he is claiming quite outrageously that the failure to reinstate the tax concession would cause more deaths on Australian roads. On that basis, the minister will be guilty himself if the Commonwealth reduces any road funding, which appears likely given the announcement that the Commonwealth will cut tied aid to the states by around three per cent this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, the Commonwealth has already welched on the general purpose funding arrangements put in place by us last year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has been a lot of muddying of where we started on this Development Allowance Authority Amendment Bill and what the government has to act on. The Senate passed the government's request to amend the Development Allowance Authority Act to extend one of the tax concessions controlled by the authority to a group of applicants whose companies had restructured since the applications for the allowance closed in 1992. The Senate said, `Yes, go ahead'. Then the Senate moved an amendment to restrict access to another tax concession controlled by the same authority&mdash;the infrastructure borrowing concession.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was astonished when Senator Short said that we should not have done that because we knew the government would not accept it; we were very naughty because we are only allowed to move amendments that the government will accept. The fact of the matter is that the majority of the Senate passed that amendment. That is appropriate; it happens all the time. It is then the government's call.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government had some choices. They could have chosen to accept the Senate amendment. That would have had the effect of allowing the development allowance to be claimed by those 40 firms&mdash;which, I might add, have not managed to get their developments off the ground in three years&mdash;and it would have re&hyphen;closed the outrageous tax rort on infrastructure borrowings which should not have been opened up again by this government. Those are choices. That would have been a good result. We would give a kick along for development and actually give a kick up the pants to the rorters they are seeking to assist. But the government chose <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not to do that. They chose to reject the Senate amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is saying, `If you insist on this amendment, legitimate applicants for the allowance will miss out.' That is an outrageous position for this government to take. It means that they are prepared to support tax rorters in preference to companies which are prepared to invest in Australia. Senator Short is pointing the finger and apportioning blame; he needs to look at his own actions. Given the rhetoric of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) over the last few weeks, it was an outrageous and bad public policy decision to seek to reinstate this concession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I too want to address the issue of sabotage. One of the disillusioning things about this place is to see how the heads change sides but the mouths say the same things. It was this government in opposition that thought it was entirely appropriate to amend the airports privatisation bill with an amendment to re&hyphen;open the east&hyphen;west runway and review the operation of the three runways. The Australian Democrats voted for that amendment and the bill was defeated. That was okay then. That was not sabotage. So do not be hypocritical and come in here and say, `But this is our bill and this time it is unacceptable because it does not fit, it is inappropriate.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us remember that the benefit of this rort does not build roads; it flows to the financiers and investors who are always cruising for a tax preferred investment. Two decades ago you would have found them cruising along the bottom of the harbour. A decade ago you would have found them producing movies that were never made. Now you find them offering to pay for toll roads.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government should look at what financial analysts like former Australian Stock Exchange member</PARA>
<PARA>Dick Tandar have to say about the creative financial structuring of some of those projects. Put it any way you like, they are quite simply rorts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">EPAC recognised that they were rorts. As Senator Cook pointed out, the government's own Commission of Audit recognised that they are rorts. Yet just two weeks after <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2530"> Treasurer Costello, hand on heart, was berating alleged rorts by state premieres and vowing that he would not stand by and allow the tax system to be rorted, here is the same Treasurer opening up a new rort. That is the wrong message for this government to be giving to the electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the government in budget preparation mode&mdash;horror budget preparation mode&mdash;for all their own accounts, cutting back on health, education, foreign aid, the ABC and age care services, and 9,500 jobs in the public sector so far. Yet at the same time they are reinstating a tax rort like this. I think it means that the arguments put forward by the government are totally spurious.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) is going the next step in saying that, because of the Senate amendments in my name, I am now responsible for road deaths because I am not allowing this government to give tax concessions for building tollways. It is rather sad that the minister in charge of transport does not understand the basic dynamics of traffic flow, that the more roads you build, the more traffic you have, often the faster the traffic moves and, with that, comes a likelihood of an increased number of people getting hurt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Irrespective of whether tollways are the best way to build roads, we need to look at some other arguments. You don't look only at the tax concessions; you have to ask, `What is the best way to build roads&mdash;the most efficient, effective and environmentally appropriate way possible to build roads?' Let's integrate them with public transport options; let's take the advice of EPAC. They warned that private sector tollways carry higher costs than public sector ones; costs like the massive legal and financial costs of setting up the funding structure, the higher cost of borrowing and the public subsidies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to ask the minister: why don't you take up EPAC's suggestion for a better alternative to funding tollways, the suggestion to allow the states to borrow outside Loan Council guidelines on a fully commercial basis? What is wrong with that principle, so that when the road is paid for, the profits flow back to the community, not into the pockets <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the private developers? Isn't that a benefit to the community? Isn't it true that that is the way the roads can be built more cheaply and with the costs being fully transparent? This is all in line with what you say is important in taxation policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do have to remember, even in the context of shock&hyphen;horror budgets, that the Australian government&mdash;I stress `government'&mdash;has the second lowest debt in the OECD. Given the debate about the eastern distributor in Sydney, it is important to remember that New South Wales has the second lowest debt of any Australian state. This government and the Carr government need to read up on the modern research about the massive economic benefits that flow from public investment in infrastructure. Then, I think, they would both realise that it makes sense to fund viable roads from public borrowings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What your rejection of our amendment means is that you are prepared to jeopardise what you categorise as important private sector developments because it is more important to you to defend such poor tax policy as your road rorts.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me just comment on the comments that have been made today. It is quite clear from the comments that we have heard from Labor&mdash;from Senator Cook and Senator Carr&mdash;and from Senator Kernot and Senator Margetts that, basically, the debate has not been about this bill; it has really been about philosophical and ideological views about the development of roads, and the balance between road development&mdash;which is basically for private transport&mdash;and public transport. I think Senator Carr's contribution to this debate was heavily underlaid by that. That is the first point I would make.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point I make is that much of what has been discussed up to date is really irrelevant to this bill because the decisions about whether roads go ahead and the nature of road projects are a matter for state governments. They have nothing to do with the federal government as such. The decision of whether you have a City Link, an eastern distributor or some other road project is a matter for state decision. That has always been clear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say a couple of things about the road projects that have been mentioned, and I will also come to the EPAC report. So far as City Link is concerned&mdash;and Senator Carr waxed very eloquent in opposition about it&mdash;the fact is, as Senator Carr is well aware, that the application for the development allowance provisions for the City Link project was given the tick by the then Treasurer Ralph Willis last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition can go on as much as they like about the City Link project, but it was their government that saw the City Link project eligible for the development allowance. The Victorian Auditor-General, who I think is universally regarded as pretty independent, Mr Baragwanath, gave the City Link project and the matters relating to it a pretty favourable tick in his review of the project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Cook asked me about providing information on applicants for the development allowance. A list of development allowance projects is not available, because part 4 of the DAA Act requires the development authority on request to keep details of applications confidential. As release of project names could identify applicants and commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen; confidence information, typically only aggregated data is released. However, details of projects are released after the approvals have been finalised and the applicants agree to it. So part 4 of the act is the answer to the question Senator Cook raised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A bill was introduced here last year by the previous government. I think it was virtually identical to the bill that the new government has introduced. The former government's bill had bipartisan support&mdash;it had the support of all sections of the chamber, as I understand <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2532"> it&mdash;but it did not get passed because of the intervention of the election process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 2 January this year, the former Assistant Treasurer Mr Gear issued a press release to assure business and industry groups that the amendments would proceed despite the delays in the passage of the bill. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Government supports the passage of the Bill as a matter of priority.</PARA>
<PARA>But in recent days the then government, the now opposition, has qualified that by saying that support depends on the passage of the former Treasurer's announcement relating to infrastructure borrowings. The opposition has now qualified the bill it introduced, which had bipartisan support. Until Monday of this week, it had supported this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there has been a joining of Labor, the Democrats and the Greens to&mdash;as I have said in the chamber before, and I will say it again&mdash;jeopardise, to threaten, to put at grave risk, the entitlement to the development allowance of about 40 large projects in Western Australia, Queensland and South Australia, which have investments of $2.5 billion over the period from now to the year 2002, if they do not pass this bill.</PARA>

I am advised that there is one very serious error in the statement because it says, amongst other things:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The tollway tax rort operates in two ways. Investors can borrow up to 100 per cent of the cost of buying infrastructure bonds and claim the interest as a tax deduction, then they pay no tax on the interest received from financiers on the infrastructure bond, a massive tax boost for banks and the wealthy.</PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased to see Senator Kernot is here. The situation is that tax is paid on that interest. The tax, though, is paid by the borrowers. So there is not the rorting of the system that Senator Kernot and the Democrats have been alleging.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will turn now to the report by EPAC which has been drawn on extensively by the Democrats and the Labor Party to support their claims that urban roads should not be included in the allowance. That is really just a smokescreen to hide the internal conflict that has been occurring for a long time within the ALP over toll roads in Sydney. The EPAC report has been extensively misquoted and misinterpreted.

<PARA>At the time of the EPAC report, infrastructure borrowings were the greatest thing since sliced bread so far as the former government was concerned. Just two months later, after Bob Carr reneged on his promise to remove tolls on the residents of western Sydney, the government decided that infrastructure borrowings for urban roads were not such a great idea. The previous government wanted to ensure that it was not embarrassed by Bob Carr breaking further promises on toll roads. That is what this is all about.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Did the ALP remove infrastructure borrowings for all road and rail projects? Of course it did not. It did not because it was not interested in the EPAC findings at all.

That is a matter for legitimate argument and debate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said before, whether these projects proceed or not is a matter for the state governments. It is not a matter for the Commonwealth government.

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, the claim is that we introduced legislation making changes on the transfer benefit to the development <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2535"> allowance, which was clearly announced. We do not dispute that Senator Short said that the then assistant Treasurer confirmed those arrangements in January of this year, but that was after the then Treasurer, Mr Willis, announced that we were excluding road projects from being eligible for the allowance. When this bill was first introduced into the parliament, that still seemed to be the policy that the new government had adopted, which we had announced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But earlier this week, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) announced a change of policy&mdash;that road projects were now going to be again allowed to receive the benefit. That is a significant change in the policy announced by the then government on the road projects. It seems to me quite reasonable that, if the Senate so chooses to amend the bill back to the original policy that the Labor government announced, that is our right, and it is in no way inconsistent  with this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As my colleague Senator Cook quite rightly pointed out earlier this morning, Alan Ramsey, in his article, pointed out that, again, this government, by sheer bungling of timing, brought this on at the same time as Mr Costello was arrogantly announcing the change of policy, and that if he did not carry it out because the bill had not been introduced and gone through, he could do this by ministerial decree and the allowance for roads could be reintroduced. He did not realise that this bill&mdash;his own bill from his own department&mdash;was being introduced into the Senate this week. He has been absolutely caught out. Typical arrogant Treasurer! This is another performance by this Treasurer who believes that whatever he decrees must absolutely be the final outcome and that any other view can be ignored.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Short is playing in a very imaginative way but not in a correct way by saying that the present opposition has a different policy. We are the ones who are consistently maintaining the policy that we announced in December, which was that road projects should be excluded from being eligible for the allowance. That is why we are supporting the amendment moved first of all by Senator Kernot. I believe that Senator Short should <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> stick to that fact. It is his bad luck in one sense and our good luck, that Mr Costello&mdash;without realising where this bill was in the parliamentary process&mdash;made his arrogant press statement early this week that spilt the beans and gave us a chance as a parliament to defend our policy which we announced in December of last year.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(10.11 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I see no relevance between the east&hyphen;west runway and this matter. I will make two points in response to Senator Kernot's questions and comments. I make this response in reply to the Labor Party's comments and criticisms as well. The fact is that when the former government introduced this identical bill late last year&mdash;and I do not have the exact date&mdash;the then government did not include anything to do with the roads issue. That is why I am saying it is hypocritical.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor government introduced a bill which we have followed almost to the letter. It had nothing to do with the question of the inclusion or exclusion of roads. As we all acknowledge, it is true that subsequently the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2536"> then Treasurer made a statement which was not followed up in legislation, presumably because of the electoral timetable. Senators might recall that there was a great deal of debate at the time as to whether it would exclude the City Link project or not. As I said earlier in this debate, the then government and the former Treasurer, Mr Willis, deliberately allowed City Link to be included in the provisions of the Development Allowance Authority. The real reason why this has all come about, and the only reason why Labor made the policy decision that it did towards the end of last year, was the political embarrassment that was occurring as a result of the actions of Bob Carr in New South Wales. That was the basis for everything that has gone on subsequently so far as Labor is concerned in this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will return to a couple of the points made by Senator Kernot concerning the taxation position of the Development Allowance Authority. If Senator Kernot is concerned about the tax concessionality element contained in the bill concerning roads and if she follows that through consistently, she should be saying that the whole of the Development Allowance Authority ought to be abolished because the same principle in terms of the tax concessionality applies to any project, whether it is a road, mining or electricity project. Why is Senator Kernot drawing a distinction between roads and everything else? She might care to answer that question for me. She cannot hang it on the EPAC report because that report does not give her strong supporting evidence to mount that proposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats and opponents in this area claim that there are excessive tax benefits to the rich at the expense of the general taxpayer through Develop Australia Bonds. This seems to be what Senator Kernot and Labor, so far as roads but not anything else, seem to be saying. They claim that no tax is charged on the interest received. They also claim that the size of the parcel of bonds issued is such that only the very rich can afford them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite frankly, claims of that nature cannot be sustained. The cost to revenue of Develop Australia Bonds is relatively small. Under the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> infrastructure borrowings legislation, the revenue cost on non&hyphen;assessable interest payments to investors is offset by recouping most of that cost directly from the infrastructure borrower, who loses his tax deductibility on the interest paid. That is the point I made to Senator Kernot earlier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Develop Australia Bonds do not result to any significant extent in an increase in the quantum of tax deductions over time. Rather, some deductions are obtained earlier at a higher marginal rate. Forgone revenue is, for the greater part, clawed back in the longer term as the infrastructure projects start to generate net taxable income at an earlier point than would have been the case without Develop Australia Bonds. In the short term, the cost to revenue of the program is relatively modest. The revenue cap ensures that, in the short term, revenue forgone does not exceed the limits set by government regulation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You and your party thought that the inclusion of roads in the act was a pretty good thing. Then, because Bob Carr started to cause you huge embarrassment, you did a 180 degree backflip and suddenly changed your policy. Do not talk to me about consistency in policy. This debate could go on interminably. I am not sure that it really gets to the heart of the issue. The issue is that the government believes very strongly indeed that the bill as introduced should stand unamended. It is an identical bill to the one that was introduced by the former government. That bill had bipartisan support. This bill, until recent days, had bipartisan support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge the opposition to reconsider its position. The implications of not passing this <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2537"> bill as introduced are very significant. As I have said, 40 projects involving $2.5 billion of investment could be put at very significant risk by this. In that context, I draw as an example the fact, which was reported by the Victorian Auditor-General when he was looking at the City Link project, that there is no doubt that project would not have gone ahead had the then government excluded it from the provisions of the development allowance. There is no doubt that many of the projects which will now be affected by the intransigence of the opposition on this matter may very well fall into precisely the same situation. I do not think I have anything else to add, unless people want to ask specific questions. It is pretty clear where we all are. We should get on with the business of the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

Senator Parer may not have heard that I was asked a question by his minister. He asked me why I single out roads. The answer is that I do not single out roads; I take it on a case by case basis. I am quite astonished that you are approving the concession for a coal&hyphen;fired private power station at a time when we are all arguing about greenhouse targets and alternative energy. That needs to be considered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister's adviser can laugh all he likes. It happens to be my view that it is inappropriate. The second thing that is relevant is that the developmental allowance was closed off on 31 December 1992. It is part of the One Nation statement. It had a function and it has achieved that function. We agreed that it achieved the function of kick-starting <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> private investment and infrastructure. There is a role for that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why we are now quibbling, in your words, over these other developments is a little irrelevant. It is all closed off. We have had that public policy debate. Finally, you said that the Labor Party changed its policy. I say, `Thank goodness for that. They were wrong. They have learnt.' We opposed it when they supported this concession to City Link.

<PARA>In support of moving these amendments again, I will briefly say that these two amendments refer to the issue of policy by&hyphen;laws and enhance ministerial discretion under the policy by&hyphen;laws provision. This enables companies to make application to the minister for the level of duty to be waived on the importation of particular goods and, if the minister finds favour with their submissions, he is able to do that. The bill as it currently stands means that the minister's discretion would only reduce it down to three per cent of duty. The amendment enables the minister to reduce it down to zero.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We would like to insist on these amendments because they relate to three areas under the act: items 55, 57 and 60. Item 55 relates to machine tools for working advanced metals; item 57 relates to high performance raw materials and intermediate goods, and item 60 relates to high performance food packaging materials.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that this nation, Australia, is developing industry which uses machine tools for working advanced metals. In fact, it is a growing industry; it is one in which we are very competitive throughout the world. It is an area of high technology. It is important to sophisticated manufacturing, and it is an area in which we ought not impose a penalty on the industry when, by imposing a penalty, the industry's chances of growing stronger will be stunted. Therefore a company ought to be able to apply to the minister and the minister ought to have the discretion to remove all duty on imported goods necessary to the growth of this industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same remarks can be made of high performance raw materials and intermediate goods. Basically, this refers to chemicals, plastics and paper used in production which offer a performance advantage over substitutable goods produced in Australia. Again this is at the sophisticated end of the manufacturing chain. These are the industries we want in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2541"> this country. The minister should have the discretion on the facts to waive duty. The final area of high performance food packaging material&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is very important, as Senator Schacht interjects&mdash;and he interjects quite rightly. As a country, Australia has a world advantage in food production. We are acknowledged around the globe as a site for the production of clean and green agricultural products. That is our reputation in Asia. Getting those food products to the Asian market in pristine condition is an important consideration for our industry, and high performance food packaging materials enable that to be done. If our food is not on the supermarket shelves of Asia in a way that is attractive to Asian consumers&mdash;that is, fresh, crisp, green and clean&mdash;then our ability to win an even greater share of that market would be reduced. Therefore, the packaging material used to keep it in that pristine condition is an important consideration. These are mainly metal materials and goods which offer a performance advantage over similar goods produced in Australia. That is what item 60 relates to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I repeat that these are all key industries to enable Australia to grow in world stature as a competitive nation, to produce jobs for Australians which are sophisticated, highly skilled jobs which challenge them intellectually, and which draw on the technical training and skill we have in this country. All of these are areas on which, if the bill stands, the government will impose a tax of three per cent. It seems to me that that tax goes against the evolution of these industries and the jobs that they will create. All we ask is that, in appropriate cases, where it can be made under a by&hyphen;law application to the minister, the minister have discretion to remove the tax and provide zero.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are problems that the Greens still see with the Customs Tariff Amendment (No. 1) Bill. I do not think the use of tariffs in the way they are presented in this bill is a good idea. As senators know, the Greens have not been anti&hyphen;tariffs. We believe <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that support for industry should have a rational base. If we are going to support industry, we should work out how we do it, what is the best method to do it. We are not anti&hyphen;tariff. We believe we should know what we want to do with tariffs so we have a clear understanding. We certainly cannot get a clear understanding from this bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When speaking to the opposition amendments Senator Cook mentioned section 60. We have looked at section 60 which, from the headings, includes 72, 73, 74 and 78&mdash;metal materials and goods as prescribed by by&hyphen;law classified within chapters 72 and 78 of schedule 3 which are ineligible for a tariff concession order and, in the opinion of the minister, have a substantial and demonstrable performance advantage in the packaging of food over materials and goods currently available in Australia. We are talking iron and steel, copper, nickel, aluminium, lead and zinc. What sort of advanced food packaging did you have in mind here?</PARA></SPEECH>
<SPEECH PAGE="2541" TIME="10.44 a.m." SPEAKER="Cook, Sen Peter" NAMEID="RF4" ELECTORATE="WA" PARTY="ALP" GOV="0">

<STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(10.44 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This sort of food packaging arises because those input metals can be wrought as alloys or as metals in their own right which guarantee the proper temperature control or insulation, or are light which thus means that the cost of transport is reduced over heavier metals in getting the goods from Australia to a foreign market where the cost differential against Australia is higher than the cost differential against a continental neighbouring country in that market.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Implicit in your question, I think, Senator Margetts is this issue, if I may articulate it this way: this would enable the minister to exercise discretion to allow those goods that are made overseas to come into Australia to facilitate the transport of Australian products both domestically and internationally. The judgment call the minister will have to make is what steps he, as the minister, can take to encourage the domestic producers of those materials to be competitive and provide materials that provide those performance criteria of equal standard to the imports.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, most importantly, foodstuffs are front and centre the biggest export industry for Australia and the ones with the potentially greatest <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2542"> growth, and this is particularly apposite given the high growth figures of Asian economies, their huge population and their demand for more and better foodstuffs of higher quality and greater variety. So he has to make a decision about growing foodstuffs and increasing the exports of that industry by facilitating the use of these materials that cannot be duplicated in the domestic market. But those materials go to the weight, temperature control, packaging and presentation and, at the end of the day, the cost and the marketability of the goods that I am talking about, which are mainly foodstuffs.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was helpful. The image that first arose in my head in reference to advanced food packaging was some new sort of plastic film or something of that nature. We are talking about canned goods.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On Senator Cook's amendments, No.1 seems to be okay from the Greens' point of view. It removes the higher tariff on capital equipment used in manufacturing advanced materials. Australia is a source of feedstock for many advanced materials. It is silly to make downstream processing of these materials more expensive, especially as we are encouraging the manufacturers' products with a very high level of value adding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On amendment No.2, we are not too happy that there is no straight concession on goods not produced here. Senator Cook's amendments would allow ministerial discretion to extend a tariff&hyphen;free status, explicitly any good under items 57 or 60 of schedule 4, whether or not an equivalent good is produced in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the current legislation, goods which have no equivalents produced in Australia are allowed in free and goods which have equivalent goods produced here have the potential to be allowed in free with ministerial discretion. In other words, there is a straight objective hurdle which grants a tariff&hyphen;free concession and then a discretionary factor where a minister can be lobbied by the big corporate entities and may grant a similar concession to those who fail a test.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DX5">Senator MARGETTS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. But, basically, it will get down to the people who can lobby the most effectively. Personally, the Greens would like to see these concessions clearly set out so that everybody knows what concessions apply, rather than have them based on the effectiveness or power of the lobbying group.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to what happens to those who fail the test, Senator Cook is reversing the current situation. He is seeking to set the ministerial discretion to allow a minister to eliminate tariffs if the lobbying is effective, and to adjust the legislation so that discretion is allowed to cover goods where equivalent goods are not produced here. The effect of the wording would be to allow concession goods to be included in discretion, because under the current act they are excluded. In effect, the amendments will ensure that, if a company fails in their lobbying, then they can fall back on the three per cent concessional rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will make ministerial discretion the most powerful thing with a three per cent tariff as a backup second choice for companies that can argue that their imports fit the criteria. I do not particularly like that system. The problem lies where lobbying power is stronger than a more equitable and open system of non&hyphen;discretionary hurdle jumping. I do not like the fact that it means goods that have equivalent goods produced here, can get a lower tariff than goods that have no equivalent goods produced here just because somebody's lobbying power is greater than somebody else's.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not convinced that in the face of a decision to reduce the tariff concession from zero to three per cent the minister will be able to use this discretion to reinstate a zero concession on any broad or equitable basis. Perhaps either the minister or Senator Cook could respond to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish most of the goods in items 72 to 81 of schedule 3&mdash;basically, industry inputs of non&hyphen;machine metal products&mdash;would get a zero concession. Item 82, which includes cutlery and tools, is a little more problematic. I do not know why cutlery should be included. It all refers to goods covered in item 60 of schedule 3.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2543">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Item 57 of schedule 4 is a little more problematic for us, since a number of goods may go to industries we personally do not think should be here from a Greens' perspective. My response to Senator Cook's remarks on the concept of plastics for advanced food packaging is an example.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not that enthusiastic about promoting heavily packaged foods. We would obviously have problems with promoting particular types of packaging anyway, depending on whether they are recyclable and do not easily break down and cause a variety of environmental problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Frankly, the Greens' position on lots of these issues is that the process should be open and honest. We should have a means by which we can include through some form of sales tax differential those kinds of differences. If environmental costs are involved, they should be built into the cost of the product&mdash;I realise that the problematical categories have probably just been included as a part of item 39 of schedule 3. So a whole lot of goods have been lumped in as part of item 39 of schedule 3.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this sounds confusing to everybody, it is why at the dot last night we found that we were not able to make a decision. It is quite a complicated issue. It includes a whole range of polymer products, including resins for carbon fibre products. I would rather items such as chapter 48 paper and paper board had no possibility of inclusion. Quite frankly, I am sure a lot of companies in Australia would like to reduce the $2 billion worth of imports if they could, in an environmentally friendly way, produce them in Australia. On the whole, we can quite happily support amendment 1. We are not really convinced about amendment 2, although we realise that it is clearing up an existing anomaly. Either way, we oppose the bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<STATE> (South Australia)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(10.52 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Margetts has raised a very important issue regarding what I would call the transparencies or the process of granting a policy by-law and the lobbying process that goes with it. As a former minister responsible for the policy by&hyphen;law process for a couple of years, I agree that these questions <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> raised by Senator Margetts are very relevant. However, I want to point out to her that, as I discovered very rapidly, there is a very detailed legal process established with regard to policy by-laws. They are not a simple issue. It is not simply a matter of a minister capriciously granting a policy by&hyphen;law to someone who is more effective in lobbying than someone else. If that happened under the existing law, I have no doubt that minister would rapidly be before a court facing a major dispute with somebody who opposed the granting of the policy by&hyphen;law. Conversely, if the minister did not grant the policy by&hyphen;law, it could be challenged that he took that decision capriciously.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister in these cases acts under the law and the regulations on the advice of the departments. In both the DIST and Customs there are delegated offices who have to carry out a proper due process of seeking the information and explaining why a policy by-law can be granted after a tariff concession has been refused. That process may be very complicated, and that may be one of its worst aspects, but it is complicated because we are trying to be fair and transparent in the running of the system. So that is not an issue I have concern with because I have sat through the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My main complaint may be that, because a system is made transparent and in a way that means a capricious decision cannot be made, we have very complicated rules and processes. This means that a whole industry of consultants lives from giving advice to companies about the process of obtaining a policy by-law. If there is an area of micro-economic reform that may be useful in this country, it would be reducing the need for companies to have consultants advising them about the granting of policy by&hyphen;laws. That would be very useful, in my view, because it would reduce the cost to industry. Again, it is very much a function of the rules this parliament has imposed that ensures the capriciousness or off&hyphen;handed approach of a minister being heavily influenced or lobbied by somebody in that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2544"> Though it is true that in certain industries and certain areas there would be large com panies applying for policy by&hyphen;laws, plenty of smaller companies can and do apply for them and have them granted. If you look at the total picture of obtaining a policy by&hyphen;law for major projects, it is by definition. When it was at $50 million, obviously it would be a bigger company or a major organisation putting forward that project because of the size of the project. As I understand it, this bill has reduced the policy by-law size down to $10 million for major projects. I think that will enhance smaller businesses and smaller organisations being able to access the advantage of policy by-laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know whether Senator Margetts will trust the advice of a former minister on this issue, but I can assure her that there are very strict procedures. It is actually not the minister who signs the policy by-law. He signs a note that the recommendation coming from the departments is in accordance in his view with the government's policy initiatives. Senator Cook has outlined the reasons why we believe there is a policy outcome for the development of Australian industry to be more export oriented and export competitive: the creation of jobs and growth in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Margetts raised concern about amendment No. 2, which deals with the use of chemicals. It is unavoidable that plastics will have to be used from time to time and chemicals will be used to promote the use of the production of plastics. To try to separate plastic out because of its polluting quality or its littering of the landscape I would think would be very difficult under item 57. Though her concern is reasonable to raise, I do not think the three per cent ought to be reduced to zero. We believe that overall we receive wider benefits from the promotion of these industries. It will make them more competitive and will create more jobs in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Cook outlined the policies regarding the agrifood area. The former government's policy&mdash;and I hope it will be the new government's policy&mdash;was to take further advantages from being able to produce clean, green food in Australia. We exported it, properly processed, at a very high quality so <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that that clean, green feature even when processed is recognised around the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In some cases, it will involve plastic packaging to maintain freshness. Senator Margetts might be aware that CSIRO and others have developed plastic packaging that maintains THE freshness for three months of the exported clean, green Australian agricultural product. That means that people overseas are getting access to food that is less processed, fresher and more nutritious. The plastic not only benefits our industry but also improves the nutrition level of the less processed food for people overseas. You have to weigh up the advantages of a plastic that can be produced as cheaply as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The performance of the government on the issue of tariff concessions and policy by&hyphen;laws over the last couple of months has been convoluted and contorted to say the least. They accepted the position we announced in the budget when in government of abolishing the tariff concession system. When the now Treasurer, Mr Costello, and the then shadow finance minister, Mr Prosser, accepted our announcement about savings, I do not think they understood as we did the impact it would have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were quite open about the impact. We knew that some people would disagree with the decision. But in order to ensure that all our election promises were funded, that was the responsible decision that we took. It has been a bit of a circus since the election, with the new government trying to understand the impact of all of this and then trying to come up with their own significant change, which is that the tariff concession system would not be abolished but would continue at three per cent, with consumer goods included and three per cent applied to policy by&hyphen;laws in a number of areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a misunderstanding of the reason policy by&hyphen;laws were established in the first place. Originally, it was to grant a complete exemption from tariff. When you fail on a tariff concession to get the exemption, there are good policy reasons, as Senator Cook has explained, why the policy by&hyphen;law system would operate to allow, under the circumstances outlined in the rules, those products <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2545"> to be imported without paying any tariff at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot see the difference between having a tariff concession operating in a number of areas at three per cent and a policy by&hyphen;law operating in some areas at three per cent. Obviously, if you have a policy by&hyphen;law operating at zero there is an advantage over a tariff at three per cent. But why, if you were rejected for a tariff concession at three per cent, would you apply for a policy by&hyphen;law which still hits you with three per cent?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the confusion the government is in because its ministers have not understood the basic difference between a tariff concession process and the policy by&hyphen;law. I again make the point that it indicates that the government has got itself into a very confused and convoluted state in trying to work out this system to appease the lobbying going on from various groups in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we made the announcement that we would abolish the tariff concession system we said that the policy by&hyphen;laws would still apply in all categories and, with respect to project status, we would drop it from $50 million to $10 million. The government is still doing that. But we did not say that some policy by&hyphen;laws would operate at a three per cent level. We said that all our policy by&hyphen;laws would continue to operate and at a zero level. If you can prove a policy case in terms of the national interest&mdash;to develop Australian industry&mdash;you should have access to that process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now have a convoluted outcome. Fortunately, I think the government has accepted the amendments proposed by the opposition and the other parties to exclude consumer goods, as we excluded them in our announcement when we were in government. At that time I do not think the then opposition understood the difference between consumer and business items. We certainly did, and that is why we made the announcement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the list was finally tabled the other day in answer to a question on notice&mdash;a list which ran to a couple of thousand consumer items&mdash;you could see that putting the tariff concession at even three per cent on those items would be a substantial new tax. Let's <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not beat around the bush: it is a new tax; in its own way it is a mini GST applying to consumer items in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition parties in the Senate have done a very good job in forcing the government to back away from that measure. I still think that it is a mistake to apply a three per cent tariff to some of the policy by&hyphen;laws. In some cases it makes policy by&hyphen;laws irrelevant because with the tariff at three per cent you are saying, `You missed out on the tariff concession, so apply for a policy by&hyphen;law&mdash;but if you get it we will still hit you with three per cent.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is just ridiculous. You might as well abolish the policy by&hyphen;law of three per cent in all those areas and just stick to the tariff concession. But that is a bit difficult for the intellectual capacity of these ministers. That is why we have the very higgledy&hyphen;piggledy outcome with which we in the opposition are very kindly trying to help.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I could not find too much in there, Senator O'Chee. You can use up as much time as you like in interjections because that is the object of the exercise. I am concerned about considering this legislation urgent when we are dealing with something which has such a long history.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In dealing with the issue of foreigners we are talking about an example that goes back <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to the absolute paradigmatic history of Israel. In being rescued from Egypt this became the fundamental principle for them in all their relationships with other people and other nations. When they are reminded that they should care for foreigners in their own land because they were foreigners in Egypt what we are touching on is the fundamental paradigm of their history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this Senate believes in following on that historical tradition, which goes back to the earliest recordings of history, then we must take account of the obligation which is put upon us to care for foreigners, migrants and refugees in our own country. I believe this legislation, which some senators want to make urgent, flies in the face of that very principle and contradicts it in a most fundamental way. It would deprive those who are prisoners, foreigners or refugees in our land of the kind of basic assistance which they need. That flies in the face of the principle which I have just enunciated. I know that at this stage we are debating the cut off motion and the urgency of the legislation. When we get to the substantive motion I will develop this principle at greater length.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator McGauran asked me about the New Testament. The principle carries through there very clearly. In one of the parables of Jesus we have the words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You that are accursed, depart from me into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels; for I was hungry . . . thirsty . . . a stranger and you did not welcome me . . . Truly I tell you, just as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to me.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate having that drawn to my attention. We are debating a motion to have this legislation exempted from the order of the Senate and debated now.

The fact that we have been debating this principle for 3,000 years&mdash;and it has been suggested that it is necessary for us to make some decision in this place on this principle, which is contravened by this legislation&mdash;quite clearly shows that it cannot be treated in a cavalier sense or any sense of urgency.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He was assisting me. Father Brennan writes:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Surely there is a need to guarantee that any person detained on Australian territory is able to have access to legal advice to determine the legality of the detention. In the case of asylum seekers held in a remote place like Port Hedland, I would have thought that HREOC was the appropriate body to provide such a service or to give public assurance that such a service is being provided. The availability of the service should not be contingent on a detainee having sufficient command of English, Australian law and political process to make an undeniable request.</PARA>
<PARA>Father Brennan is outlining the absolutely critical nature of legislation which takes away fundamental human rights. He writes further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the detainee's migration status is a factor in determining the legality and propriety of the detainee's detention, the person providing legal advice must be in a position to advise on that status. An asylum seeker's right to such advice once again cannot be made contingent on the asylum seeker's capacity to contact HREOC or a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> solicitor. The same minimum access should be guaranteed to all asylum seekers.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>That is again underlying the fact that we cannot deal in this cavalier fashion with this legislation&mdash;legislation which is so fundamental, which so contradicts fundamental human rights and principles of ethics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not a bill which is urgent. Certainly the debate is important&mdash;I do not deny that for one moment. It is a critical and important debate, but it is certainly not urgent. It is one that we can continue to have in the coming months and certainly one which can be addressed in the budget session. Again, Father Brennan makes a very good point in the letter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Surely the Immigration Department and HREOC could work out an appropriate protocol for providing independent advice on the legality of detention and the process for determination of migration status, ensuring that the HREOC is not the vehicle for solicitors touting for business nor for asylum seekers buying time through the fabrication of claims.</PARA>
<PARA>We certainly do not want that to happen. However, Father Brennan writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would be horrified to learn that all major political parties colluded to ensure that persons detained in a remote place were denied independent legal advice to establish the legality of the detention. Being a patron of Refugee Week, I am sure to be asked for public comment on this issue during the course of the week.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not think any one of us could deny the theological, the legal or the ethical commitment of Father Brennan. I thought that I might underline this, too, by a quote from John Paul II, who said this in 1990. Are you listening, Senator McGauran?</PARA>

It is something that needs extended and serious consideration. The Democrats will be opposing exemption from the cut&hyphen;off motion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a matter of fact, Father Brennan wrote also to Senator Christopher Ellison, Chairman of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. Again, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Uniya and the Jesuit Refugee Service Australia has significant concerns regarding the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No 2) 1996</EMPHASIS> , currently before Parliament.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Migration Act</EMPHASIS>  provides in section 256 that people who request access to a lawyer must be given the opportunity to contact a lawyer, however, the Immigration Department's practice is not to tell people of this right.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise also to put forward the outrage and the concern that the Australian Democrats feel towards the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996 that is before the chamber today. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Specifically, I rise now to argue that this bill should not be exempt from the cut&hyphen;off motion. I concur with the comments that have been made so ably by my colleagues Senators Bourne and Woodley. You ended on an appropriate note, Senator Woodley. It is indeed not only shameful that this legislation has come to the parliament at all, but also particularly ironic and disturbing that this legislation finds its way to the parliament during refugee week. I also note, Senator Woodley, your appeal to fellow senators in this place not to vote for this bill or indeed to allow this bill to be exempt from the cut&hyphen;off motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it interesting that last night we listened with perhaps awe and interest to the tales of humanitarian efforts and civil libertarian efforts of many senators, specifically retiring senators in this chamber, and yet today we are faced with a decision that tests that mettle, that tests people's willingness to stick to those humanitarian and civil libertarian principles and commitments that we were heralding last night in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I rise to support my Democrat colleagues and also the Green senators who have risen to speak in this debate so far and to condemn quite universally the contents of the bill put forward today. What does the bill do? I find nothing in this bill that is urgent or that requires a hasty decision. I see no reasons why this bill should be exempt from the cut&hyphen;off. I have heard no good reasons from those opposite as to why this bill should be exempt from the cut&hyphen;off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at what the bill is designed to do. It does two things. Firstly, it ensures that neither the minister nor his department has <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2551"> any obligation to give a person in immigration detention an application form for a visa unless a direct request for such a form is made in accordance with section 256 of the Migration Act 1958. Secondly, where a person in immigration detention has not made a direct complaint to either the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission or the ombudsman, the bill removes the rights of the detainee to receive communications from those authorities. These are two shameful aspects of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why should we proceed with haste? Indeed, why should we proceed at all with such retrograde and regressive functions as outlined in the bill? There is absolutely no reason. First of all, I do not believe that we have seen due process and consultation adhered to. In fact my understanding is&mdash;and Senator Woodley might be able to advise us on this&mdash;that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commissioner has willingly accepted the idea of sitting down with the government, relevant departments and ministers over the winter recess to consult.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="WOODLEY" NAMEID="HX5">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HX5">Senator Woodley</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And today!</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I6">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And today. In fact I  understand that he has made himself available all this week. Furthermore, he has indicated that he will sit down and consult with the appropriate departments and ministers over the winter recess so that a more appropriate outcome can be achieved. As I understand it, to date there has not been adequate consultation, feedback, negotiation or discussion. Certainly Democrat offices&mdash;and I am sure Senator Bell and Senator Woodley would concur&mdash;have been inundated with requests, pleas, letters and phone calls from people who are affected, not just lawyers, but people who are concerned in the wider community, as well as the chief human rights watchdogs in our community, the powers of which this bill seeks to curtail. I speak specifically of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and the ombudsman's office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What expert opinion has been gained? We had an urgent committee meeting on this bill. I am sorry that Senator Bourne is not here to advise me, but I understand it is very rare for <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a committee not to be given the opportunity to sit on a Friday to discuss the matters contained in a bill before it. In fact, I understand that the secretariat of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee worked for 36 hours straight. They had no sleep the night before last, so urgent was the inquiry to look into this regressive bill. There has not been adequate consultation, feedback or negotiation, despite people's pleas and the willingness of those bodies involved in this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is part of a disturbing trend that is developing, the trend of bashing minority groups in our community. We should hold contempt for those people who pander to the prejudices of others. But we are not doing that in this place today; we seek to perpetuate those prejudices. It is the role of the people in this place to take moral leadership, not pander to some of the base discrimination that unfortunately we are seeing in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sad to say that today the government and the opposition by seeking to exempt this bill from the cut&hyphen;off or move this bill at all are not only showing blatant disregard for detainees and those refugees whose livelihoods are affected by this crucial piece of legislation, but they are showing contempt for those very human rights watchdogs that I talked about. Not only that but, as Senator Woodley and Senator Bourne have made clear, this bill actually threatens to contradict our rights under international covenants and conventions. That is a worrying trend and I would be curious to find out from the government and the minister what discussions have taken place in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in regard to us dispatching our obligations under some of the relevant international treaties and covenants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should refer specifically to what covenants we are concerned about and why these covenants may be breached, in particular, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. There are other international instruments that apply in the case of this bill and to which we are a party. I can give at least four examples of the provisions of the covenants offended by this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First of all, discrimination against immigration detainees on the basis of their status as <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2552"> unlawful non&hyphen;citizens. That represents a breach of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Secondly, it denies such detainees effective access to legal assistance to challenge the lawfulness of their detention. Again, that is another blatant breach of this instrument to which we are a party. Thirdly, it is inhumane in its treatment of immigration detainees and, lastly, it denies immigration detainees their freedom to receive communications from outside the detention centre. This aspect of the bill is particularly appalling, because the communication from which these detainees are excluded relates to authorities set up to guard against the abuse of human rights in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, today we are seeing an attempt to curtail the powers of those very watchdogs which have been set up to guard against human rights abuses in this country. I note that Senator Spindler provided a dissenting report to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee. I commend him for his report, even though he had to prepare it in such haste. The committee sat for a ridiculously condensed period of time and this parliament has not allowed due scrutiny, discussion or negotiation of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his submission, Senator Spindler points out article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. I think it is appropriate that we remind people in this place today of the actual wording of article 9. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Anyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings before a court, in order that that court may decide without delay on the lawfulness of his detention and order his release if the detention is not lawful.</PARA>
<PARA>We threaten to breach that convention today with the legislation that is before the chamber. In addition, article 10 of that covenant states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All persons deprived of their liberty shall be treated with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not see how this legislation upholds that important principle. I reiterate Senator Spindler's question of the government: is it the intention of this government to detatch Australia from its obligations under these international instruments and treaties? We <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> should be greatly concerned. I also reiterate a plea to members on the opposite side of this chamber that they consider those fundamental civil libertarian principles&mdash;</PARA>

I suspect he would give people on the other sides of the chamber a good telling off. I think he would be absolutely outraged at the debate that is taking place in this place today and would be greatly concerned by the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, he is not the only one. We know that there are senators in this chamber who are not members of the minor parties and who are concerned greatly by the contents of the bill and the attempt to exempt the bill from the cut&hyphen;off motion today. I make a personal plea to those senators to at least consider deferring this bill so that it gets the due consultation and due process that should be afforded this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are people outside this place who are concerned about the contents of this bill, some of whom have been referred to in this debate. Senator Woodley in particular referred to Frank Brennan. I also have received letters from groups such as the Federation of Community Legal Centres. It is worth noting what Liz Curran, the community liaison and project worker for law reform from the Federation of Community Legal Centres says about the bill. She claims that her organisation is concerned about the endeavours by government to reduce avenues for redress of detainees from overseas where human rights abuses may occur. She states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission or ombudsman should be able to investigate claims of human rights abuses against persons in detention without hindrance and without the necessity for a complaint by an individual in detention. In view of the isolation of detainees and the difficulties of communication that they <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2553"> have with the outside world, they will be unable to gain access to the commission and ombudsman by way of individual complaint and so scrutiny of abuses will be a virtual impossibility.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what I and my Democrat colleagues are arguing today is that, apart from the fact there is no financial or other impetus for this bill to be exempt from the cut&hyphen;off, there is a very good reason to defer debate on this bill: the watchdogs I referred to earlier, the Ombudsman's office and Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, have not had sufficient time to consider, debate and discuss the contents of the bill, and to outline a more appropriate outcome to this debate.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2554">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have mentioned other organisations that are willing to be involved in discussion on this matter. They should also have the opportunity for consultation and to be consulted and involved in this debate. I have also referred to the haphazard nature of the committee hearing and discussion that took place the night before last. I think it is shameful that staff were kept working for a continuous period of 36 hours. I am sure that is not a precedent, but it is certainly nonetheless an appalling thing to happen in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is sad that this day, this last day of the Senate sittings, should be marked by the discussion of such a shameful piece of legislation. As I mentioned after last night's debate, it is particularly touching that we are discussing this today but it is also, if we are talking about timing, ironic because this week is Refugees Week. Once again, it is a shameful coincidence. What is the gift we are giving to refugees in this country this week? A piece of legislation that threatens to blatantly contravene our obligations and our commitments under international law. Perhaps one of the submissions on this matter to the joint standing committee put it best when it described the bill as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mean&hyphen;minded, unnecessary, morally untenable, in contravention of Australia's international legal obligations and quite contrary to the traditional Australian ethos of fair play.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is a good enough reason in itself to refuse exemption of this bill from the cut-off motion. There are so many issues in it that deserve further investigation, discussion and consultation. It is indeed mean&hyphen;minded, and in the eyes of the international community we should all be deeply ashamed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, I have heard no convincing reasons, either today or yesterday, as to why this bill is urgent and why it should be pressed ahead with today of all days&mdash;or any day for that matter. No-one has offered a single financial, social, cultural or legal reason for passage of this bill. I think there are many good reasons for this bill to be deferred and further discussed&mdash;for not just those groups I referred to: not just for the human rights watchdogs; not just for those individuals who have complained; not just for <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> those detainees and refugees whose livelihoods are affected by this bill; and not just for the benefit of parliamentarians. What about the departments?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I reiterate my question to this government relating to the role of DFAT in this bill: has the minister signalled to the Australian government and Australian people that we are dispatching those very obligations under international covenants that I referred to? I would like further time for the department to explain. Another reason why this bill is not urgent is that DFAT should be involved in discussions and given explanations as to what is going on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I state our objections once again to this bill being exempt from the cut-off motion. I reiterate our objections to this bill generally. Senator O'Chee, if any of your colleagues or any of our opposition colleagues could provide one decent, humane reason as to why this bill should be exempt or indeed even passed in this chamber, perhaps we would consider this differently. But all I see is a bill that threatens our international obligations. It is a shameful piece of legislation. It should certainly not be exempt from the cut&hyphen;off motion before us today.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are considering the urgency, or lack of urgency, of the Migration Legislation Amendment (No. 2) Bill. I concur with my colleagues who have pointed out that there has been no demonstration from either side of the chamber of any degree of urgency in terms of social, financial or legislative requirements. In many ways it seems that this is an attitude which continues when we examine the chronology of what has already occurred.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wonder how many of those who would like to see this matter considered as urgent have considered the Parliamentary Research Service's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bills Digest</EMPHASIS>. As I understand it, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bills Digest</EMPHASIS> has only recently been completed, but it is a sizeable document which has some <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2555"> 41 end notes. Last night, in what was ostensibly my final speech in this place, I made mention of the sorts of information one should consider if one is to make a proper, informed decision on legislation. I hope that is, after all, what we are trying to do here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The footnotes in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bills Digest</EMPHASIS> point out that there has been a succession of attempts in this matter to legislate away what any reasonable person would consider to be fundamental human rights. Earlier today, mention was also made of Senator Harradine's concerns in this area. I know all honourable senators are concerned with human rights and the proper administration of justice, but Senator Harradine certainly has a long tradition of being wary of any attempts to legislate away those basic rights. He has spoken at length and often, I might say, on this topic. I wonder whether it is a coincidence that he is not in Australia at the moment and thus is unable to contribute. I wonder what his contribution would be to what is now before us in light of what I see as unseemly haste to get this bill before us and out of the way. That is definitely what I see is happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will not stand here and read into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> the entire contents of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bills Digest</EMPHASIS>, but I draw the attention of those who have a genuine interest in this matter to this particular digest because it lists a handful of reasons, each of which is sufficient to justify deeper and further consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been assisted in coming to believe that this is not an urgent matter by my membership of the Senate Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. That committee had great justification for carefully and thoroughly investigating this legislation before it was proceeded with. I am sorry that it is only too seldom that senators take advantage of the considerations of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. The most recent <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Alert Digest</EMPHASIS> would have been made available to senators yesterday, and it contains questions which have been asked of the minister which are yet to be answered. So this matter is before us now without there having been the right and proper opportunity for those questions which have been posed by the Scrutiny of Bills <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Committee to have been addressed and answered by the minister. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee was seeking the minister's advice about a retrospectivity effect, amongst other questions. As a committee, we have ben considering whether there is in fact a denial of access to justice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I notice in his absence that on Senator Cooney's bench there is a growing pile of legal references, each marked with inserts of yellow sticky paper. I do not think he has completed his case yet, but I know that Senator Cooney is working very hard to compile a case to address this particular question. I am not surprised about that because this question of whether there is a denial of access to justice&mdash;which should really concern someone like Senator Cooney, and I hope the entire Senate&mdash;was a question before the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. We are asking senators to consider that. It is the role of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee to consider each and every piece of legislation that comes before us, as well as the terms of reference, and that includes the question of whether access to justice is being denied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We as a committee have considered whether the right to knowledge and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights are compromised. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Alert Digest</EMPHASIS> concludes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the committee draws Senators' attention to the provisions, as they may be considered to trespass unduly on personal rights and liberties, in breach of principle 1(a)(i) of the committee's terms of reference.</PARA>
<PARA>I will not keep the Senate by reading either the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Alert Digest</EMPHASIS>  or the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bills Digest</EMPHASIS> . I suggest that a better way to do it is for senators to be given the time and opportunity to consider both those documents and the response which the Scrutiny of Bills Committee seeks from the minister responsible. We have not had time to do that. None of you has had time to do that. Nobody in this chamber has had time to properly consider the response of the minister, because it has not arrived yet; it is not possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore I submit that this thing is not urgent. As Senator Natasha Stott Despoja so ably demonstrated, there has not been any evidence given to us by any senator which <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2556"> would lead us to conclude otherwise. The fact that there was such an urgent scrabbling of meetings to try to shovel this through further indicates that a little more caution and a lot less haste would be of greater benefit to the legislation.</PARA>

<TIME.STAMP>(1.17 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996. In doing so, I say firstly that there needs to be a sense of priorities&mdash;priorities that have not been focused on by those who are concerned by Australia's record on refugees. I do not think enough people know that our record on refugees is unmatched. We take more refugees per capita into Australia than any other country, and the assistance we give refugees is also unparalleled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important in Refugee Week to put that on the record because, whilst that is the degree of our achievement, whilst we have taken some one million refugees into the country since the end of World War II, there is a bit of a crisis in public support for our refugee program. It is a crisis born of a lack of education or understanding of the issues involved&mdash;a crisis fuelled by prejudice and ignorance in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia does not take refugees just because it is the good and moral thing to do. We should recognise that, through taking refugees, this country over the last 40 or so years has picked up an enormous human resource in the skills, talents, energy and dedication to starting a new life in a new country exhibited by those refugees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the Vietnamese community&mdash;one of the biggest and latest batches of people in need of assistance&mdash;although there are problems with the settlement and composition of that community, within 20 years of migration to this country it is achieving record rates of placement in the work force and in the education system. It is also interesting to note that women are at the forefront of the achievements that community is making in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why, when we benefit so much as a community, when our record is so good in this area, is there little public appreciation of or support for it? One reason is that those who are devoting time, energy, resources and personal endeavour to supporting refugees do not have their voices heard. Too often the debate focuses on those who come here illegally by boat and the time it takes to process them. Not enough time is spent <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2557"> promoting the achievements not only of government but of that community sector which is so critical to the good settlement of people into this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One aspect of this diversion of energy, this lack of promotion of such achievement, is the concern&mdash;in fact, the obsession&mdash;some people have with boat people. You cannot let everyone who comes into Australia by boat stay here. They might have valid claims to make under our system of refugee assessment for humanitarian processing, and in those circumstances they are entitled to stay here. But for the system to work for our migration and refugee programs, benchmarks need to be applied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The benchmark that this country has applied consistently over the decades has been the international definition of `refugee', and the international convention on the treatment of refugees. That is applied onshore and, to a great extent, to the way we assess people offshore. We need a system that is internationally accepted and which, through being internationally accepted, provides equity to those who are in dire need of assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Offshore we work with the UNHCR to identify the areas of need and to identify refugees. That system has worked pretty well. Onshore over recent years we have come a long way, and people in the refugee support sector acknowledge that. We now have an assessment system which provides refugee status for about a third of the people who apply for that status onshore. That is a very a fairly good strike rate when you compare it with other western democracies that have onshore assessment processes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to note that people's applications are processed much more quickly now than they had been over the previous period. It takes some six to seven weeks to get an initial assessment of one's refugee claim. It takes two or three months, for instance, for those who come here by boat to have a merit review at the Refugee Review Tribunal level. So you are talking about three or four months to get both an assessment and an external merit based review by the RRT. Those who find themselves in detention thereafter are those who take advantage of&mdash;it is there to be <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> taken advantage of&mdash;our constitutional system, and through that they have access to the Australian legal system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know the government is trying to see whether it can stop access to the Federal Court for people who get bounced on the RRT level. The advice that we used to get as a government&mdash;the advice given to committees of this parliament&mdash;has been that it would be a short&hyphen;sighted move to try and do that, because, through the original jurisdiction of the High Court, people can find that they have access to the judicial system in any event. In fact, it may take longer to settle cases if the government does do away with the access to the Federal Court&mdash;a mechanism which is in place now and, I must say as well, available only to a limited degree. I must caution the minister in terms of how he proceeds down that route, because whatever you do in migration these days there has to be an eye to how the legal system, the Federal Court and the High Court will determine people's rights in our system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With that sort of backdrop, I think it is important to recognise that equity demands a rigid application of the international covenants that are in place here&mdash;a rigid adherence to our obligations. Our obligations are to entertain applications, our obligations are to entertain them fairly, and our obligations are not only to those who make claims in our system but also to those who are in the queue waiting to come to Australia by way of our humanitarian program. As I said, you have to apply benchmarks, and the international convention is important in terms of a definition of refugee and in terms of how cases are proceeded with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the last couple of years we have made amendments to our legislation to, for instance, ensure that those who had received protection in another country could not go forum shopping. We had great resistance to that measure in this place and in parts of the community. The UNHCR was keen to see that sort of measure in place because it knew that if we allowed forum shopping to the extent that it was starting to happen then those who are in desperate and legitimate need in other parts of the world&mdash;in fact the same region as some <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2558"> of those who have tried forum shopping&mdash;would miss out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to those who have been processed elsewhere, we brought in legislation to ensure that those who have been processed under a fair system elsewhere cannot start the process here again, and the opposition supported us on that when we were in government. Of course, we had, once again, concern from other parties in this place and in the community about what we were doing. What we were doing was essentially saying that those who had a legitimate claim which had not been met elsewhere or which had not been recognised under a fair system elsewhere should not be coming here and starting in the system again. I do not think there is anything fairer than that not only to the international system but also to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same, I think, applies to this particular legislation. You have got to play this game by the rules, and with respect to this particular legislation we have got to acknowledge that when people do come here they do not all say the word `asylum' or `refugee'. Senator Spindler, you should know this because you have had a long interest in this, and I do not want to engage in any acrimonious debate with you on your last day of debate here.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not have a choice. What the opposition says about this is that there is capacity for external assessment of what the department does. There is the capacity for state governments, church groups, UNHCR and Amnesty International to go in there and make an overview. What we are saying is that we do not want a situation where people from outside the centre can go in and ignite claims for asylum status when that is not what is on the people's minds when they come here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have seen records of transcripts when people have come here. I have looked through them closely, and I have noticed that the words `asylum', `in fear of persecution' and those sorts of things do not appear. I am sure if the government was asked from time to time to make available an overview, without names, on a confidential basis, of some of the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> statements people make when they come here, it would be easy for it to do that. It would have been easy to do that before the last election. That is the sort of scrutiny the department has been open to, and the department has been open to scrutiny from Amnesty International, UNHCR, churches and whatever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To make the system work, we cannot afford to allow ourselves to become a soft touch for the bogus claims. I think that is important as background when one makes an assessment of this particular legislation. It is legislation which, the parliament has been advised, is in accordance with our international obligations, and that is an important benchmark as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose, with a degree of frustration, I stand here and support this legislation. I say frustration because not only has the good work of the past been ignored by those who, by promoting it, would actually be able to build on that achievement, but also we are actually engaging in this debate in refugee week at a time when there are serious proposals on the table to reduce our refugee and humanitarian intake by some one-third. Senator Short might argue about the figures here, but whether it is 13,000 or 15,000, or down to 10,000, it is going to be a reduction of either 3,000 or 5,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I implore those in the community sector to focus on that: if you are really concerned about Australia's record on refugee protection and our good standing in the international community, look at that particular aspect and try to engender some community and concern about that. That community debate and concern will only stick if the community understands the value of the programs in place, not just to the individuals involved but to Australian society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the amount of energy spent in the past couple of weeks on this particular bill&mdash;which, I would argue, has been misplaced&mdash;had been spent on trying to turn the debate around on just this coming year's intake in the humanitarian program, then maybe we would be able to help a few more people in dire need to come to this country. Maybe we would be able to raise awareness and help a lot more people come here from Indochina, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2559"> the Middle East, the former Yugoslavia or Africa. It is a dereliction of responsibilities by those who, though genuine, take an interest in this but have redirected their resources at a critical time in this debate away from the annual humanitarian program to focus on this particular issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am concerned at what is happening in that program. I am concerned that a reduction is on the horizon. I am also concerned at suggestions that maybe the program will be modified in such a way that it will allow our onshore intake through our processing system to be included as part of our overall humanitarian program. The numbers that we have taken into Australia, the 13,000&hyphen;14,000&hyphen;15,000 I mentioned earlier, are assessed offshore for humanitarian entry into this country. At the same time as taking that large number of people per capita, we also have got to a situation where some 3,000 people a year are assessed onshore as being entitled to protection as asylum seekers. It used to be some 500 or 600 before we started the independent system some three years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be, I think, scandalous if the government were to include in their figure on the humanitarian program those who have been assessed within Australia. That program is there to cater for those assessed offshore, not onshore. It would be a sleight of hand to include 3,000 cases assessed onshore as part of an overall humanitarian program. Basically, the government would be decreasing our commitment to international humanitarian programs by a sleight of hand which would substantially cut back the program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other aspect of the current discussions that I am concerned about and that the debate should focus on is the special assistance category program. It is an important program that helps those who, although not refugees, are in need of assistance. Their lives have been truncated. They have been through some difficulty in non&hyphen;humanitarian circumstances and they have relatives in Australia. That works as a very important complementary program to the refugee program, as of course does the special humanitarian program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be a big mistake if the government were to carve up that program. It is a very <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cost&hyphen;effective program which allows us to meet our international responsibilities and to build on them but, at the same time, tap into the resources of those within our community, the families, friends and, sometimes, community based organisations, to assist those in difficult circumstances to come here. It has been an invaluable program, for instance, for people from East Timor, Vietnam, Cambodia and other parts of the world. That program needs to be protected as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us focus on what we can do for refugees. Let us focus on recognising that what we are doing here is within our international obligation. Let us focus on a fair system and recognise that. Let us not put Australia down all the time&mdash;which, in essence, has been happening in this area. Internationally, we are recognised for having a pretty fair system.</PARA>

<TIME.STAMP>(1.36 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For a while I thought there would not be very much that I could agree with on what Senator Bolkus was putting before the chamber&mdash;until he suggested that we should review the number of refugees that Australia is prepared to take. In response to some murmurings by the government that they might cut that back, I certainly agree with the need to assess what we can do and to leave the intake at the number of refugees that we now take.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a relatively affluent society, I believe that we have a responsibility to hold out a helping hand to those that are in need. While the argument about the total number of intake will rage backwards and forwards, the Australian Democrats have always put the refugee intake as one of their priorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, I agreed with Senator Bolkus when he said that the special assistance program is a useful and cost effective program. More than that, it is an essential program which assists in the resettlement of migrants coming to this country. Once again, I make this warning: the other organisations&mdash;the non-government organisations and social welfare organisations&mdash;will have to bear the brunt of this measure if it proceeds. Many people could finish up on the streets and homeless, and the suicide rates and illness that we experience could increase. That is what we experience whenever there is a dysfunction in our society and whenever a large number of people are neglected by whichever government is in power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, when Senator Bolkus spoke about a crisis, he left me wondering where the crisis was. Does 700, 800 or maybe 1,200 asylum seekers mean there is a crisis? Should we really be afraid to be flooded by that number of people? Are we so afraid that we are prepared to disregard one of the basic principles&mdash;namely, that someone on our soil who is considering going before an Australian court is entitled to know whether or not he or she has a chance to succeed and what rules govern the particular situation? Are we really saying that we are facing a crisis or a flood <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and are therefore prepared to forgo one of the cornerstones of our system of legal government&mdash;the rule of law?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that this country has, amongst its many assets&mdash;perhaps as its foremost asset&mdash;the rule of law. Every citizen can go before a court and challenge the government and challenge those stronger than themselves. This actually distinguishes us from a society where people are ruled by the executive government at will&mdash;in other words, by a tyranny. Surely we have plenty of examples of that. Indeed, many of the refugees who are reaching our shores have come from countries like that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite a few years ago, I came to Australia from Europe. When I was in Europe, for a number of years during my childhood I experienced conditions that I was glad to escape and I am glad I do not have to experience again. Hopefully, my children will not have to experience them. That is why I value and try to guard jealously the rule of law in this country. I believe that is the hallmark of a civilised society. We all crave that protection&mdash;the protection of being secure and of not finding somebody knocking on your door at midnight saying, `Come with me.' We want to be free and secure and, for that, we need the rule of law. Once we start saying that principles do not matter and that the cost of some court cases is more important than the principle of providing information on people's legal rights, then I believe we have started to dismantle the rule of law. I will come back to that issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Bolkus also harked back to a previous debate which said that, in determining whether or not a person is a refugee, we should accept under the comprehensive plan of action the judgment made by other nations&mdash;that we should trust what is being done in the Philippines, in Indonesia and in other countries, where legal issues are not handled in quite the same way as they are in Australia. We all know they are handled differently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is evidence, for instance, about corruption at the refugee camp in Galang. People are being bribed, but we are supposed to disregard that and as an independent, sovereign nation say, `We will accept the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2561"> judgment of a legal system that has been shown to be corrupt.' That just shows to what extent some of the senators in this place are prepared to compromise the principles I would have thought they held dear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the main question we are dealing with&mdash;the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996&mdash;I want to say that I really wonder how the normally civil libertarian convictions of the socialist left of the Labor Party can reconcile their position and deny people information on their legal rights. They are the principles that they have professed to hold dear. For that matter, I would ask this question of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock): how can a Liberal, a person who professes to hold dear the principles of civil liberties, decide that we should save a few dollars but give up the principle of providing information on a person's legal rights?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats believe that the minister should accept the offers made by the Human Rights Commissioner and the ombudsman for them to handle complaints made under their respective acts until 20 September 1996&mdash;as if the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) had been passed in its present form&mdash;and ensure that there is an amendment to the bill so that the offer can be given effect. I would have thought that was a useful suggestion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If that procedure is not acceptable, we can simply put a three&hyphen;month sunset clause in the bill. That would make sure the bill comes back to parliament after further thought has been given to this very weighty issue which has quite significant consequences. I understand that, so far, the minister has decided not to move in that direction, and that is very regrettable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are dealing with here is an organisation in Australia that has been charged with being the watchdog over human rights, the Human Rights Commission, and the Ombudsman, who is charged with the duty to check government action and to be available to citizens who cannot obtain justice in any other way. They have been charged with watching over the level of human rights that this country is able to maintain but they will <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> be prevented by this bill from providing information on people who are seeking asylum and who have been detained until their refugee status is decided one way or the other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of very disturbing aspects of this bill. Many of these have been raised in the Scrutiny of Bills Committee report which was tabled in the Senate on Wednesday 26 June. Notwithstanding the unanimous decision by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, there are some significant dimensions of Australia's obligations as an international citizen, particularly as they pertain to the adherence to this nation's obligations under the various international human rights instruments which should be taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia, unlike many of its neighbours, ostensibly treats human rights as a national priority. Governments in this country, of all political persuasions, in international fora have championed the cause of human rights. The work of the former Prime Minister Mr Malcolm Fraser regarding the system of apartheid in South Africa immediately springs to mind. It is therefore with more than a passing glimpse that the international community looks at Australia's domestic scene to ascertain whether we practise what we preach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this decade alone we have had cause to be embarrassed internationally by a less than glowing record on domestic human rights standards. Immediate examples include the Toonen v. Australia case before the United Nations Human Rights Committee and the disgraceful record of Aboriginal health and deaths in custody. It is ultimately an issue of national and international credibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Human rights instruments, in any case, are minimum standards. They do not bestow superior treatment on those they are designed to protect. They exhibit very minimal benchmarks that members of the human race should enjoy as part of their inalienable rights. Increasingly, however, it is becoming necessary to apply those standards to people who are marginalised, dispossessed or in some other way forced to the fringes of human existence. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2562">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Australia, the issue is recognised as being of such importance that we have created a statutory supervisory body, as I have said, known as the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. Along with non&hyphen;government organisations such as Amnesty International and the International Commission of Jurists, the Human Rights Commission provides additional checks and balances on governments, which serve to enhance our standing as a free and democratic society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is, therefore, with much suspicion that we should look at attempts to legislatively curtail the Human Rights Commission's jurisdiction and capacity to act. The deprivation of a person's liberty by a state is a matter of international concern. One needs only to read the volumes of cases reported by Amnesty International and the abstract sorrow they entail to get an appreciation of how important a person's liberty is. The recent examples of Aung San Suu Kyi in Burma and President Mandela in South Africa are highly salient, showing how tyranny can prosper simply by locking people up when governments determine that those people are undesirable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is therefore against tyranny that international instruments such as the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment, and the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners seek to regulate acceptable boundaries in the exercise of legislative, executive and even judicial power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clear that, should the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) become law, Australia will be in breach of its international obligations. These are not my assertions but those of the Human Rights Committee in Geneva. Article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Anyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings before a court, in order that that court may decide without delay on the lawfulness of his detention and order his release if the detention is not lawful.</PARA>
<PARA>In general comment No. 8, the Human Rights Committee, whose decision in the Toonen case prompted the Australian government to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> introduce the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Act 1995, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Article 9 which deals with the right to liberty and security of persons has often been somewhat narrowly understood in reports by state parties, and they have therefore given incomplete information. The committee points out that paragraph 1 is applicable to all deprivations of liberty, whether in criminal cases or in other cases such as, for example, mental illness, vagrancy, drug addiction, educational purposes, immigration control&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I continue the quote:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" RIGHT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is true that some of the provisions of article 9 . . . are only applicable to persons against whom criminal charges are brought, but the rest, and in particular the important guarantee laid down in paragraph 4, i.e. the right to control by a court of the legality of the detention, applies to all persons deprived of their liberty by arrest or detention.</PARA>
<PARA>In addition, article 10 of the ICCPR states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All persons deprived of their liberty shall be treated with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>With regards to article 10, the committee also said that there must be concrete measures taken by `competent authorities to monitor the effective application of the rules regarding the treatment of persons deprived of their liberty' and that arrested or detained persons should know these rules and should have access to effective legal means enabling them to ensure that those rules are respected, to complain if the rules are ignored and to obtain adequate compensation in the event of a violation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite apart from those international instruments mentioned, there is also serious consideration which needs to be made concerning the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment, and the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners. If it is the intention of the government to relieve Australia from its obligations under these instruments, then that provision should be included in the bill. Then at least we would be honest about it. Then we would know that we are prepared to abrogate that this government and this Labor Party are <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2563"> prepared to remove our obligations under international human rights covenants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, there are certain protocols which need to be followed before a nation can withdraw from treaties and covenants which it enters into. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which was not called before the committee to give evidence the other night, nevertheless, must remain in the realms of conjecture as to whether the government has that intention. I understand that it has some concerns about how other countries are going to view our actions if we proceed with this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this parliament enacts this bill, we will have taken a very critical step that this nation and this parliament may well regret in the future because we are doing no more and no less than denying our human rights obligations and the rule of law in this country, which should be available to every person on Australian soil within the jurisdiction of our courts. To say that we are prepared to simply cast these considerations aside because it is inconvenient and because we do not want to engage in the very often costly process of allowing these people to challenge in court decisions that are made by government departments, then I believe we are denying a very critical principle on which this nation and the way we are governed depends.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe we will rue the day if we give up our principles for such considerations, which in any case appear to me to be insubstantial. A few hundred refugees are called a flood and a few hundred refugees cause a crisis, and for that we are prepared to give up our principles? No, the Democrats say.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate has before it yet another migration bill, the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996, concerning the treatment of asylum seekers in this country, the boat people, those who came believing that in Australia the rights, freedoms and legal standing of people are respected more than in their own countries. I am not quite sure how many times during my four years in this place the Senate has amended the Migration Act in relation to refugee and asylum seekers. At least four come to mind, but I think it may be more. Senator Spindler assures me it has been more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As has happened on more than one previous occasion, this bill is in response to a court case which the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs lost. The substance of the bill relates to the right of unauthorised boat arrivals to have access to legal advice. It seeks to alter section 193 of the act to make explicit the actions which are not required of an officer of the department in relation to a person in immigration detention and to reverse the decision in the Federal Court that the human rights and equal opportunity act has priority over the Migration Act. The bill also seeks to amend section 256 of the Migration Act to make explicit the right of a person in detention to request visa application forms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill echoes a bill from the previous government which included the bizarre wording that `not even a court may order the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2564"> person's release'&mdash;that is, from immigration detention. We must remember that this is not supposed to be custody. It is custody in every sense of word, but, as Senator McKiernan has often said in this place, these people that have fled and arrived in boats, often in very traumatic conditions, are free to leave and go back to where they came from. It is nonetheless detention and it is nonetheless bizarre that not even a court may order a person's release from that detention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill now before the Senate takes this thinking a step further by seeking to remove the protection of the common law from section 193. Furthermore, the bill seeks to make the ability to create written submissions to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission or the ombudsman a mandatory part of every asylum seeker's curriculum vitae. I refer to the proposed wording of new section 193 (3).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In light of answers to my questions about the decrease in the ombudsman's budget and the likely reduction in the number of complaints the ombudsman is able to investigate, this section may prove to be an even bigger stumbling block to applicants for refugee status than it appears to be on the surface&mdash;goodness knows it is bad enough already. I issued a press release entitled `Is accountability a one&hyphen;way street?', which deals with the funding cut for the Commonwealth ombudsman's office. I did that because I wanted to say that we seem to be quite happy about using the slogan of accountability to justify enormous policy changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One example is ATSIC funding. However, when it comes to the government being accountable and funding properly the accountability mechanisms that are available to ordinary citizens to challenge government departments, such as the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, the funding is being cut by 16 per cent. The complaints that can be dealt with are likely to drop below 50 per cent simply because of the cuts to the funding and the probable drop in staffing levels. There will be certain difficulties in addressing very important inquiries such as the NOMAD crash and the ATSIC Burnt Bridge inquiry.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have, on one hand, a government that is saying accountability is very important yet, on the other hand, its accountability to the people and the accountability of government departments does not seem important. I think we should remember that. The Human Rights Commissioner&mdash;I might add that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission is suffering in the same way as the Commonwealth ombudsman's office is in terms of funding cuts&mdash;Mr Chris Sidoti, held a media conference about this legislation last week. I am sorry I was not able to be there as it must have been very powerful. Mr Sidoti reminded those present of some of the words of the Australian national anthem:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For those who've come across the seas</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We've boundless plains to share</PARA>
<PARA>I thought that was very interesting because I had been to the memorial at St Christopher's in Manuka for those who died in the tragic Black Hawk accident. We sang both verses of the national anthem. It is unusual to sing both verses. I was choked with emotion on that occasion and I nearly choked when I was reminded of the second verse of Australia's national anthem. I think it would do my colleagues in the chamber who are planning to support&mdash;</PARA>

Our colleagues in the chamber should be aware that when we sing our national anthem we are actually giving the lie to the kind of attitude it represents. When we present legislation in this chamber we try to push it through in the space of one week and we do it by dint of numbers by both major parties voting together.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For those who've come across the seas</PARA>

<PARA>Mr Sidoti also drew attention to some statistics about people who have applied for and been granted refugee status in recent years. Up to June 1994, 856 people arrived by boat unauthorised, of whom 394 were granted <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2565"> residency&mdash;that is, 46 per cent. From July 1994, 1,622 people have arrived, of whom only 78 or 4.8 per cent have been granted residency. How can this be? The refugee application process did not suddenly change in July 1994. The definition of a convention refugee did not change. Australia did not withdraw its status as a party to the refugee convention. What then happened?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The evidence points to only one conclusion, and if I may use biblical language to describe the change, the government hardens its heart against the asylum seekers. Sadly, the change was made with the support of both major parties in the parliament and hence we do not anticipate a more humane approach with the new government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1994 the coalition did develop a conscience and heart in relation to these matters. It was a wonderful occasion when they refused to vote for retrospective legislation to do a dollar a day compensation for illegal detention. I may be wrong about the details, but I do know that the coalition actually stopped the bipartisan inhumanity of its immigration policy over the last four years that I have been in this place. Unfortunately, because there was the potential for that bill being used as a double dissolution trigger they reneged and went back to their current position. Now in government, regrettably, they seem to be firming up their stance. I only hope that this is not the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Throughout the sordid history of Australia's response to the boat arrivals since 1989, the government has worked extremely hard to turn public opinion in favour of its harsh and unfeeling policy. As I have pointed out on numerous occasions, this is in marked contrast to the climate of welcome created by the Fraser government in the aftermath of the Vietnam War when far greater numbers of people arrived by boat than are doing so at present.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also think both major parties were attuned to the political nature of criticisms in the community. In relation to the gun control laws they have stuck true to principle, they have not been swayed by loudness of voices and they have listened to the silent majority; whereas in relation to immigration policy they <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are determined to listen to the loudest and strident voices. They have turned a deaf ear to the silent majority&mdash;the compassionate and caring citizens of Australia who would not wish to violate anybody's human rights or ill&hyphen;treat people who arrive on our shores, who would want fair and just processes to be available to everybody in this country. As I was saying, during the Fraser government far greater numbers of people arrived by boat and there was a compassionate response from the government of that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The community has been bombarded with government statements that the boat people are queue jumpers, that they are the victims of unscrupulous entrepreneurs in other countries who are making money by providing boats, that they are being used by touting lawyers who want to make money out of the misery of others, and that they are not refugees anyway. Let us look at those arguments. If people who arrive by boat are queue jumpers, then it is high time the refugee convention was rewritten, because the convention describes as a refugee a person who is outside their home country and is unable or unwilling to accept the protection of their own country. I have often wondered where the queue is. It must be a very long queue by now, as there are upwards of 25 million refugees around the world according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about the unscrupulous boat providers? Certainly, people are reported to have paid large sums of money to get a place on a boat. That presumably implies that someone is getting rich from this trade in uncertainty. But what does that have to do with Australia's obligations to assess their claims for refugee status? What about the touting lawyers? As Mr Sidoti pointed out in his communication to me, there are many lawyers in this country who have jeopardised their financial wellbeing through their willingness to take on the cases of asylum seekers on a pro bono basis. They have shown precisely what the phrase `pro bono' should mean: work for the good; work for the good of the community. I commend the many lawyers I have seen who have taken on very heavy and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2566"> traumatic case loads because of what they have to contend with.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also informed that at present there are only three boat people cases before the Refugee Review Tribunal and 70 cases subject to litigation. That is hardly a picture of masses of lawyers running around the country propping up their practices by taking on boat people as clients. When they are not even paying, I think that is a very long bow to draw.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, the government argues that these people are not refugees. The usual lines are that they are economic refugees&mdash;whatever that may mean&mdash;or that they are simply trying to improve their economic lot and are not refugees of any description. They must be rather like the early settlers, if this definition is supported. They must be like our ancestors who arrived on these shores. Apparently it was okay in those days for them to be so&hyphen;called economic refugees who were seeking to improve their economic lot.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have to bear in mind is that asylum seekers do not label themselves with a little badge before they leave their home country. They do not say, `I am an asylum seeker.' They flee for their lives. They do it in secrecy, and they might use all their financial means to try to secure passage on a boat. When they arrive on our shores and see <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people in uniform, are we really entitled to assume that they will say, `Ah, a wonderful department of immigration officer whom I can trust immediately with the stories of my persecution back home, even though I can't speak his language and I don't know who this person is.' That is the problem we have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We really do not know that the communication is there for us to assess whether they have the capacity to know whom to speak to and what words to say. To define them as economic refugees because of their phrasing or because of the way they seek to express their reasons for being here in response to questions that they may or may not understand and implications that they certainly do not understand is another matter. No-one is arguing that everyone who seeks refugee status will be granted protection, but the refugee convention makes it abundantly clear that the question of whether a person is a refugee can be answered only in terms of the individual case. Blanket decisions are not possible where refugees are concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At times the previous government sought ways to overcome that requirement&mdash;for instance, with the decision to sign a safe third country regulation pertaining to Sino-Vietnamese in China. That was one of the decisions I forgot when mentioning the numbers of disgraceful pieces of legislation that have come into this place. That move was one of the more reprehensible steps along this long and sorry road, because it ruled out whole categories of people who might seek asylum here while still upholding the need for individuals in other groups to prove their case for protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However the government might like to paint the picture, the fact remains that there are refugees among those who arrive without authorisation&mdash;whether they are 4.6 per cent or 46 per cent. The record proves that 46 per cent of boat arrivals who came before July 1994 were granted refugee status. They were found to be refugees. Even after the hardening of the government heart in July 1994, people have been granted refugee status. Even under the grudging, miserly system which now prevails, people are being recognised as <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2567"> refugees. So now we have more legislation to change the rules.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rules being changed now are an attack on fundamental human rights for everyone in this country. This legislation strikes at the heart of this country's human rights structures. If the parliament is prepared to countenance this change, it demonstrates an extremely worrying trend in the way this country values the rights and freedoms of individuals. The bill seeks to make sure that no&hyphen;one will be able to volunteer information about legal advice and protection visa applications to people in immigration detention. Not only will no&hyphen;one be able to; the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commissioner is not allowed to and the Commonwealth ombudsman is not allowed to volunteer information about legal advice and protection visa applications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People so being held are to be entirely on their own. We are asked to pass a bill which contains a provision which, if it were not so serious, would be funny. It is a laughable situation, except that it is an extremely black, tragic comedy. Proposed new section 193(3) proposes that the government may deny legal advice and other information to an asylum seeker unless the asylum seeker makes a written complaint to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission or to the Ombudsman. The mental image is staggering. A boatload of people arrive on the north&hyphen;west coast of Australia. The people are picked up and transported to Port Hedland detention centre. Of course, the first thing they will do is ask for pen and paper so that they can write a complaint. No doubt, they will even ask for stamps and we could just about anticipate that future legislation will make explicit that asylum seekers are entitled to stamps.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The irony of that is this: I wonder how many senators think that people arriving from another country&mdash;probably one with an authoritarian government, possibly with a corrupt local bureaucracy&mdash;will think their way through the arcane provisions of Australian migration legislation and realise that they will need to write such a complaint. We also ask whether English is their language and whether they can write in English. Is that the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> picture? If they do not have to write this letter to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commissioner in English, I wonder what the name is for the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commissioner in every language from which asylum seekers come. Maybe we should provide that information in the legislation too&mdash;that they have to use the right name. Is that the picture that the parliament wants the world to have of Australia's commitment to human rights?</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It puts me in mind of some of the more bizarre experiences one reads about when people come into contact with bureaucracy. One of my staff was once asked to prove that he had not applied for a sales tax rebate on a car he was taking out of the country. I ask honourable senators to ponder the likelihood that a person, with no assistance from the management or staff or the detention centre, with no access to legal advice, is going to arrive at the conclusion that they have to write to another part of the bureaucracy to raise a complaint so that they can then have access to legal advice?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This government, like its predecessor, has already argued that `we need to have control over our migration program' and we cannot have people arriving without authorisation. Fine, but what about the exceptions which exist?</PARA>

What about the discussion about allowing tourists from certain countries to come in visa-free?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Why is it that when business is involved, mountains of obstacles can move aside, but when the human rights of boat people are concerned, mountains of obstacles are built up, and piled one on another if people discover that the mountain can be climbed?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This legislation demonstrates yet again just how fragile the human rights structure in Australia is. It can be swept aside whenever human rights become a nuisance to government. In this case, the govern <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2568"> ment has decided that even the protection given to people under the common law is a nuisance, and so it is writing the common law out of Section 193 of the act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think it was Senator Bourne, during the debate on exempting this bill from the `cut off order', who pointed out that this bill seeks to make it as difficult as is human possible, for an asylum seekers to get the information necessary to gain access to that human rights protection which Australia is so proud of in international circles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Last Friday night a Sino-Vietnamese couple with a severely disabled baby was deported from Port Hedland. It was a disgraceful episode which demonstrates in the starkest terms possible the heartlessness of this country's refugee process. The department received an opinion from a specialist at the Division of Molecular Medicine of the John Curtin School of Medical Research that, considering the lack of appropriate medical care available in China, sending this child back is a de facto death sentence. The couple were denied access to the chaplain of the detention centre before they were put in a paddy wagon and taken to the plane.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is this how Australia wants to be known around the world?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Human rights, of course, are in the eye of the beholder. This country provides military training to members of the Indonesian armed forces, who then use that training when they deal with people in East Timor, in Aceh and in Irian Jaya. The previous government told us that one of the reasons for providing such training was so that the attitude to human rights of the Australian military would `rub off' on to the Indonesians. This is, of course, a process of osmosis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But osmosis is a two way process, and in recent times we have become concerned that more of the Indonesian attitude is rubbing off than the other way around. For instance, when protesters in Australia burnt Indonesian flags last year, the then Minister for Defence, Senator Ray, instantly argued for laws banning burning flags. That is the sort of response to protest that you would expect from a closely controlled society like Indonesia, not an open and free society like Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe that Australia's refugee assessment process is starting to look like the sort of process that one would expect to find in a country which is not a signatory to the Refugee Convention. It looks like the process of osmosis is working to water down the commitment to human rights in this country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the Development Allowance Authority Amendment Bill. The opposition disagrees to this motion. This is the third time the bill has been back here. It is the third time the government has had an opportunity to do the right thing by the people of Australia and it is the third time that the government has declined to do it. It knows the mood of the Senate. It could have had no stronger statement on this subject than that by the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Cheryl Kernot, who, I freely acknowledge, was the first senator in this chamber to move the amendment, which we supported, and which the Greens supported, to the Development Allowance Authority Amendment Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The course the government has chosen is one of confrontation. This is a confrontation by the government of the Senate. The Senate has expressed its view twice in an articulate, detailed way, going carefully through all of the arguments, which are well known. For the government to walk back in and say, `We put your arguments at naught. We take no notice of you. Just do as we say and carry this bill' is not a way in which the business of government should be conducted in this country and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2569"> it is not something with which the opposition agrees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems that the government is, despite all that, fixed on its course, which is one of intimidation. It is threatening that there is $2.5 billion worth&mdash;as it keeps rehearsing its mantra&mdash;of some 40 projects around Australia held up by the amendment put by the opposition, Greens and Democrats. That is nonsense. It is the government's choice that that is the case; it is no&hyphen;one else's decision. We have supported this bill all the way through. In fact, when we were in government we originated this bill. It is our bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a bill that the opposition and now the minister representing the government opposed at the time it came on before. But we have been through this argument. They opposed it for political reasons when they were in opposition. Now that they are in government they see the merit of the proposal&mdash;and we have voted for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats have moved an amendment relating to urban road development in Australia beyond 15 December 1995. It is that one amendment, and only that, which is in dispute. The government has said, `Because you disagree with that bit, the whole lot goes. Therefore, you, the opposition, and you, the Democrats, and you, the Greens, take responsibility for the $2.5 billion worth of investment that could arise around Australia.' What utter nonsense! We are the ones who have promoted that investment. If for political reasons the government wants to hold hostage the $2.5 billion worth of investment in 40 projects around Australia to try to thump this chamber into submission and into agreeing with their position on urban road developments in Australia post&hyphen;15 December 1995, then be it on the government's head.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No amount of blustering by the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Short, either now or in question time&mdash;as was the case earlier this week when he attacked the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Kernot, and called her a saboteur of these projects&mdash;amounts to anything because that is just a political pose by the government. No amount of bluster by the Minister for Transport and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Regional Development, Mr Sharp, amounts to anything.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In an extraordinary and over&hyphen;the&hyphen;top statement to the media yesterday, Mr Sharp said that Senator Kernot will be responsible for deaths on Australian roads because tollways may not be built. I think that is over the top. We gave Senator Short an opportunity here to moderate those remarks and to do the decent thing this last day of the parliamentary sittings so we could all go to the break with a sense of respect between one another and a bit of a convivial ending to the session, and he declined to do so. Those remarks remain on the record. What ridiculousness!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has also accused us, the opposition, of doing one thing and saying another. The last time we debated this here I had entered into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of this parliament a press release of December last year by the then Treasurer, Mr Ralph Willis, and the then Minister for Transport, Mr Laurie Brereton, saying that these freeways post&hyphen;15 December were not supported by the Labor government at the time&mdash;and now that we are in opposition we still do not support them. We have not changed our view despite our transfer from the government benches to the opposition benches.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our view remains consistent, yet we have this parroting and repetition that somehow our view has changed. Then we have the odd and weird situation where the minister is saying&mdash;and I am paraphrasing him; I know this is silly but it is what he said&mdash;that, on the one hand, our position was never to do this when we were in government; the fact is, of course, course that it was&mdash;but then, on the other hand, we did it only because the Premier of New South Wales, Bob Carr, made us do it, or we had a blue with him about it and we did it. You cannot have both positions simultaneously because there is a logical inconsistency between them. In any case, despite the misrepresentation by the government, our position was made clear on 15 December in a press release issued by the then Treasurer and then transport minister, and we are being consistent with that now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not need to go back through all of the other arguments. We have had them many <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2570"> other times. I simply refer people to this morning's debate in which I again took my time to go through the arguments very carefully to set them out, so they are on the record. I refer anyone reading the record at this point back to that debate. The other arguments related, of course, to the Economic Planning Advisory Council's private infrastructure task force report and also to the government's own Commission of Audit report, which criticised taxation concessions in this area as inefficient and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am just exasperated by this. If the government is not prepared to listen to a moderate, reasonable, considered and a balanced view from this chamber and insists on trying to intimidate it, I think the sensible thing for us to do is just stick by our position. Our position is an appropriate and proper one anyway, and that is where we stand. It is for the government to do the decent thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government wants to hold hostage $2.5 billion worth of investment in 40 projects around Australia, that is its choice. But not one&mdash;and I warn the government of this&mdash;of those 40 projects will thank them for doing it, because they will see immediately through the transparency of this ruse. It is just simply a ploy, and they will see that and they will know who is to blame. They will, as quickly as they can be, in the front door of all ministers' offices arguing, `Why don't you let ours through?' That is what they will be arguing. I have sat there as a minister and seen it all before. When they come and talk to us, as they always do, what will we be saying? We will be saying, `Yes, we want yours to go through, and the only obstacle is the government. It is an artificially created obstacle to try to create a political debate which does not exist. Therefore, they are responsible.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So whatever short-term politics is being played here&mdash;and there is no pun intended, Senator Short&mdash;they are exceedingly short term. They will not last beyond the first couple of days, I can promise you. I therefore urge you, even at this late and last hour despite how fixed, how narrow&hyphen;minded, how trenchant and how determined you are to monster us on this occasion&mdash;and understand <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that it just will not work; let me say that moderately: it will not work&mdash;that the smartest thing you can do is fold up your tent and go quietly on this occasion.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is interesting that the government has chosen to bring this matter back to the Senate. It is also very interesting to me that they had to wheel out the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) to speak on this matter just a short time ago in the House of Representatives. We all need to remember that this is the same Treasurer who said that the tax system cannot be riddled and rorted and who pursued the state premiers with the sales tax exemptions. What is his first major tax policy announcement? It is to open up a new rort on roads.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was interesting to see the Minister for Finance intervene. This is the same Mr John Fahey who, in his former role as Premier of New South Wales, negotiated the deals that underpinned the M4, M5 and, especially, the M2 motorway proposals. This is the same Mr John Fahey who signed off on that deal. What is he doing now? He is now standing up, defending the tax rort that made it all possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wonder if Mr Fahey has read the report by former Australian Stock Exchange and Shareholders' Association executive Mr Dick Tanter on the M2. Mr Tanter concluded that the prospectus for the M2 project deliberately hides losses likely on the project, and that the superannuation funds which invested in the project could face severe losses as a result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Fahey authorised subsidies of $76.5 million from the New South Wales government to the M2 project. That was on top of the infrastructure bonds concession from the federal government. That is Mr Fahey's interest in this issue. It was very interesting to see him join in the debate this afternoon. I wonder if New South Wales Liberals like the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) have taken the time to investigate the questions raised by former Independent federal member of parliament Mr Ted Mack about the structuring and prospectus of the M2 tollway project and the lack of attention by the Australian Securities <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2571"> Commission and the ISC in protecting investors in these projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why did the government decide at this time to reinstate this rort? We know that, despite the posturing of the New South Wales opposition, the New South Wales government is relaxed about whether the tax concession is available because the eastern distributor negotiations will go on regardless. We know that the government chose to ignore the advice of their own independent Commission of Audit last week which called for a review of the borrowing concessions, arguing that it was unnecessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Costello has not today or at any other time in this debate given a coherent set of reasons for this concession being reintroduced. All he did was try to sidetrack the argument by deflecting it onto comments about the behaviour of members of the ALP in Victoria. He did not give a coherent rationale for its reintroduction now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is it because there is increasing confidence among the Victorian public transport campaigners that the City Link project might not be eligible for the concessions after all because of Premier Jeff Kennett's little gift of closing down public roads to corral traffic onto City Link? Is it because that breaches the competitive neutrality requirements for the concession? Is it that Treasurer Costello has been advised that City Link might need to reapply? Could that be the explanation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One thing I do know is that the eastern distributor can proceed without the concession. If the New South Wales and federal governments take the advice of EPAC and fund the project by public borrowings outside Loan Council limits, it could be done at much lower cost with far greater public benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The New South Wales government has told my office that they will proceed to call tenders and will announce tenders for the distributor on the basis of whatever policy is decided by Canberra. I cannot believe that Treasurer Costello is prepared to hold those 40 applications for the development allowance out on a limb just to defend this outrageous rort. That is what he is doing; that is the choice he is making. I say this to Mr Costello: you are the one talking about a tight <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> budgetary situation. It is absolutely hypocritical for you to be reinstating tax rorts to the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If Mr Costello is not prepared to close this rort today, next session I will move to amend his next taxation amendment bill in order to remove the concession. We will keep doing that until we get rid of this rort. It is a rort that the financial sector is obviously greatly attached to but it is Mr Costello's duty as Treasurer&mdash;he is the one who said it&mdash;to make sure that the tax system is not riddled and rorted.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government will not change its position on this important matter. Through their actions in relation to this bill, the Labor Party, the Australian Democrats and the Greens have effectively posed a major threat to $2.5 billion of vital investment in development projects in Australia. That $2.5 billion is the estimated value of no less than 40 projects, which will be unable to access the development allowance provided under the Development Allowance Authority Act 1992. They have opposed it for technical reasons, which this bill in simple terms was designed to amend.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The composition of the 40 projects is as follows: 18 in the mining industry, 10 in the tourism industry, six in electricity and gas, four in manufacturing, and three in transport and storage. Those projects are spread throughout Australia, with the mining projects concentrated in Western Australia, Queensland and New South Wales. Development in all states will be set back. This will happen at a time when all thinking Australians are wanting a better life as well as jobs and security for themselves and their children. We need to encourage investment in this country, not hinder it, as Labor, the Democrats and the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2572"> Greens will by their rogue, unprincipled actions in respect of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment that Senator Kernot moved, which Labor and the Greens supported, means the virtual effective destruction of the bill. It was a very deliberate act. It was known by Senator Kernot that the amendment had nothing to do with the bill before the House. The primary purpose of the bill as originally proposed was to amend the principal act to remove certain restrictions on the restructuring of ownership of projects eligible for the development allowance. At the moment, 40 projects will be affected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments to the bill seek to change eligibility for another investment incentive&mdash;infrastructure borrowings. The amendments stem from a narrow concern about the use of infrastructure borrowing to support the private provision of urban roads. It is a very narrow concern for ideological reasons more than anything else, as I interpret the actions of Labor, the Democrats and the Greens. It is for ideological reasons that this amendment has been moved by the Democrats and supported by the Greens and Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The concerns raised, which in our view are misplaced, could equally apply to private investment in other types of public infrastructure. It is simply not appropriate to delay this very important legislation because of these concerns. Instead, if Senator Kernot and others have concerns along the lines that they have indicated in this debate, they should be debated and dealt with in their own right and not used to jeopardise the ability of projects to take up the development allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The concerns raised reflect the arrangements in place for projects developed in the early 1990s. Evidence from more recent projects shows that the involvement of the private sector has generated considerable benefits. For example, construction costs for the private sector, in the case of the M2, are $80 million less than those of the public sector. There has been the transfer of significant risks from the government to the private sector in the case of City Link. Infrastructure borrowings do not result in any significant amount of revenue forgone, as the borrower pays the tax that would otherwise be paid by <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the lender. Forgone revenue is, for the greater part, clawed back, as I have said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Widespread concerns have been expressed in recent days as the actions of Labor, the Democrats and the Greens have become known regarding the effective destruction of this bill. I have received today a copy of a letter written today to Senator Kernot from Mr Lim, the Director of Policy Analysis and Research at the Business Council of Australia. I will quote a couple of paragraphs from that letter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Business Council understands that a potential investment of $2.5 billion over the period from now to 2002 is at risk. We also understand that the revenue effect of removing the restriction on transfer benefits so as to allow these projects to remain eligible for the allowance is approximately $90 million to the period 2002.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important to recognise that the development allowance is not a concession in any real sense as it was enacted in recognition of tax biases which discriminate against major investments. In the absence of comprehensive tax reform which gave proper recognition to flow&hyphen;through of deductions and losses and right-off periods for capital expenditure, it would be both inequitable and detrimental to the economy to curtail or limit the benefits of the development allowance.</PARA>
<PARA>The Business Council says that it is bringing its concerns to Senator Kernot in relation to the impact that her actions will have on those projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that at a major business and industry lunch in Sydney today, the Tourism Task Force, whose chief executive is Mr Christopher Brown, called very forcibly on the Labor Party and the Democrats to drop their opposition to the government's bill as drafted. I will mention some of the reasons given by Mr Brown for their view. He said that tax concessions or infrastructure bonds were vital for the development of tourism transport infrastructure, such as a tollway linking Sydney's airport with the CBD or a Brisbane-Gold Coast road. Mr Brown also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We want the ALP and the Democrats to support the Government's legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is an unwelcome piety about infrastructure funding in Australia highlighted by the current controversy surrounding Government amendments <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2573"> to the Development Allowance Authority legislation that erupted in Federal Parliament this week.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Brown then said that the Democrats and the opposition, by denying road projects and infrastructure bond support, had expressed the belief that there was a never&hyphen;ending stream of funds available for that infrastructure. I agree very much indeed with those comments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Anyone would think that there is a never&hyphen;ending stream for investment in worthwhile infrastructure and development projects in Australia. Any person with any knowledge of the financial situation in Australia, the overall situation facing investment and our need for development knows perfectly well that there is not an unlimited supply and that worthwhile projects deserve appropriate incentives. That is what this bill is all about. It always has been about that. We have increasingly recognised that over the years and that is why we are taking every step to ensure that worthwhile valuable projects&mdash;40 of them&mdash;are going to be able to access the development allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those reasons the government is totally insistent and consistent in its view on this matter. We will not be changing our position on this. No threats, no blackmail and no bullying by Senator Kernot, or Senator Cook or anyone else is going to change our position on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let there be no mistake at all about this: the blame for this major set back to development in Australia, to the creation of new jobs, to the improvement of Australia's infrastructure and to improved living standards for all Australians fairly and very squarely will lie at the feet of the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats. That will be seen by all Australians, I have no doubt at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although it is far too late now, because they have painted themselves into an inextricable position, I urge senators opposite, if they have any sense of responsibility for the needs of development in Australia, to change their attitude to this bill. I know it is a lost cause to ask them to do so, but I do it in a final ditch to save the development projects that have been put at such jeopardy and risk by the&mdash;and I repeat the words very deliberately&mdash;rogue and unprincipled actions of the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Democrats, the Greens and the Labor Party on this bill in recent days.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Throughout his speech the minister used the word `ideological' as if it were a dirty word. Another word for `ideological' and the way the Greens see ideology from our point of view is `principles' and the four pillars by which the Greens operate: peace and disarmament, participatory democracy, social justice and environmental integrity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at three of those pillars on the basis upon which we made our decision. Participatory democracy: what does the community think about this subsidy decision? They think it stinks. If we listened to what the community thinks about this decision to give an extra subsidy to tollways, we would hear that they think it stinks. So on that basis we should listen to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is it justice; is it a fair way to spend taxpayers' money; is it giving it to the people who need money? No. On the basis of ideology or principles&mdash;whichever way you like to put it&mdash;we say that, no, it is not a good judgement. In relation to the environment: is this a good way to spend taxpayers' money; is this very environmentally sound? No.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Funnily enough, on three quite clear principles upon which the Greens operate it gets a cross. There are lots of decisions in this place which might be difficult; this was not one of them. This was a real easy one, because it got a cross on three of those four principles. So if you are wondering how we made the decision, it was on the basis of ideology, if you like&mdash;we call it principles. In your last quote, did the person actually say, `The bill as drafted'?

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 2 June at Wattlegrove in Sydney's south-west, a meeting was held to protest the federal government's decision to undertake an environmental impact study for a second Sydney airport at Holsworthy. The member for Hughes attended. It has been reported to me by a number of people, including several parliamentary colleagues who attended the meeting, that the member for Hughes misrepresented both me and my colleague the former member for Hughes, the Hon. Robert Tickner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Hughes claimed that she did not know about the proposal to build an airport at Holsworthy. The member for Hughes quoted me as saying, `Robert Tickner certainly did'&mdash;that is, know about the coalition's Holsworthy airport proposal.She was implying that he knew but did nothing. That is a gross misrepresentation of what I said. On 30 May 1996 I said in the parliament about the member for Hughes that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">She says that, when she was a candidate, she did not know about the possible Holsworthy airport site. Robert Tickner certainly did.</PARA>
<PARA>The next line is very significant. I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He spoke out. The Sutherland council spoke out.</PARA>
<PARA>Only minutes earlier in that same speech I described Robert Tickner's activism on behalf of the people of Hughes. I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Mr Tickner, who was the member for Hughes before the last election, Sutherland council and others in the area had put to me arguments against that proposal for the airport.</PARA>
<PARA>Danna Vale was implying that Robert Tickner kept the information to himself. In my speeches of 29 and 30 May 1996 I described Mr Tickner's response to the Holsworthy proposal.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senator CHILDS</EMPHASIS>  (New South Wales) (1.52 p.m.)--I would like to deal with two matters that are very serious for my city of Sydney. They are two examples of the duplicity of this government, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2579"> and of the betrayal by the Howard government of the people of Sydney as far as aircraft noise and the positioning of airports in my city are concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, I would like to turn to a speech I made on the adoption of the aircraft noise in Sydney report on 30 November 1995. I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I just want to draw attention to why we say that we should prohibit the take-off of planes to the north from the third runway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This week the opposition was sprung in an article in the Financial Review by Tom Burton, headed `Coalition risks new airport noise protest'. He pointed out the fact that under the coalition government proposal--if they were to be in government--planes would be taking off to the north on the existing third runway. Of course, that is the secret plan. Although Senator Parer, as the shadow minister, was quick to deny it, I point out to the people of Sydney, particularly those people who will be affected, that this is just another way the opposition would, if they were ever in the government, vastly affect them in relation to activity that has been banned.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of course, I was right and the people of Sydney were wronged, because the government of Mr Howard has gone ahead and is doing that. The major betrayal I want to refer to today is a much more serious one. It is the Holsworthy airport proposal whereby 450,000 people in various parts of south-west Sydney would be adversely affected. That is on one reading of it. That is one possibility. It is a serious proposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The alternative is that this government is just putting up a smokescreen so that there will be no second airport for Sydney and so that some of the vested interests will not move out of Sydney. People in the inner city of Sydney will have to put up with extensive noise. Whereas our government was moving strongly to develop Badgerys Creek, this government now has stopped in the process and they have proposed this Holsworthy option.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I remember, as a member of this select committee looking into aircraft noise, that we had a proposal from a Mr Pickrell, from a North Shore group. He was following the tradition, I think, that people want an airport but not in their own area. I quote now from the evidence where Mr Pickrell said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It may well be that this has to be surrendered as a water source and used as a recreational facility instead.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He is referring there to the Woronora Reserve.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Closeness to the Lucas Heights atomic energy installation was mentioned in the EIS and our view is that it may be necessary to move the facility, which would get a lot of cheers from the people of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Sutherland. It certainly would not be accepted as a hindrance to a new airport.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So he referred to it in his proposal. Yesterday, I asked Senator Parer, the minister representing the Minister for Science and Technology, what the government would do as far as a Lucas Heights proposal was concerned. Senator Parer did not answer that question that I asked him yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is very significant because in the 1979 report of the major airport needs of Sydney, where a careful evaluation was made, the people making that evaluation made the point that Lucas Heights was a significant issue as far as a nuclear reactor was concerned and, of course, that was not addressed by Senator Parer yesterday. It is a major problem and it seriously affects the financial probity of any proposal. But, of course, we do not know who the developers have behind them. We do not know what resources they have. We have no idea at all of how effective that proposal will be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We certainly know that it is a problem, particularly for the people of Sutherland. As soon as Mr Pickrell presented his material to the committee, I got in touch with Mr Robert Tickner, then the member for Hughes, and he immediately took that matter up in opposition, leading the people of Sutherland against that proposal. The unfortunate thing for Mr Tickner was that the government, then the opposition, did not share that with the people. This is a devious government that we face in Australia at the present. Even though Mr Howard--`honest John Howard'--came before our committee he did not present to us what he had on his mind; in other words, the Holsworthy option was never given to the people of Sutherland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Tickner fought that issue before the election and it will be very interesting to find out whether the Liberal candidate for Sutherland--she is now, at the last minute, taking up the issue--ever raised her voice on behalf of the people of Sutherland against the Holsworthy proposal. Mr Tickner pointed out to me at the time, as did other people, the reasons why the people of Sutherland opposed the Liberal and National parties' proposal for an airport in the middle of their backyard. People who saw the proposal rejected scientifically years ago, in the MANS report, are now seeing a Liberal Party that is desperate to do something after the election that they did not have the guts, the intestinal fortitude, to put to the people before the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I can only say that there will be another election and those people will know the issues. We will make sure that the people know the issues. Just as Senator Forshaw said, `We will make sure you know the issues'. The government will regret its duplicity because the people in the south-west of Sydney will oppose the government at the next election. We will make it a referendum on the sincerity of Mr Howard. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2580"> </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senator CHILDS</EMPHASIS>  (New South Wales) (7.40 p.m.)--I had responsibility before the last election for the Sutherland area of Sydney. Before question time yesterday I was speaking about the opposition of the people in the south-west of the state to the proposal by the government to have an airport at Holsworthy. I was referring to the fact that Mr Tickner, who was the member for Hughes before the last election, Sutherland council and others in that area had put to me arguments against that proposal for the airport. I would like to continue to emphasise in the Senate the points that they made. The studies have been done. Holsworthy has been rejected as a suitable site since the 1970s. The only reason to do another EIS is as a sop to the coalition's big business constituency, and that is either the existing airport organisations or the new consortium.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senator Faulkner</EMPHASIS> --Did the Lawrence Hargraves mob come and give some evidence to the committee?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senator CHILDS</EMPHASIS> --Yes, they all gave evidence in the sense that they are hesitant about the second Badgerys Creek airport--that is really the bottom line. Of course, the consortium itself has not been sighted. I do not know who they are or what they are up to. It is a mystery at the moment because we had no indication before the election of the devious deal that has been done by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Parer's pre-election promise to the people of Sydney that Badgerys Creek will go ahead is put on hold now by this government. Is this just an excuse for further delays of Badgerys Creek? That is the worry, because that is a threat to all the people in the inner city of Sydney who at the moment have the problem of noise arising from Mascot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">An EIS is not necessary. We know Holsworthy is not suitable. While the proposed airport at Badgerys Creek will be 15 kilometres from the nearest houses, the Holsworthy site is within three kilometres of some of Sydney's fastest growing suburbs, including Wattle Grove, which is only a stone's throw from the site. In the last 10 years 300,000 people have moved into the suburbs near the site.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The area already has Australia's only nuclear reactor, which I have referred to earlier, and the largest garbage tip in the Southern Hemisphere. The site has significant cultural value; it contains a number of Aboriginal sites. A recent unpublished survey by the Australian museum of the Holsworthy site shows that the land supports examples of sandstone vegetation and rarer Cumberland Plain <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> vegetation. Living in this environment are endangered frogs and reptiles, koalas and quolls. I know that Senator Brownhill is concerned about those sorts of things. In fact this is one of the few remaining healthy koala colonies in the Sydney region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Holsworthy site is part of a catchment area for the Georges River. The western site of the airport will sit almost on the bank of the river. The erosion and siltation due to the construction process will be more than the river can bear, not to mention the effect of increased aircraft and car pollution in the area. The Georges River supports a number of sensitive mangrove bird and fish breeding grounds. The residents of south-western Sydney have objected to the airport on environmental grounds and because it will affect the quality of life, as I have already mentioned, of 430,000 people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">From a more pragmatic perspective, how would an airport at Holsworthy cope with the massive floods which historically affect the Liverpool-Holsworthy area? How will the flood plains be affected by the massive earthworks required by the airport and associated infrastructure? There are high costs associated with clearing up unexploded ordnances in the military site. There are topographical problems. The land is very uneven, with deep ravines. This is the madness that this government is proposing in the geographic area that is proposed for Holsworthy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Waste cannot be used to fill the ravines because of settlement problems. One hundred and forty million cubic tonnes of earth landfill would have to be found to level the site. Sutherland council told the Senate aircraft noise committee that they doubted whether there was enough landfill anywhere in Sydney to fill the ravines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The southern part of Holsworthy was rejected as a possible site in the 1980s because of the constraints already mentioned. The northern part of the site was advocated by the Pickrell group, which I have referred to earlier, but that part is too close to the residential areas. In contrast, the MANS study in the 1970s pointed to Badgerys Creek as a suitable site for a second Sydney airport. The same report rejected Holsworthy, as I have said already. Although there is some local opposition to an airport at Badgerys Creek, the proposal has a great deal of local support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Liverpool council, a very large council in Sydney, and other local bodies in the area have welcomed Badgerys Creek and indeed have planned infrastructure on the assumption that the airport would go ahead. In contrast, Liverpool and Bankstown councils have vowed to fight the Holsworthy proposal. It is not insignificant that the Liberal Party has dodged the by-election in the Bankstown area. They know the people of Bankstown know <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2581"> they will be affected and are angry about this government's betrayal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The federal government has already spent $800,000 on the Badgerys Creek site. No-one will be living within 15 kilometres of the Badgerys Creek airport site. That contrasts the thousands who currently live within 15 kilometres of Kingsford Smith airport. Suburbs such as Sutherland, Engadine, Waterfall, Menai, Woronora, Lucas Heights, Milperra, Panania, Revesby, Padstow, Picnic Point, Fairfield, Granville, Hammondville, Chipping Norton, Moorebank, Guildford, Chester Hill, Parramatta and Lidcombe will be affected. The proposed east-west runway points directly at Minto and Macquarie Fields. Planes will fly over both Westmead and Auburn hospitals and the long-established retirement village of Hammondville.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">So much for getting away from it all by going bushwalking or camping in the Royal National Park. This national park is one of the oldest in the world, but to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) and this government it is just another flight path. Minister Sharp is calling Holsworthy `an insurance policy'. That is the ultimate insult. Meanwhile, there is no insurance and no security for the thousands of people who would be affected by this proposal. Their lives are on hold. They cannot sell their homes. They could not move out of the path of destruction even if they wanted to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Sharp has added fuel to the fire by emphasising Holsworthy's supposed advantages as a site. One of those advantages is that the site is big enough to accommodate future expansion--whatever that means. It is cold comfort for the people of south-western Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I must comment on the member for Hughes, Mrs Danna Vale, who is a Liberal member of parliament. She says that, when she was a candidate, she did not know about the possible Holsworthy airport site. Robert Tickner certainly did. He spoke out. The Sutherland council spoke out. I know she does not live in the electorate, but that is not the real problem. The real problem is that she is not believable because she has no excuse for not defending the people of her electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would now like to completely move away from the Holsworthy airport issue, but I do want to speak about another injustice. Michelle Cornwell was a deputy clerk of the Queensland parliament. She is a conservative, non-radical person devoted to the enhancement of parliamentary democracy, but this is too much for the National-Liberal Party government of Queensland. She has been sacked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Michelle Cornwell organised a number of seminars to assist the Queensland parliament set up a committee system, including an estimates committee process, in which I and other senators <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> participated on several occasions. This was done under a Labor government as part of the development of the checks and balances needed for executive government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">But the barbarians are back in Queensland. The sons and daughters of Bjelke-Petersen are now turning back the clock, and Michelle Cornwell--who many senators will recall worked in the Senate as a senior officer with impeccable, professional impartiality--has been crudely sacked. I support her work in the development of a code of conduct for members of parliament. I feel shock and horror if the review caused her sacking. A review of the pecuniary interests of members of parliament might have been the catalyst for her elimination. Whatever the reasons, it is a scandal. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The practice of presenting this schedule to the Senate follows the undertaking by successive governments to respond to parliamentary committee reports in timely fashion. On 26 May 1978 the then Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Withers) informed the Senate that within six months of the tabling of a committee report, the responsible Minister would make a statement in the Parliament outlining the action the Government proposed to take in relation to the report. The period for responses was reduced from six months to three months in 1983 by the then incoming government. The then Leader of the Government in the Senate announced this change on 24 August <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 1983. The method of response continued to be by way of statement. Subsequently the former Labor Government advised that responses to committee reports would be made by letter to a committee chairman, with the letter being tabled in the Senate at the earliest opportunity. In those cases, the date of the presentation of the Government's response to the Senate was taken as the date that the response was presented, not the date of any correspondence with the committee.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The schedule does not usually include reports of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works or the Senate Standing Committees on Appropriations and Staffing, Selection of Bills, Procedure, Publications, Regulations and Ordinances and Scrutiny of Bills, though such reports will be included if they require a response. Government responses to reports of the Public Works Committee are normally reflected in motions for the approval of works after the relevant report has been presented and considered. Responses to reports of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts are usually made in the form of Finance Minutes which are tabled by the committee. Where a response has been made by way of Finance Minute, the date of presentation has been appropriately annotated.</PARA>

<STATE> (Victoria)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(3.24 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) has more significance than perhaps the Senate recognises. Many senators who have made contributions so far have pointed this out. Senator Spindler and Senator Chamarette have made excellent contributions. It is sad that this is the last time that they will have the opportunity to speak in this chamber. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2588"> Both have been particularly conscious of the civil rights of people. I have had a closer look at what Senator Spindler does than what Senator Chamarette does.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since I am saying nice and proper things about people, I should also mention that it is the last day that Marcia O'Hara will be engaged in this area. Like many other staffers, she has done great work, particularly in the field of civil liberties. It is a sad day, but it is a day that should also be marked as a day of triumph.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will be supporting this bill, along with my party. Senator Spindler made some remarks about that. I want to get on and deal with the bill. I simply refer Senator Spindler to Edmund Burke's defence of party&mdash;he is a person of conservative mould; nevertheless I think he was right on this occasion&mdash;and his thoughts on the cause of the present discontent in his works of 1792 volume 1 page 498.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill has brought a lot of disquiet to many people of goodwill. The criticism that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> has been made of the department ought to be seen in context. They have to perform a very difficult task. There is a need to protect our borders from those who come in and have no right to be here. That has concerned the department over many years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I notice that Mr Matt Moroney and Ms Yole Daniels from the department are in the chamber now. They, along with the rest of the people in that department, have got not only an intellectual concern but also a compassionate concern about this. Mr Bert Mowbray represents with distinction a very distinguished department, the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Section 256 of the Migration Act has been quoted in this debate. In some respects section 257 of the act is more worrying. Section 257 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> For the purpose of determining whether a person who is in immigration detention under this Act is an unlawful non&hyphen;citizen, a removee or a deportee, an officer may put to that person such questions as the officer considers necessary and may move that person from place to place.</PARA>
<PARA>The officer can question that person and move that person from place to place. Subsection (2)&mdash;and I will refer to this more in the committee stage&mdash;states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Where an officer puts a question to a person in accordance with subsection (1) after having informed that person that he or she is required to answer the question, that person shall not:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> refuse or fail to answer the question; or</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> in answer to the question, make a statement which is false or misleading in a material particular.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Penalty: Imprisonment for 6 months.</PARA>
<PARA>If people are going to be imprisoned or have their reputations ruined, then they certainly should have legal advice. This bill will stop anyone telling them what rights they may or may not have or explaining section 257 to them. That is a matter of considerable concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People have said that the difficulty with all of this is that people who are in fact refugees may be denied the sorts of rights that we would like to think they have. It is argued on the other side that these people in many cases are not refugees. Of course that is right. But, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2589"> as has been pointed out again and again in this debate, that is hardly the question. The question is whether or not we are going to have a legal system that operates effectively and as well and as mightily as it should.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must confess that I have concerns when people propose, as is proposed in the second reading speech, that the expenditure of $2 million in respect of these people who came here in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Albatross</EMPHASIS> is necessary to see the matter through. When people's rights, liberties and future are affected, $2 million hardly seems a great sum of money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I propose to go through the second reading speech because I think it is not put in a way that clarifies as it should. I use that word to begin to outline my worries about this bill. The first paragraph of the second reading speech says this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this Bill is to amend the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Migration Act 1958</EMPHASIS>  to clarify the rights of certain people&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Now that is not right. It does not clarify; it changes the rights of certain people. Clarification is not needed. The clarification is contained in the decision in respect of which this act was brought in. So this is not a proposal to clarify at all; it is a proposal to change. I would like that to be clarified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the third paragraph it says this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The onus is on unlawful non&hyphen;citizens who arrive without a visa to advise officials as to why they have come to Australia and if they wish to seek legal advice.</PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps I can be given an answer to this when we come to a later part of the debate, but the problem is that in a certain sense it does not do that. The onus is not, as presently the law reads, to do that because they can be given advice as it now stands and then they can seek legal advice if they want to. The onus arrives only, surely, when they get to know that they have a right. Perhaps that is badly put. I will put it this way: to say the onus is on them is correct to a certain extent, but the law is not that they have to bear that onus on their own. They are able, as the law presently stands, to discharge that onus after getting advice from people outside. That is perhaps the more accurate way of putting it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last sentence of the fourth paragraph of the second reading speech this is said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This approach is clearly intended by the Migration Act, and has been upheld by the courts in a number of recent cases.</PARA>
<PARA>That is not quite the case either. It talks about section 256 making provision for access to legal advice by persons in immigration detention, but only where the person in immigration detention requests legal advice. That is true, but it does not follow that that is what was clearly intended by the Migration Act in the sense that the Migration Act intended that no method should be available other than out of the person's own head. The Migration Act does not intend, as it presently stands, that people will not be able to get outside advice on a non&hyphen;solicited basis. It does not presently intend that because the judge made it clear that that is not what it means.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last sentence of the fifth paragraph says this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effect of this action would have been to ensure access to legal advice, despite the fact that none was requested.</PARA>
<PARA>That is not accurate either. The only way they can get legal advice is if they request it. What the act says, as it now stands, is that they can be advised that they can take legal action and, in the light of that knowledge being given to them, they can then request it. Why we need a bill to meet that last sentence is beyond me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effect of the action that I previously spoke about would have been to ensure access to legal advice despite the fact that none was requested. The fact of the matter is that people request the advice: the lawyers cannot force themselves onto these people. All the lawyers can say is that they are there ready to give advice if it is wanted, but to imply that these lawyers or advisers from outside will force their legal services on them is not correct. That part of the second reading speech, along with the rest of those matters, should be put right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last sentence in the next paragraph reads this way:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effect of this case is that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Act 1986</EMPHASIS>  can be used to override the intention of the Migration Act.</PARA>
<PARA>It does not do that at all. The intention of the Migration Act has been set out in the decision of Mr Justice Lindgren. The intention of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2590"> Migration Act is that it operate, together with all the other law, in the way that the judge has said it does. So if we are going to change the law, let us change the law on actual principles&mdash;not on a set of propositions which are just not correct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next paragraph says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the Federal Court's ruling RACS has sought access to all recently arrived boat people. In other words, RACS is engaged in a direct attack on the fundamental underpinnings of our capacity to manage effectively the boat people issue.</PARA>
<PARA>That is really an insult to people from RACS. I have nothing but the highest regard for people who work in the immigration department and in the Attorney-General's Department, but I have also got high regard for the people that work in RACS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are not doing that. They are not trying to ruin the system. What they are trying to do&mdash;whether rightly or wrongly&mdash;is to see that people know what rights they have when they come to Australia. If we want to stop those rights, then let us alter their rights. The reason we have these great problems is because of the constitution, and that has been put in argument before in this debate, and it is section 75(v.) of the constitution that has everybody worried.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only way we are going to overcome this problem we have&mdash;if it is a problem&mdash;is to change the constitution. People would not want to do that because, if we take rights away from the people from outside, then we take the rights away from people inside the country. That is what has got everybody worried, and so it should. The second reading speech goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The approach adopted by RACS will encourage boat people to engage in unwarranted, lengthy and expensive processing.</PARA>
<PARA>Whether the process is unwarranted, lengthy and expensive is, I suppose, a matter we ought to look at when we are looking at the costs of justice. But let us not say, in a derogatory way, that our legal system is unwarranted, lengthy and expensive. It might be in certain respects but, by and large, we have one of the best legal systems equipped with some of the greatest judges in the world, and to, by inference, insult the system in this <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> way is, I must confess, not the sort of thing that I like to do in a second reading speech.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a later paragraph, the speech says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed bill will ensure parliament's intention in relation to the management of unauthorised arrivals in immigration detention, as reflected by s.256 of the Migration Act&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Then it says that the parliament's intention is that set out by the court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only other thing I want to say is that one of the problems with this suggested legislation is this: if, in fact, there are people who are rorting the system, who come out from China according to a plan, they are going to be the ones that know about section 256 because the people who are arranging the scam will tell them about 256. The only people who will not know about 256 are likely to be the people who are the genuine refugees. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;On 23 and 27 May, Senators Newman and Hill respectively tabled documents in response to a Senate motion that, among other things, ordered that all records relating to the employment of Ms Jeannie Ferris by the Commonwealth be tabled. Notwithstanding that we have complied with the order, which consequently was removed from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>  and so no longer strictly applies, searches have continued to ensure that all relevant records have been located and tabled.

<STATE> (South Australia)</STATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I thank Senator Kemp for these documents. Can I say at the outset that the opposition has always maintained that we have not had all the documents on this matter, and we still maintain that now. I would like to put the Leader of the Government (Senator Hill) on notice at this particular stage that, when we resume in budget session, in the estimates process we will ensure that other documentation which should have been made available to us is made available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I particularly refer Senator Hill to this because he has responsibility in this place to represent the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). Senator Minchin is Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister. The documentation which relates to this matter from Senator Minchin and his involvement on this matter has been forthcoming to the Senate, and that is one batch of documentation that we want.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Documentation always throws up new aspects and new matters or confirms old ones. It is interesting to see in this particular case the documentation indicates that we are talking about cessation and termination in a document marked 30 April. This person was not employed for three days, as Senator Minchin maintained; this person was employed for a lot longer, and this documentation confirms that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have two other concerns that I wish to place on record. One is that there are disturbing suggestions from within the Liberal Party in South Australia that documentation relating to this matter has been destroyed&mdash;documentation which may in fact be quite important if this matter ever goes to the High Court. I have placed that on the public record during the course of this week, and that documentation is something that we are very concerned about. For anyone to destroy documentation which should be produced in this place is Nixonian in the least. Once again, Senator Minchin, we place you on notice that we will be seeking out that documentation. We also suggest to Senator&hyphen;elect Ferris in this context that if she does get to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this place she will need a lead vest&mdash;not to protect her from us, Senator Faulkner, but from her colleagues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other matter that needs to be raised in respect to this is that there is some suggestion that there has been a secret deal done in South Australia to have Senator&hyphen;elect Ferris resign and then to have her position filled by a secret arrangement by the Premier of that state. Can I say to the Senate that, if Senator&hyphen;elect Ferris is not validly elected to the position, then she has nothing to resign from.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a matter that may in fact still have to be argued before the court and I think over the next few days, and before any decision is taken by her or for her by Administrative Services or by this place, there needs to be very careful attention given to her status. If she was not elected validly, then she does not have a position from which to resign. The government ought to take very close cognisance of that particular fact because, unless this matter is cleared up by the highest judicial authority, then it may linger on during the next three, four or five months.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is appropriate that the last time I address this chamber is on an Auditor&hyphen;General's report. It is of particular interest to the ABC and deals with whether or not the ABC is being commercially alert in the area of co&hyphen;productions. This is a matter of significance at a time when there are the usual tight budgetary constraints on expenditure and money going to the ABC. The Australian National Audit Office surveyed all Commonwealth budget funding entities engaged in any joint venture, partnership, collaborative agreement or ongoing contractual relationship with the private sector.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The reason I was interested in this from the ABC's point of view is that, as the report said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ABC Television&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>with co&hyphen;productions totalling about $35 million a year&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">has well&hyphen;established arrangements for managing the technical production aspects of the co&hyphen;production process. However, there is no comprehensive  documentation of the reporting of progress of program production to management other than budgetary outlays. As a consequence, the sequence of activities from initial identification of a possible program topic through scriptwriting to production and management of ongoing returns runs the risk of not being properly coordinated. There is scope for improved and better documented program delivery procedures to identify clearly the various steps (and their associated milestones). Without these and their associated reporting requirements, there is an increased risk to program delivery and of cost overruns.</PARA>
<PARA>I want to stress `and of cost overruns'. ABC Television management, according to this audit report, has:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . advised the ANAO that although there are no published guidelines regarding the commissioning process the current practice is sufficient and clearly understood by all staff involved in the process. It is intended that the ABC's Efficiency Review and Audit Unit (ERA) will revisit the process with a view of identifying any areas of improvement. However&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and I must say this on behalf of the ABC&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the ABC is not aware of any instances where a co&hyphen;production has not been properly coordinated or resulted in increased risk to program delivery. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2593"> </PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, this case is one of those situations where the Auditor&hyphen;General is suggesting that the ABC should go by the book, rather than perhaps using its nous or experience. There is always going to be a serious problem in areas like this because the Auditor&hyphen;General says that in the ABC:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . individual managers tended to use their experience to minimise technical risks; for example, expensive or complicated segments in an ABC Television co&hyphen;production are completed first or given highest priority to ensure there is time to reshoot if there are unforeseen circumstances such as bad weather but there was no explicit strategy to minimise the business risk.</PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor&hyphen;General's point is simply this. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . ABC Television was exposed to a number of financial risks without adequate contingency plans or safeguards in place. For example, a major justification for the expenditure of some $10 million to produce additional episodes of a series was in order to enter the North American market. However, the ANAO found no evidence of any market or sales analysis in support of this expenditure decision. The ABC has advised the ANAO that the main justification for the production of the extra episodes was a domestic transmission need&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>That is, domestic rather than the overseas market. Whoever is right, the fact is that there clearly are some financial risks and there is, I would think, a need for proper procedures. The Auditor&hyphen;General then goes on to another, I think far more serious, problem, that is, the extent to which the ABC has been using its financial power, its status, to get the best possible deal out of co&hyphen;productions. The Auditor&hyphen;General says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Discussions with the private sector suggested that Commonwealth agencies did not always fully appreciate the strength (and value) of the Commonwealth's negotiating position and might not be as well prepared as perhaps they could be prior to the commencement of negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, this extends far beyond the ABC. I think 61 such commercial arrangements were examined by the Auditor&hyphen;General. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This was confirmed by a general lack of adequate documentation in ABC Television to support the various positions adopted and the tendency to react to offers from partners rather than take the initiative and drive the proposals. It was also suggested that a key motivation for industry to seek a Common <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> wealth partner is to gain leverage through the relationship i.e. to an industry partner the relationship is possibly often more important strategically than the immediate financial benefits. The ANAO considers this position deserves better recognition by Commonwealth agencies in general.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that insufficient consideration is given to the revenue raising or savings opportunities offered by the two ventures examined&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that includes the ABC&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ANAO also observed inadequate monitoring of royalties due to the Commonwealth. In 1992 the ABC's Efficiency Review and Audit Unit brought forward six recommendations covering the need for a management information system to ensure management was aware of the financial performance of co&hyphen;production investments. To date these recommendations have not been implemented . . . the ANAO noted that details of returns owing to the ABC on one series were some 21 months overdue.</PARA>
<PARA>This is from an organisation which is continually crying poor. Clearly, there is scope for considerable improvement. The audit office says further on this issue:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there is scope to improve the financial returns or savings available to ABC Television&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and it notes this is also the case for Australian Archives&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Other">. . . from their joint commercial dealings by giving greater prominence to such considerations in the development and negotiation of arrangements in the first place as well as in ongoing monitoring mechanisms.</PARA>
<PARA>The ANAO concludes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there are opportunities for better planning and management of these joint commercial arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt that there will be increasing numbers of joint commercial arrangements of this kind. It is important that there be proper guidelines set down&mdash;not that I am suggesting that all these things should be done by the book; often they need much greater flexibility. There is obviously scope for a better system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2594"> Finally, I would like to thank the Auditor-General, his staff and his predecessors, particularly Mr John Taylor, for the excellent work they have done on behalf of the parliament and people of Australia to ensure that proper financial standards and full accounta bility requirements are being met by government and instrumentalities.

<TIME.STAMP>(3.55 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also want to raise a matter to do with Senator Alston's portfolio of communications and the arts, and it concerns Australia Post. I am normally a very great defender and supporter of Australia Post, its role in Australian society and the service it provides. I think it often gets very badly maligned. People use it as an easy excuse for letters not arriving when they have actually not been sent in the first place and that sort of thing. So I am always very defensive of Australia Post. I think the service is actually better than most people's impression of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The complaint I want to make today about Australia Post relates to their withdrawal of a complete service: the air parcel service within Australia. This has been done, it seems to me, without any proper public announcement. I have not seen any advice to us. I have not seen any advertisements in newspapers or press statements to that effect. There have been small notices in post offices saying that this service will no longer exist next Monday, 1 July.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The withdrawal of this service means that there are basically only two options when sending parcels through Australia Post: surface mail or express post. I think the express post service is very good. In fact, for some parcels it is a very economical and worthwhile service. If you can get a parcel of under three kilograms into the appropriate express post satchel, it goes anywhere in the country for $7.50 and, if it is going to another capital city or other places within the network, overnight delivery is guaranteed. As senators would know, a service which costs $5 is available for smaller parcels under 500 grams.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem with the withdrawal of the ordinary air parcel service is that, if people want their parcels to go faster than surface <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> post, they will have to use express post. For a small parcel that is under 250 grams, which could have gone anywhere in the country by air for $2.50, people will now have to pay $5&mdash;a 100 per cent increase. The slightly larger small parcels which are under 500 grams used to go by air anywhere in the country for $3.70. We will now have to pay $5&mdash;something like a 35 per cent increase.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said before, parcels between 500 grams and three kilograms can, if they fit into the right satchel, go for $7.50, which is not bad. But beyond that the sorts of rates that are charged for express post are very expensive and involve substantial increases compared with the air parcel charges at present. And if you are sending parcels outside the express post network you do not get the advantage of the 24&hyphen;hour service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For people who say that $80 is too much to pay for sending a fairly substantial parcel by express post&mdash;and it would be of that sort of order, especially if it is going some distance&mdash;the alternative would be the surface parcel service. I am not saying that is a bad service but it is slow, especially for more remote communities. The boat across Bass Strait operates only three nights a week. If you are in Tasmania and you do not post your parcel on the right day, it adds substantially to the time it takes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also this disadvantage to Western Australians, Northern Territorians, North Queenslanders and perhaps even more so to the residents of the island territories of Christmas, Cocos and Norfolk islands, who use the air parcel service quite substantially for normal communications with the mainland. I am talking about parcels going in both directions; to and from all these places. These people will now have to use express post at a substantially greater cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Basically, I have two complaints. The first is the withdrawal of the service and the greater expense that Australians will be put to in sending and receiving parcels if they do not want to tolerate a slower service. The second is that this withdrawal of a whole service has not been given a great deal of publicity. People will gradually discover it as they seek to send a parcel, perhaps quite <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2595"> urgently, next Christmas. Australia Post should not have done this, and in the way that they have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) will look at this matter, discuss it with Australia Post and convince them that they should reverse their decision. We are not just talking about a change in the rate of charge per gram for a parcel or anything like that. We are talking about the total withdrawal of a whole service that people have been used to in this country. Once the disadvantaged areas of the country that I have referred to hear about it, they will regard it very seriously. I appeal to the minister and Australia Post, which is a body I support very strongly and have defended over many years. I hope that they can organise things in order to reverse this for the benefit of Australians who need this sort of service.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, might I say before commencing to speak on the adjournment that I am conscious of the fact that this is the last time you will occupy that chair. I simply want to place on record the appreciation of every honourable senator in this House for the distinguished and fair way that you have carried out your office.

Having found that out, to your clear embarrassment&mdash;you are blushing&mdash;I wish you, on behalf of us all, a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> happy day tomorrow and a long and successful life together.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I rise on the adjournment debate tonight to address some remarks to the Prime Minister of Australia (Mr Howard) in respect of the public defence the Prime Minister mounted which I heard on ABC radio to my total dismay this morning. That defence by the Prime Minister of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) was about Senator Herron's censure in this chamber yesterday, which was richly deserved. The Prime Minister said that Senator Herron was censured for a slip of the tongue. With the greatest respect, he is wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Among other things, Senator Herron was censured in here for not using his tongue on behalf of the government to talk to ATSIC. He failed completely to talk to them before setting out on a course of action which was about to force out of work thousands of ordinary Aboriginal Australians employed on the so-called work for the dole scheme, the CDEP. They are among about 30,000 ordinary Aboriginal Australians who voluntarily elect to accept less money to work on community development schemes than they would get by exercising their rights as ordinary Australians in getting unemployment benefits. I think they are doing their communities and the country a lot of good.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of the decisions that were taken by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs and the Prime Minister's government, more than 200 at just one community were told yesterday that they were about to be sacked. If the Prime Minister does not believe me, I can give him their telephone number. They live at Fitzroy Crossing. I am sure that they would be very glad to take his call.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure they reckon, just like me, that, as the Prime Minister heads back to Kirribilli House for the weekend, he ought to do a bit of reading and reflection. He ought to bring himself up to speed. The Prime Minister said on ABC radio that the thought police and the word police were hovering around Senator Herron. I do not think the people at Fitzroy Crossing who were told that they were to be sacked yesterday would consider themselves <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2596"> in either category. They are just ordinary Australians who were trying to go about a day's work. Senator Herron's decision was stopping them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister said that his knowledge of Senator Herron is that of an immensely compassionate man who has devoted his life to the relief of suffering. The people at Fitzroy Crossing unfortunately know him as a man who is making them suffer. The Prime Minister also used the expression `politically correct'. I do not think anyone could accuse or ever has accused me of being politically correct. I have certainly been accused of calling a spade a shovel more than once. I will tell you what I think political correctness has now become. Political correctness has become a gag that is designed to prevent discussions on things that need to be discussed. I can understand the sensitivity of the Prime Minister about political correctness because, from the tone of those statements this morning, he is still wearing like a crown of thorns the scars of the Asian immigration debate from 1988.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to turn to another expression the Prime Minister used in that interview. I was shocked and dismayed to hear him use it. It was that disgraceful and pejorative expression `the Aboriginal industry'. I have followed John Howard's career for 20 years. I have never heard him utter that expression before. It is a pejorative expression loaded with false racial undertones. It supports and fosters the worst misconceptions in the community about Aboriginal Australia. The last member of this parliament to use that expression of whom I am aware was the honourable member for Oxley, Pauline Hanson. She used it as a guest columnist in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin </EMPHASIS>on 11 June. She was kind enough to define it for us. This is what she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My comments on reconciliation . . . certainly spurred the Aboriginal Industry into action.</PARA>
<PARA>The member for Oxley then defined the phrase `Aboriginal industry' in what I believe is the accurate definition held by people like her. She said that the Aboriginal industry:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . has developed over the years into a culture, feeding off the taxes of ordinary, hard&hyphen;working Australians. It has attracted a mix of black and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> white activists, politicians, academics, ex&hyphen;politicians and people who see themselves as community leaders.</PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for Oxley was expelled from the Liberal Party for using racially derogatory language and sentiments, all of which are caught up in that expression. She must be absolutely delighted today to know that the party from which she was expelled now has as its leader the current Prime Minister of Australia, a man who is now talking her language.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister also said that Senator Herron was a caring and compassionate man. I also know a distinguished and compassionate Australian who has spent most of her public life helping to alleviate suffering. She is one of this country's most distinguished Australians. Her name is Lois O'Donoghue, and she is the chairperson of ATSIC. She is also suffering because of the decisions of Senator Herron.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the Prime Minister does not believe me, he should check the article Lois O'Donoghue wrote for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper. I am sure if he has not seen it, his press office would be happy to give it to him, and he should read it. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You can imagine the rage and frustration of many Aboriginal Australians when they read and hear about rorts in places such as the Redfern Legal Aid Service . . . faced with all of the desperate needs of their home communities.</PARA>
<PARA>She also said that people who rort the taxpayers' dollars should be nailed. I agree with that. Lois O'Donoghue also went on to say, rightly, that, despite all of these comments, we should not be afraid to face the facts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at another scheme in Australia, the diesel fuel rebate scheme. It costs the Australian taxpayers more every year in disbursements to farmers and miners than is contained in the whole of the ATSIC budget, including the third that is spent on the CDEP scheme. Senator Baume just talked about endorsing the National Audit Office. A report of the National Audit Office was tabled in this parliament a short time ago, and it identified more than $30 million worth of losses through maladministration of this scheme.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2597">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Prime Minister, put yourself in the position of an Aboriginal person who is watching and listening to this debate for just one minute. Are you angry that nobody in this parliament is screaming about the identified losses of over $30 million from the diesel fuel rebate scheme that Senator Baume has just told us about? No. All we have is wall to wall protestations about keeping the scheme in its entirety. No-one is screaming for greater accountability. No-one is screaming for a general direction to be issued to freeze all payments </PARA>
<PARA>under that scheme and stop tractors in their tracks across Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It takes a lot of work to get CDEP schemes off the ground. Is there maladministration in some of those schemes? Of course there is. Should you stop funding all of these schemes&mdash;including the majority that are properly administered&mdash;while you sort it out? I ask the minister fairly: should you issue a ministerial direction to freeze all of the outlays from the diesel fuel rebate scheme while you sort out the rorts in that? Of course you should not; only a fool would suggest that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the government did was make a totally unnecessary and ill considered decision in the politically correct name of Aboriginal accountability. It would have closed down all of these major elements of the CDEP scheme&mdash;the good along with the bad&mdash;without a single word to the organisation that in fact administered them. One of those communities desperately tried to talk to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs about this. They faxed him and phoned him for three days, and they could not talk to him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today was an extraordinary day. The cold hard facts are that the minister walked into this chamber to finish this debate. He tabled his new ministerial directions, which in fact put off the application of this special auditor for a full three months until October. If he had bothered to go to ATSIC, they would have told him the mess this would have caused. The decision not to even talk to them about it was not only reprehensible but stupid&mdash;stupid for the government because, if <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> they had sought advice as they should have, none of this mess would have happened. It all would have been unnecessary.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Re:(1) and (2)</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the absence of an effective definition of "consumer goods" it is not possible to answer questions one and two with any degree of precision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be noted that many goods can be either consumer goods or business inputs depending on the use to which they are put. Having said this, the attached list of approximately 2,600 Tariff Concession Orders and Commercial Tariff Concession Orders might loosely be considered "consumer goods".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The selection of "consumer" instruments has been made as follows:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> a range of individuals were allocated tariff chapters to analyse which concession orders may cover consumer goods; <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> on the basis of their subjective judgements as to the major use of a good (ie would the goods be used more frequently for personal use rather than a business application), the attached list was developed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I emphasise again that this identification of "consumer goods" is entirely arbitrary and has no official status. It is merely an attempt to identify those goods which might be expected to more commonly have a consumer end&hyphen;use.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Re:(3)</PARA>
