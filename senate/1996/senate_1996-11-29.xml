<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Minister, on Wednesday you told the Senate several times that it was not reasonable for the Commonwealth to continue to pay the states for students who had moved out of government schools. This was the basis of your plan to apply the enrolment benchmark adjustment. Is it not true that the Commonwealth recurrent moneys for schools are already paid on a per capita basis and, therefore, money already follows the student?</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator, I honestly believe that this matter has been canvassed again and again. We can continue to raise it. As you well understand, the EBA is designed to reflect a shift in students. You can, of course, focus on existing numbers of one portion&mdash;in your case, you choose to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> focus on the existing numbers in government schools&mdash;and disregard all population coming in. You can say, `If it follows the student, it should stay the same.' One wise man would say that&mdash;nonetheless, I have yet to find a wise man who does.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another wise man would say, `What is important about this is where the people are choosing to send their children.' Therefore, one does not look at today's student numbers for next year, the year after or the year after that; one looks at where the students in those years are going. On that basis, one obviously looks at where the new students coming in go to or, for that matter, where students in the existing population shift to. The EBA is designed to reflect that. Consequently, if there is a change in the proportion, that is, if students move as a whole, the EBA would be triggered. That is what it is designed to reflect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator, you understand how this works, Senator Allison understands how this works. We can keep repeating this, but it is exactly as I have related it to you. You, Senator Allison, the Australian Democrats and Labor would have it that if numbers stay the same in three, four, five, six or seven years time the money would be the same. This is an indicator, a reflection of a shift in the proportion of students, if not taking all the money from the states that they save by students shifting into the non-government sector. It is, in fact, splitting that saving with them. We think that is perfectly fair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand, Senator, that you have a different view and the Democrats have a different view. I have made that point in here before. We have a difference of policy here.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Patterson interjects, we have had a change of government. It is no surprise that we have had a change of policy. But it is no surprise, even without a change of government, that we would have differences of opinion. No amount of debate is going to change those opinions. There are times when something is such that people do not understand it, and debate will often help then.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I participated in a debate in this chamber earlier this year when there was a genuine misunderstanding as to the consequence of a particular matter. As a consequence of a genuine debate, where people were genuinely exchanging different views and arguing to a particular point, a bill was changed for the better. That was not because there was a difference of policy; it was because both sides of the chamber recognised what needed to be protected and were simply canvassing views about the best way to protect that. It related to one of the Attorney-General's bills. That is completely different. Here we have a difference of policy. You have different views from us and you are not going to agree. I accept that.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AW5">Senator CARR</NAME>
<STATE> (Victoria)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(9.07 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Minister, I put it to you that this is not just a question of a difference of policy. It is quite clear that there is a substantial difference in policy. I acknowledge that. I would be horrified to think otherwise, given the nature of the differences of our political philosophies. But this is not the issue of substance in question here. I am trying to get at what is the mechanism by which this government seeks to achieve its policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say that this policy is wrong, and I make it very clear that I do not run away from that statement. But I also say that this policy will have unintended consequences, one would have to presume, given your statements. The effect of these changes is to shift costs from the Commonwealth to the states and to take money away from the states in a manner which this parliament has not designated in a conscious form. It is one thing for you to come into the parliament and say, `I wish to take $1.5 billion out of the financial assistance grants.' You made that statement very clear in terms of the government, and the parliament makes a decision about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it is another thing to come in here and say, `We're seeking to achieve these savings in a manner which the states will then be able to administer in a certain way.' The point of these questions is to show to you, and hopefully the other senators in this chamber, that the consequences of your policies will be to take additional moneys away from the states. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6328"> So, rather than there being savings to the states, there will be additional costs to the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does that mean? In Victoria we have already seen very substantial cuts in spending for government schooling, to the tune of some 10 per cent. We have seen some 300 schools close. We have seen a further 113 schools identified for closure this year. We have a minister who actually feels that it is appropriate to go on the public record and suggest that we can do with less schooling for our children in that state, that those children can do more for their education by staying away from school, by staying at home, which was what he suggested just this week, and that we can therefore do with fewer teachers, fewer schools and fewer resources in education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am worried that a proposition such as this will play right into that sort of minister's hands. When he is faced with the prospect of further cuts of between $20 million and $30 million for every two per cent shift in the enrolment benchmark adjustment as a result of these policies, I am concerned that a minister like that&mdash;Minister Gude, who essentially is an educational philistine&mdash;will be able to say, `The Commonwealth parliament has told us to do this in this manner.' Of course, Minister, it is all very well, when the children of the next generation have this cruel experiment inflicted upon them, to say, `We didn't mean it that way.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why it is important for these measures to be thoroughly examined and for the senators to understand what the implications of this action are. I just do not accept the proposition that you are putting&mdash;that there are in fact savings. You claim that the states have access to these savings and that when students move from government to non-government schools the so-called saving is some $3,400. It is not some additional beneficial payment provided by the Commonwealth, as you continually imply.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(9.11 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think, by the contribution you have made, that you have in fact highlighted the point that I made. I appreciate that we found something that we <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> agree on&mdash;that we do have a disagreement. Maybe we can agree on more than that on another day, but at least today we have made that clear: you have a different philosophical approach to this from ours. You say that you would be horrified if it were the same. I would not be. I think there are many occasions in policy areas, including some in education, where the philosophies are the same. I would not exaggerate it to the point of saying that we are always going to disagree. But, on this, clearly we do. Clearly, the purpose of these debates is to give people the opportunity to outline their particular views and to persuade other senators.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have put the government's view to you&mdash;that the important thing for you to recognise, in our view, in consideration of what you want to do in this matter, is that we have set up this EBA, which is a mechanism designed to reflect shifts in students. We think that is appropriate; you do not. I have also asked you to consider that on our calculations&mdash;rough as they might be, but I do not think they are going to be far off&mdash;the EBA, that you seek to spend so much time on discussing, roughly works out at just over three per cent of SPPs. If you include the total funding for schools&mdash;that is, SPPs and FAGs&mdash;you will find that it is less than one per cent. That is what we are talking about in relation to the disagreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that you further say in effect that you do not trust the states or, in particular, you do not trust the state of Victoria; maybe the whole lot. You expect this is an insecure path to go down because the states will not necessarily do the right thing. I just repeat what I have indicated to you in the past: on preliminary estimates made by the department, using documents available from state governments, the best information we have is that there is going to be an increase in expenditure on education by the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You may disagree with that. You may have some inside knowledge or a different view of how the figures add up. But the opportunity provided here is for you to convince, in this case, if you do not want this bill to be passed, Senator Harradine and the Australian Democrats&mdash;although I suspect they have made up their minds; I certainly gather they have, from <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6329"> what Senator Allison says&mdash;the two Greens and Senator Colston.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is not going to change its mind on this. We think we are on the right track. We think we have made the appropriate policy change, and it is, as I say, relatively small. I thought Senator Allison was a little bit ungracious in saying that I say that it is nothing. I do not say that it is nothing at all. But I do say that it is relatively small&mdash;on our calculations, just over three per cent if you look at it in terms of the SPPs and less than one per cent if you look at it in total, SPPs and FAGs. You disagree with that, but this is your opportunity to convince other senators.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask again: is it not the case that, because the Commonwealth moneys under the present administrative arrangements are funded on a per capita basis for recurrent moneys, the money already follows the students? There are current arrangements in place under your terms. Further, is it not a reality that what this is about is saving the Commonwealth money&mdash;not providing choice, not providing greater flexibility, but saving the Commonwealth money?</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(9.15 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator, you understand, I understand and everyone understands what per capita funding is. That is why I was very grateful that you agreed to put on the amendments to the then Aboriginal education special initiatives program legislation, now referred to as the indigenous education special initiatives program legislation. I remember going over to you to thank you very much for doing that, because we have shifted to per capita funding and I thought that that was very important. Just as an aside, yesterday we signed the first agreement with a school, the Yiyili Aboriginal Community School&mdash;I am not sure how you pronounce that&mdash;in northern Western Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all understand what per capita funding means, that more students mean more money, fewer students mean less money. That is in the SPP. What you are not looking at is the FAGs, and you are also not taking account of the cost shifting the states are engaging in. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> That is what you are, in a sense, seeking to ignore. We believe that by implementing an EBA there is an incentive for the state governments to recognise the cost shifting they have been engaging in and to do what they can to ensure that the shift that is happening as a consequence of parental choice does not continue. We are not running around telling people to shift their kids into private schools. It is a function of parental choice.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="NEAL" NAMEID="B36">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="B36">Senator Neal</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But by making the schools smaller you are promoting it.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator, your party was in government for 13 years, and it is previous governments' policies that have encouraged parents to make the choice they have made. Parents have looked at schools and how they have ended up as a consequence of previous government policies&mdash;I accept not just federal government but state government as well&mdash;and they have made choices. This is not a sudden choice parents are making as a consequence of a change in government in March. It is not that at all. People were already making that choice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Neal's party would seek to say that we can ignore that. We do not think we can. We think we have to recognise there is some cost shifting here, that parents are making these choices and that there have to be changes as a consequence. The changes are small&mdash;as I have indicated, on the calculations we have, around three per cent of SPPs and only one per cent if we look at the total funding. We do not think people can say this is a significant change which is a disaster. It is not a disaster at all. It is a very sensible recognition. It is a small change, yes, but significant in the sense that it is a recognition, we believe, of the cost shifting that has been going on. We think it is an appropriate change to make.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I accept that Senator Neal's party does not think that. We have a difference of opinion. We believe that the cost shifting is inappropriate and we need a mechanism that properly reflects the choices that parents are making&mdash;and there has been this choice. I cannot easily articulate for the chamber in one or two sentences why parents have apparently been making these choices. Perhaps Senator Carr <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6330"> might like to indicate why he thinks parents have been making these choices, why so many people from the Labor Party send their kids to private schools and why so many people in the Australian Democrats either taught at or went to private schools. That is a matter of parental choice, and there would be different reasons on all occasions.</PARA>

<TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some people have to.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Panizza says, some have to. Some people who live in the country may want their kids to go to a city school and, rather than have them boarding privately with a family, they send them to a boarding school. There are all sorts of different reasons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think the new schools policy as established by the previous government was harsh. We think it is wrong that people who so desperately want to make a different choice for their children in education send them to a school that does not have Commonwealth funding because the new schools policy will not allow it. We think that is wrong. We think we have to be responsive to what parents want&mdash;not dictatorial about but responsive to what they want. We think it is wrong there are schools like that. That is why we want to get rid of the new schools policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think governments, not just federal but state as well, should be responsive to choices parents want to make. Of course there are some basics in education where state and federal governments have to draw the line, but the choices parents want to make about where they send their kids to school and what it is they think is important that their kids get in primary and second schooling are not things we should be, in a monetary sense, trying to limit with a policy like the previous government's new schools policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we came into government we looked at the situation and found people are making this choice, that they are wanting to shift their children to private schools, non-government schools. Senator Neal, Senator Carr and Senator Allison might be able to tell me&mdash;I would like to hear these words from Senator Allison's mouth&mdash;why it is that parents are making these choices, why the federal government should simply ignore this trend and why <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> it is we should ignore the cost shifting by the states. Why should the federal government allow the states to engage in this cost shifting and not make a change?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the arguments I would like to hear. I understand there is a difference of opinion in a policy sense and that senators opposite will be critical of what the government wants to do. But what I would like to hear are reasons why we should ignore parental choice and why this has happened. Senators opposite seem to have a view that this government is somehow opposed to government schools. That is not right at all. It is not us making the choices about where children go. It is the parents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would be very happy to hear some views about that from members opposite&mdash;that is, if in fact we have the time. The bottom line is that we are nearing the end of the session, we have a number of bills before us and it is simply a case of deciding whether we do or do not agree with this. Perhaps I am being irresponsible in inviting those opposite to give me those comments. Perhaps we could discuss it over a couple of Christmas drinks. I am just trying to indicate the position I am coming from&mdash;that I do not understand why you have this view. But I accept that you do, that you are not going to change your mind and that you are going to vote against this.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to put a statement to you and ask you to tell me whether this is right or wrong. The enrolment benchmark adjustment deducts from state schools' budgets $1,712 for each new student in the private sector over the current enrolment proportion and, on the government's own projections, this sum is $305 million over four years.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has made its position very clear with respect to the enrolment benchmark adjustment.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just want to emphasise that this whole debate, which took place some time earlier in the week and which we are now repeating, relates to less than one per cent, we believe, of total funding for schools when you look at SPPs and FAGs.

The New South Wales officials say that this approach is incorrect and unsound. They are supported by every government in the Commonwealth. Every state government says that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The costs included in the average costs incorporate school executive funding, staff development funding, school administrative funding, general school running costs and all non&hyphen;school based administration, as well as the costs of providing teachers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of the states contend that the Commonwealth cannot and must not use average costs as the basis for calculating cost savings to the states where students transfer to the non-government sector.

You <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> said that it was insignificant, and I am glad that you corrected that calculation. It is not one per cent; it is three per cent. The effect of the EBA&mdash;this has been verified by the department&mdash;will be to cost every student remaining in state schools $140 over the four-year period. That is in fact not one per cent or three per cent. To those students, that represents an eight per cent cut in recurrent grants. I need to say that there is in fact very little that is new in terms of extra money for programs in this budget. It is something that you claim, nevertheless.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Possibly, the government is resting on its additional $145 million for literacy in making these claims. This additional $145 million for literacy represents just $14 per student over three years, or $4.66 per student per year. I am drawing on those figures just to get the EBA into perspective. We are talking here about $140 per student remaining in government schools, compared with what you make a great deal about: the $4.66 per student per year for literacy, for instance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is important that senators understand the effect of the EBA out there in the real world. I want you to understand that this mechanism means that, even if state schools maintain their numbers, their share of enrolments decreases, they will lose money under the mechanism. I think we have made that pretty clear this morning. It is not a policy difference and it is not an academic debate. This is about the very simple fact that, even if the numbers of real children in real state schools stay the same, those schools still lose money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To assist senators to understand what is going on out there in the real world, I thought I would bring in some of the many hundreds of letters that I have received from schools. This one is from Ogilvie High School, in New Town Tasmania. The letter states, in part:</PARA>

<PARA>A letter from Runcorn Heights State School states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To take more money away from state schools is simply absurd. Our P.&amp;C. Association is continually under great pressure to raise money to make up the shortfall when Government grants money does not cover all it is meant to cover. Our school population stems from middle to lower class poorer families who are not always able to contribute to fund raising plans and so our children are the ones who suffer in the long term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">At our school we have over&hyphen;crowded classes. At one stage this year we had 32 students in one year one class and 32 in another year one class. Paint is peeling from the buildings and from the walls inside the tuckshop. The student desks and chairs are the ones that were originally supplied when the school was opened twenty one years ago. We are desperately trying to raise the money required to enclose our under covered area so it can be utilised fully.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a school council we feel there are a lot of other areas that would benefit from this money. Parents who choose to send their children to non government schools pay yearly fees. These non government schools should not be given more funding than government schools particularly if this money is to be taken away from government schools.</PARA>
<PARA>That is just a small selection of the numerous pieces of correspondence that have come into my office over the past few weeks. This is why the Democrats are saying that this mechanism is unfair and it is, in fact, dangerous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the hearing, I asked DEETYA to prepare a table showing the overall effect of the enrolment benchmark adjustment on the basis of a non-government proportion increase, and there were five different stages: 31.1 per cent, which I understand is projected until the end of the year 2000; 33 per cent; 35 per cent; 40 per cent; and 50 per cent. I seek leave to table a copy of that table.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this table shows is that at 31.1 per cent we see a per student deduction of $42. If the $406 SPPs to each student were to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6336"> remain the same&mdash;and this is theoretical, of course, but it does give some indication of the direction that we are talking about with this EBA&mdash;at 31.1 per cent, $42 would be deducted from that grant. That would leave $364. At 33 per cent, which is not all that much higher&mdash;and if we proceeded, even under the current new schools policy, we would probably expect that to increase over the next three years to 33.3 per cent&mdash;we would get a $91 decrease. If it rose to 35 per cent, we would get a $147 decrease. That would bring down that figure to $259. When it reached 40 per cent, we would be looking at a $301 decrease. That would leave $105.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the figure rose to 50 per cent&mdash;I doubt very much that it would, but I asked for this calculation to be done so that we could get some understanding of what this EBA might mean in the longer term, and we have to remember that we do not have any projections beyond the year 2000 for the EBA&mdash;with the government sector having 1.5 million students, they would, in fact, be paying back the Commonwealth government at $295 per student. That is the effect of the EBA. It continues to take money out of the states. It continues to punish the states for the enrolments in the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we did reach that position&mdash;and I am not suggesting we will&mdash;we would have a situation where the states would be obliged to pay the Commonwealth government $469 million. That is clearly absurd. I think it is not beyond the realms of possibility that we would reach that 50 per cent. It just shows how unfair and how absurd that whole notion of punishing for policy reasons is: one sector is punished as a result of the increase in another.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs trots out the old familiar story that the states have been cost shifting. We have heard that again this morning. Now a figure of $3 billion is being tossed around, and we understand that goes back to 1983. A 13-year-old piece of mathematics would not seem to me to be all that useful and, of course, it is not substantiated like most other claims of this nature. There is no explanation either. We are, nevertheless, told that we have to accept that the states have <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> been doing all this cost shifting. I am not sure where the money has gone. It certainly has not gone to education as those letters, which I have already quoted from, point out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is probably about as relevant to today's debate as the $2.3 billion extra which the government says is being spent over the next four years. I refer to the tables in the report of the committee. There are two tables. There is one prepared by the department on page 14 and there is another on page 67, which has more or less the same figures but which has some calculations that draw upon those figures. Compared with spending in 1996, these figures on page 14&mdash;the calculations are not done for us, unfortunately, but I am happy to expand on them, because I have done the adding up myself&mdash;show that there is a budget increase of $96 million for government schools and $530 million for private schools in additional funds over the next four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I seek clarification, or at least acknowledgment, from the department that this is the case. All I have done is take the year 2000 in the last column and compared that with 1996, which I gather is what the government wants us to do in calculating their additional funding. I have also looked at the same figure for non-government schools. Compared with spending in 1996, the specific purpose payments show a budget increase of $96 million for government schools and $530 million for private schools over the next four years. This adds up to an increase for both sectors of $626 million. My question to the minister and the department is this: if it is $626 million, and they are your figures, where does the $2.3 billion come from?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister and the department have acknowledged in answers to questions in the estimates process and this chamber that they are planning to cut Commonwealth expenditure on government schools by $87 million over the next four years. In addition, the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6338"> government has cut financial assistance grants to the states by $1.5 billion over three years. How can the minister expect the states, in this context in which the government is providing less money, to spend more on schooling? Given the history of these matters, research that we have undertaken through the parliamentary research service and taking into account the rise in the schools cost index, the states have been spending considerably less in terms of outlays for schooling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> As a percentage of the total budget sector, their priorities for education have declined. Education's percentage of total budget outlays in the state of Victoria has declined from 26.8 per cent in 1989&hyphen;90 to 18 per cent in 1993&hyphen;94. This is a pattern which occurs across Labor and Liberal governments: that states are actually spending less on education. This government is cutting money to the states.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think what we have been speaking about this morning is completely relevant. We are talking about removing the EBA. So discussion about whether or not the $2.3 billion is extra or it is some other figure is relevant because it is crucial to the government's argument. The government says the EBA is insignificant; that it is only one per cent or three per cent and so, because there is so much other funding going into education, we need not worry about it. I want to come back to that $96 million to state schools. I also did a calculation which showed that it was an increase of 1.7 per cent over four years. That is something like 0.4 per cent each year in that period. I would like to suggest that 0.4 per cent is not an increase because I would imagine it does not even begin to cover inflation over that period. On the other hand, $530 million to private schools is 6.27 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister said on 7 November that `funding per government school pupil will rise, taking these assumptions into account, to 17.9 per cent compared with non&hyphen;government per&hyphen;capita increases of 14.9 per cent'. So here we have another set of differences in terms of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6339"> the figures that the department produces and the figures plucked from the air by the government during this debate. I mention that again: $96 million to state schools is an increase of 1.7 per cent over four years, hardly enough to keep up with inflation. Five hundred and thirty million dollars goes to private schools&mdash;that is 6.27 per cent. However you, Minister, said that funding to government school pupils would rise, taking these assumptions into account, to 17.9 per cent, compared with non&hyphen;government, per&hyphen;capita increases of 14.9 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Now, you have actually made some calculations on the basis of the FAGs to the states and you have said that, all right, we are going to increase government school expenditure only by 1.7 per cent but we will assume that the states will increase their funding by 20.18 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For some reason, given that these are untied grants, given that $1.5 billion has been taken away from the FAGs over this period, you have assumed that the states will increase their spending on schools by 20.18 per cent. I directed a question on notice, question No. 39, to the department during the hearings about the guarantees in terms of states agreeing to fund education. The answer was that the decision at the 1996 Premiers Conference was that the states and territories would contribute to deficit reduction. DEETYA has no indication that states and territories have reduced their financial effort in schools as a consequence of this decision at the Premiers Conference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You might argue, `Well, they didn't say they wouldn't. Therefore, that means they did, and they did to the tune of 20 per cent.' I think this stretches our credibility a long way. Even if you take into account those percentage increases, it still does not add up to the figures that you have produced. You have said that essentially government school pupils will have increases to their per capita funding at a greater rate than the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> That simply does not wash, and I return to the table on page 14. The percentage increase of the FAGs to both government and non-government schools is the same&mdash;20.18 per cent. But the percentage increase to govern ment schools is very different. It is 1.7 per cent to government schools and 6.27 per cent to non-government schools. It is another indication that the government is using figures to promote its policy, but it is misleading. I think it has caused a great deal of confusion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You also said on 27 November that additional Commonwealth funding of $2.3 billion, which will be available for government schools, comes from two sources: firstly, the specific purpose payments to government schools and, secondly, the Commonwealth sourced financial assistance grants. I assume that you still stand by that comment, but I refer you once again to this table prepared by DEETYA which quite clearly shows otherwise. Either the government is trying to confuse people with the figures or there is simply not the understanding of the effects of that EBA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that you do not know whether there is an increase in funds or not and, if you do, then people are being misled. I invite you to respond to that. Perhaps you will need to do some calculations. The problem with the tables that we have been presented with is that there are no additions across the line. We are simply presented with year by year figures. What has consistently happened is that those calculations are not being done. We cannot see comparisons from one year to the next. We do not see comparisons with the year 2000 and the year 1996. We do not see the adding up, except where it suits the government's purposes. So I ask you to address that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I draw your attention to page 9 of the departmental submission, which I think is a pretty similar table to the one you are referring to. It shows how the calculations have been made. You are pretty loose sometimes with your comments. I noticed a little earlier that you said you were pleased I had corrected an assessment of the impact of the EBA from one to three. That is not the case. Each time I have referred to that, I have indicated that we calculate that to be about three per cent of SPPs or one per cent of FAGs and SPPs together. That has been perfectly clear, but you choose to flippantly say, probably because we are on broadcast, `You have changed your story on that.' Where the story does change, it needs to be acknowledged, but, where it has not, it is not appropriate for you to flippantly suggest that it has.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that in your earlier remarks you indicated that somehow the government was offering different figures from those which the department offered. I think your terminology was something like `You have plucked things out of the air'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That in fact was in the departmental submission. There is no difference between the government and the department on these figures, and certainly not one that has become clear to me as a consequence of anything you have said.

We are seeking to replace division 3, 19, `Powers of Minister if amounts of grants become repayable', to ensure that the provisions for the recouping of money for fraud or for any other breaches of the law will be maintained.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that time is getting on and we will be seeking to take this matter to a division very shortly, but I put this view to you, Minister: during the term of the previous government, direct school funding rose by some 58 per cent in real terms. Yet, largely due to the actions of state governments, Australia's ranking amongst OECD countries in terms of spending on school education remained very low.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the election your party told us that it was concerned about this. Minister, do you expect that the measures that you have outlined in this proposal&mdash;which involve the reduction in Commonwealth expenditure for government schools in terms of direct payments by some $87 million over the next four years and the reduction, one can conclude, in terms of the implications of the reductions in Commonwealth government grants to the states of $1.5 billion over the three years&mdash;which take further money from the states, are likely to encourage them to spend more money on schools?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation has given you the opportunity to demonstrate national leadership&mdash;the vehicle by which governments in recent times have been able to provide the platform for the expression of their concerns about the direction for education in this country. The issue of national leadership is in itself of national significance in terms of education. Minister, why have you made your budget bottom line more important than the future of young Australians? Why have you broken your promise on this very vital issue? Instead of discussing with the states this whole question of expenditure by all governments of school <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> education in a mature way, you have imposed these cuts arbitrarily, without warning and without any regard to the problems you yourself identified before the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You told the Australian people as a party that, in government, you would be concerned about the way in which the states have reduced funding. You told the Australian people that you would do something about it. What you have done is in fact reduce funding for education, particularly for public education, by $87 million over the next four years in terms of the moneys you directly control. You have reduced financial assistance grants to the states by $1.5 billion over three years and changed the calculation of the way in which road funding and other measures have been added to the FAGs.

The simple fact of the matter is: your government, during the election, refused to open the books to the Australian people. We were perfectly willing to have the books opened and policies on both sides assessed and reassessed on the basis of the books. Your government simply refused to open the books&mdash;an absolutely flat refusal. On coming to government, we found this enormous fiscal irresponsibility. There is nothing to be gained and there are no friends to be won in putting a budget back into black. There is no pleasure in saying to people, `You're going to get less money. We're going to have to tighten this up. We can't continue with this program.' Cleaning up a mess that a previous government made is not a politician's dream. Oh, no! It is not the land of milk and honey, coming into government and having to fix up a mess that the previous government created.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the situation that this government is in. Let us make no bones about it. The previous government made an unholy mess of running this country. That is why, after a very significant time in office, you lost government so comprehensively. The new government is prepared to fix that mess, to make those hard decisions. We are not going to walk away from the tough decisions that became too hard for an ageing government to make. Too many people in the previous government had never experienced opposition. They just waltzed into a party that was in government and had the mentality of spend, spend, spend other people's money, taxpayers' money, low&hyphen;income&hyphen;earning taxpayers' money, without regard for the consequences. The consequences of that are fairly clear, with such <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> lagging employment growth as was generated in the last few years of your government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You referred to the bottom line of a budget disparagingly, as if, somehow, it is dirty work to put a government's budget back into black. I do not regard that as dirty work, Senator. I regard it as a job that has to be done, because previous governments were simply unprepared to do it. I can see the benefits of a nation that does have some fiscal responsibility. When everyone else has to keep their budgets in order, I do not see why a cabinet here should simply play with other people's money as though they are in a sandpit, without any regard for the responsibility that they bear, being the government, and the consequences of simply spend, spend, spend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You may have the view, Senator, that when you are in government it is other people's money and you can do what you like with it, but we do not. We regard putting the budget back into black as not an easy task and not a pleasant task. It is never fun to go to people and say, `We're going to have to tighten up,' but that is the task we were elected to do. Weakly walking away from that task, as Old Jellyback and others did, means you walk away from the most disadvantaged people in the community. It means you walk away from the people who do not have a job, who are not sitting in here taking up extensive amounts of time and money rehashing debates over and over again, self&hyphen;indulgently. It means walking away from the lowest skilled people who are most at risk when you are in a recession. That is what it means. They are the sorts of people you walk away from: the small business people with large overdrafts and people with extensive mortgages trying to buy their own homes. You just leave the fiscal mess, let the interest rates rise, and walk away from those people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can imagine no government policy which can put as much money back into people's pockets as a reduction in interest rates does. How does that come about? It does not come about because a government spends willy&hyphen;nilly and does not give a damn about the black line, putting the budget back into black. We are very pleased to have seen some interest rate reductions which have put real <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6343"> money back into people's pockets&mdash;no more of the previous government's policy of `We'll give you more money,' and turning a blind eye to the fact that they lost it all in any event through high interest rates and high taxes. I do place some importance on getting the budget back into black and the positive consequences that flow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me make it abundantly clear: yes, we said that funding of schooling is vitally important. I have repeated time and time again in here how we have made the calculations, that, on the specific purpose payments and financial assistance grants to the states, funding for government schools is going up. We can argue about this EBA, which is less than one per cent, we calculate, of total funding for schools&mdash;SPPs and FAGs together&mdash;and about three per cent of just SPPs. We can argue about that policy issue, but let us not pretend that somehow education is being ripped apart, when the bottom line is that total moneys are going up and the contribution from this portion of this portfolio to the savings task has been minimal, in recognition of the very important place that primary and secondary education takes in the mind of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me also come back, just briefly, Senator Alison, to this in particular. I know you understand what a first reading is. It is just a bill being introduced. I presume you understand what a second reading is. We spent three hours and 56 minutes in a second reading on the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 1996. That is not a bad thing because education is important. On the committee stage, at 10.15 a.m. we had spent about two hours and 54 minutes and we still have not had a vote on one of the clauses in the committee. We can go on indulging ourselves if we like, but it is abundantly clear to me, from the second reading debate and from the committee stages that we had in previous weeks, and from when this bill was referred to a committee, that you do understand how this works and you simply disagree. For some reason, you think it is appropriate to drag this committee stage out. I do not know whether you think anybody is going to change their mind as a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> consequence of your repeating your speeches in the second reading debate, but it is my view that they are not.</PARA>

I am referring, of course, to the mining corporations who said, `Give us $800 million that is not allowed under the budget as a diesel fuel rebate.' The government went weak at the knees immediately. That is $800 million. Yet the minister is here trying to defend the indefensible cuts to public education in this country. You might say they are not. We will say they are.

<PARA>Amendment No. 2 goes to the issue of the government's rationale for funding of non-government schools&mdash;that is, it seeks to explain that government schools are somehow or other an alternative. This is a view that the Labor Party does not support. We believe that, on the issue of choice, private schooling is an addition, not an alternative, in terms of providing reasonable access to quality government schooling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been a fundamental principle of public schooling in this country that public schooling is primarily the responsibility of the public sector through governments. Since the education acts of last century, the various public instruction acts, all governments have acknowledged their responsibilities to provide comprehensive education available on a universal basis. Of course, many have said that it should be free, secular and universal. There may well be some argument as to what is the meaning of `free' in its modern context, but that principle has been firmly grounded in public administration in the Commonwealth throughout this century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are seeking to put in perspective the rhetoric about choice and we would like to emphasise to the chamber the role of the Commonwealth in underpinning a national quality public education system&mdash;and providing financial assistance also to the non-government sector, but not at the expense of the public sector. It is our belief that choice <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6348"> exists only if there is a quality, universally accessible government school system. What we maintain is that the choice of some should not be at the expense of the choice of many.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we argue and what Professor McKinnon highlighted is that there is a limit to the resources available. There are finite limits on resources available and we cannot logically argue that choice can be so broad as to fund every possible option of every group no matter how small or how isolated in terms of a private education system. In terms of our social responsibility, we have to primarily consider responsibilities to provide a high quality, universally accessible public education system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Professor McKinnon argued, I think very competently, in the review he undertook, which was finally published in April 1996&mdash;a review, of course, which the government has sought to shelve, tried to bury in the bottom drawer, sought to avoid public discussion on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Choice is easier to use as a rhetorical term than it is to operationalise, at least for the funding of schools. Generalised support for the concept of everyone having maximum choice does not translate into a system which can realistically fund all conceivable options. Nor is choice an unambiguous good.</PARA>
<PARA>The minority report, in considering these issues, argued that there is a significant weakness in the policy upon which the states grants bill is predicated, because it is meant to provide for the financial assistance to primary and secondary schools, but it does so with the notions of parental choice as its overarching purpose rather than as a general purpose directed towards educational outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> It has been repeated by several witnesses before the committee that choice in itself has no impact on educational outcomes in terms of Australian schools. It is likely, however, that the deliberate favouring of private provision over public provision in our schools could quickly lead to a deterioration in the quality and the universality of public education, and hence our amendments seek to reinstate the basic principle that the central point held in common by all Commonwealth governments of all political persuasions over the last two decades is that its primary re sponsibility is to support the provision of a comprehensive universal education system so that Australians, no matter where they live, have access to high quality educational services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That cannot be done through the privatisation of education, because it is founded upon a whole series of different principles. It is not comprehensive. It does not seek to be comprehensive. Individual schools are established on the basis of the values that they see reflected in a particular group. For the disabled it cannot possibly be contended that there is comprehensive provision in private education. Time and again it has been put to Senate estimates committees, particularly for the disabled, the disadvantaged and a whole range of others, that choice is not really an option, because the private sector does not provide it. We will speak more about that when we come to the issues relating to broadbanding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments seek to recognise Australia's international treaty signatory obligations. They seek to identify that the primary role of government is to ensure that the quality of services is maintained at a high level for all Australians and that Australians, particularly if they come from backgrounds where they cannot afford private education and the provision of private fees and tuition, are not singled out for reduced services or isolated by the withdrawal of public support.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats support these amendments. We think these amendments place at least some restrictions on where schools can open, what their minimum number of enrolments should be, how viable they should be and what curriculum requirements should be put in place. They also set up a process under which the minister is obliged to take advice from state based non-government school planning committees. Those committees, in the Democrats' view, are appropriately structured under the opposition amendments and they are consistent with the notion that all parties should be involved in planning Australian schooling.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That really is the key to these amendments: there should be planning and it should happen <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6349"> with the involvement of all parties. It is important to draw on some of the submissions to the inquiry in support of that. One is from the National Catholic Education Commission. It sought to persuade the government to set up some general principles for planning schools. For instance, it says that, since the Commonwealth government has a shared responsibility for the funding of education, it has a right and a responsibility in regard to new schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It offered as a suggestion for a minimum in terms of the process of consultation that proponents of new schools gain access to demographic and planning data at the state and territory level; consultative meetings between two or more education providers or from time to time between all peak provider bodies; the exchange of relevant information between peak school education authorities to avoid the overprovision of facilities by any one of the three providers; knowledge of other broad plans to help individual school systems; and provider planning. So it is not just the public sector which is arguing that sensible planning processes ought to be in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it would be appropriate at this stage to ask the government what it is going to do to ensure that there will be some sort of uniformity across the states when it comes to minimum registration requirements. Does the government accept that it is in the national interest to have uniformity in an area of such national significance as education? We heard at the inquiry the range of different registration requirements the states have. Many states said they thought they would need to develop their own planning requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I would like to ask the minister is along those lines. Are you asking the Senate to pass this bill with absolutely no idea of what agreements the states will develop themselves and whether or not the Commonwealth government will be part of that process? What sort of standards and requirements might there be at the end of such a process? I know that the government has said over and over again that it thinks that education is a state responsibility.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the delights of a federal system is that if the Commonwealth does something, it is responsible and it has to answer to the electorate for it on each occasion. Similarly, when a state government chooses to implement a policy, it is answerable for that policy to the people of that state. We do not think it is appropriate that the Commonwealth maintain the Commonwealth new schools policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think it is just plain wrong that there can be a policy which seeks to discourage parental choice in schooling. It is acknowledged in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that Senator Carr was referring to and has referred to before by highlighting that everyone has a right to education. He has not gone on and pointed out that point 3 of article 26 says that parents have a prior right to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6350"> choose the kind of education that shall be given to their children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that the previous government's new schools policy&mdash;that is, the existing new schools policy&mdash;inhibits that choice very substantially. We think it is wrong that there are schools that do not have Commonwealth funding. Parents have been desperate to have an alternative choice and the Commonwealth is not funding them. We think that is wrong. We think parents should have the choice. They are entitled to some Commonwealth funding when they make that choice to move away. You might not think that. You might think they are only entitled to such choices as you are prepared to give them. We would like to give them greater choice than the new schools policy allowed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the fact that the new schools policy was set up to try to inhibit the growth of new non-government schools, they, nonetheless, grew. That is in the face of a very difficult policy climate. Non-government schools, nonetheless, kept springing up. That should tell you something, Senator. It should tell you that parents want to make that choice. That is why we believe it is appropriate to get rid of the new schools policy at a Commonwealth level because at a Commonwealth level we say that we are not interested in doing that. We do not want to inhibit parental choice. If a state wants to take it up and they want to argue the case with the parents in their state and they want to inhibit the parents' choice, let them do so.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A number of schools did not receive funding under the new schools policy. I do not have the figures right here in front of me, but it was a considerable number.

They did not receive funding because of the effect that the opening of that school would have on neighbouring Catholic, other non&hyphen;government and state schools. They did not receive funding because they could not demonstrate that they were viable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that they are reasonable expectations to have. What you are concluding is that all non&hyphen;government schools will not be irresponsible. By saying to me that I am saying non&hyphen;government schools will be irresponsible, you are suggesting that the assumption you and the federal government make is that they will be responsible. I think, on the whole, that that is not an unreasonable suggestion. However, I would have thought that, since it is taxpayers' money, the federal government ought to have the ability to know that the states are responsible. Under this legislation it will not be able to do that. So it is a question of accountability. I do not think you can say that the states are accountable. It is Commonwealth funding, and the Commonwealth ought to have a say in whether or not it is getting value for that money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are talking here about efficiency and cost effectiveness, yet we are handing over enormous sums of money to people and to organisations from which the government has absolutely no power to demand that accountability. I suggest to you that that is not responsible and not a reasonable way to deal with such crucial national issues as education. You say it is the states' matter, but thus far the Commonwealth government has taken a role in planning at the national level. Through its programs and through its other mechanisms it said that there is a responsibility at that level. I think it is disappointing to see that the Commonwealth government is prepared to step aside from that.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6352">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is also disappointing is that this is not about outcomes. It is not about things like retention rates. We do not know how they will be affected by this legislation. I turn to another table prepared by the department for the inquiry. This table looks at retention rates and shows that there are huge differences between government and non-government schools. I dare say we could have a debate about why that is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation does not seek to address education outcomes. It seeks to open up the private sector without any controls. It does not assist in providing a better education for either the non-government or the government sector because there will be some non-government schools affected by this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly, the Catholic system will be one of those affected. The Catholic system has grown at a consistent and small rate over the years. It is a properly planned system. It does not open up schools with one, two or six students. It does its own planning and that has been healthy for education in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are talking about here in an unplanned expansion&mdash;and that is what the government is doing&mdash;is very small schools starting up. I referred to this in a speech I made on Wednesday. The point is that the Commonwealth no longer has any control. We cannot say that we do not need a school here or that we do. We cannot say that, if a new school opens up in a small country town, the effect of it will be to take students from government schools and the effect of that will be for the state government to close down those schools because they are no longer viable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have already mentioned that in Victoria our state government has changed its requirements for its own schools. Now it will close another 113 schools because they do not have enough enrolments. It has changed its enrolment requirement&mdash;it has doubled it in some cases&mdash;and so schools will close down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, the minimum enrolments the Victorian government has are very low for non-government schools. In every other state in Australia there are no minimums, so we can have schools starting up with one or two students and they will attract $2,000 per <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> student from the Commonwealth.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to the concept of minimum enrolments, which you would expect to have some relationship to the issue of financial viability, the states as a rule do not have criteria. There is one state that does&mdash;Victoria. It has a substantially different criteria for private sector enrolments and private sector enrolments, by a factor of some 40 to one. There is a minimum requirement of 10 in a private primary school and 400 in a public school. That sort of inconsistency and hypocrisy is just breathtaking.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In relation to the issue of the performance of the states, I think there are two issues that we need to look at. If we look at the requirements of the states for registration, your state of South Australia, Minister, has no official requirement. It relies upon the new schools policy. It may review that; it may not. New South Wales has no requirement. Queensland is in the same position as your state. Western Australia has no requirement. Tasmania has a requirement for a minimum of two for families, and I guess that means a minimum of two students. The ACT has no <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6354"> requirement, and the Northern Territory has a slightly more complex provision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we look at the list of unfunded or part-funded schools that your department, in answer to a question 19 in estimates, communicated to us, in your state of South Australia there are no schools that are totally unfunded. There are two schools that are category six limitation funded. So, in effect, the new schools policy has restricted funding but not stopped funding of any school. There are no schools operating&mdash;according to the answer that DEETYA gave us to question No. 19&mdash;that are totally unfunded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at that same document, it appears to me that the overwhelming majority of schools that are unfunded are in the states of New South Wales, Western Australia and Queensland. I think they are the states&mdash;according to the information that I have as to the requirements for registration&mdash;that have no minimum number requirement. So we have a correlation that, where there is no minimum requirement for the number of pupils, there is a higher number of unfunded schools. This bill removes any restriction on funding. So those schools will be funded because there is no requirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the persistent stance of this government is, `We don't have money. We can't splash money around everywhere.' There are limitations. We have this alleged black hole. At the same time, there is going to be no financial stringency applied in relation to these schools, whereas there is now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the schools that are established in the non-government sector, I think the evidence is that, prior to the new schools policy where there was no limitation on funding, a number of schools opened were not viable and closed. I think the evidence in relation to that was the evidence from the Independent Education Union, Minister, which talked about a concern for the destabilising effect that these non-viable schools had on some of the smaller communities. They mentioned communities in rural and regional New South Wales, in particular.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that these provisions in the bill will see us re&hyphen;embark upon the course that existed prior to 1985. It has not. So I think it <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> would be interesting to get the minister's view as to whether the situation which existed prior to 1985 is the situation that this bill seeks to obtain. If the experience prior to 1985 was not satisfactory to the Commonwealth or to at least some participants in the sector, why should we be rushing to pass a measure now, given that there is clearly no common view amongst the states about the need to pursue this measure at this time?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would seem that, if there is a desire for some sort of consultative federalism on such an important issue, it would be more appropriate to obtain through meetings of state and federal ministers some consistency and some agreement. This is far from unheard of. There are many policy areas in which this has occurred. It would seem that there would be a more rational and reasonable approach to this issue to pursue agreement on these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand, Minister, that you are saying, `Well, it's all a matter for the states,' but there are very great financial implications for the states. I would describe this particular measure as a risk strategy&mdash;one could be more unkind and say that it is a strategy to visit any odium on the states and not on the Commonwealth&mdash;in that the government is taking a risk that the outcome will be satisfactory to the Australian people.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will give more information, if you like. I will go through them for you from here on rather than perhaps go back. The Launceston Rudolf Steiner School has 11 primary school students. You may think that is inappropriate, but they are unfunded. The Somerset Baptist Christian School also has unfunded students. The Kingston Christian Community School has unfunded secondary students. The Geneva Baptist School that I referred to has some unfunded secondary students. Senator O'Brien quite rightly points out that in my state the effect of the new schools policy is simply to limit two schools to category 6.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will not go through all of them because I am conscious of the time. I do not want to take up the time of senators unduly. Let us shift to the state of Queensland.

Senator O'Brien may say that that is not a problem, but if you are category 6 and you want to be category 7, I imagine that it would be of some interest to you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Cape Flattery Silica Mines School has seven students. Cape Flattery via Cooktown is a fair way away. I do not see why, if in that very isolated area people want to have a particular school, it should be unfunded because of this policy. The Christian Outreach College at Gympie has funded primary students but unfunded secondary students. You might say that the Cooloola Christian College is another one that has money and is a category 6 school. However, its proposed category is category 9. The Faith Christian College at Pialba has unfunded primary and secondary school students. The Glenden Christian School at Glenden is an unfunded school.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Harmony Montessori school at Buderim is an unfunded school. The Hinchinbrook Christian School is an unfunded school.

The Noosa Pengari Steiner School is an unfunded school. The Norman Park Christian school is an unfunded school. The Peace Christian Community School at Rockhampton has a category 6 limitation. We believe that it should be in category 8.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You do not seem to care about all these things. You seem to think the parents who have made the choice to send their kids to the Peace Christian Community School at Rockhampton, for example, because of the previous government's schools policy, deserve to be limited to category 6 funding and should <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6356"> not be shifted to category 8. You do not think anything of that. You think it is just tough luck for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">St Stephens College in Coomera is limited to category 6. The School of Total Education has some unfunded students, although I admit that it does not have many unfunded students. The Sinai College has a category 6 limitation. We think it should be category 7. The Tambourine Mountain College is an unfunded school. The Glennie School at Toowoomba has unfunded students. It does not have many but, nonetheless, it does have some, and they are primary school students. The Toowoomba Christian College has unfunded students and a category 6 limitation. We think it should otherwise be in category 8.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will come back to the schools Senator O'Brien mentioned that are in my state. He seemed to say that the Heritage College at Oakden and the Horizon Christian School have money. They are limited to category 6, but are proposed to be category 11 or 12. It is not as though this category 6 limitation is something that you can easily ignore. I referred to the Yealering Aboriginal community school this morning in response to Senator Carr's inquiry about the impact of shifting to per capita funding. I was pleased to sign an agreement with them under the IESIP funding. It has some unfunded students in relation to these matters, as does the Yallingup Steiner School at Yallingup and St Andrews Grammar School at Dianella.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Parents are entitled to make these choices. We believe it is fair enough that these schools are entitled to some funding. We think this new schools policy has operated to say, `You can have the choice, but we will not help you with it.' That is really not much choice at all. We think you should have the choice, and we will help in any event.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot speak with any specific knowledge of the Queensland situation but I did make the point earlier that there is no restriction on establishment by number of pupils in Queensland. That is the situation as I understand it. So it is hardly surprising that schools unrestrained by state regulation have sprung up. To the extent that there are many that are part&hyphen;funded <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that is probably an issue about whether you want to make changes to the new schools policy, particularly given their recommendations to change the new schools policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me turn to the issues you raise about the Tasmanian schools, Minister: you may not be aware but there have been significant reductions in the number of government schools in Tasmania on the grounds of financial restriction and the efficiency of the system on the basis announced by the government that some of the smaller schools were unable to supply a satisfactory educational experience because of their limited size. Points have been made by the representatives of various parts of the non&hyphen;government schools sector that they want to have curriculum standards set by the state and they want to be viable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suggest to you that two matters are under consideration here. The first matter is that there are schools which are currently established that are not fully funded, and there is the issue of whether any of those should be looked at again; and I suggest that looking at the new schools policy again was already being contemplated. There is a report. I think that our amendments have regard to some of those issues. So some of those schools that you have mentioned would, in fact, under our proposal receive additional funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the issue of establishing more schools, because that is what your policy will permit under the arrangements that now exist within the states, we will see in my state an erosion of the dollars which go to the government school sector. That is the sector that educates the vast majority of the pupils in Tasmania. So in an unrestrained environment, and given the current political climate in Tasmania&mdash;I think there is a degree of inertia with the Tasmanian government at the moment&mdash;we could not be confident that this matter would be addressed expeditiously. I am concerned that we may see an erosion, by the government not doing what it should, of the funding basis of the state schools by simply transferring money across to the non&hyphen;government schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have experienced a number of school closures in Tasmania; it was a very painful <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6357"> experience for the community. I make this prediction, Minister: if things occur in such a way as to cause further restriction of the funding of the government school sector, there will be a significant backlash. The philosophy behind this bill&mdash;allowing parents to send children to schools that they want&mdash;will have to be attended to and undermined by a state government in the interests of maintaining their sector. You say that is a political problem  for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thought the resolution of the state aid debate was about taking it out of the political area and getting a formula, an arrangement, by which all sectors could live. I take it from what your government is saying that you have no concern about that. So I think it is important to put on the record that, having no concern, you do not believe that will happen, and you may be right; frankly, I hope that you are because I think it will be a very painful experience in the community of Tasmania, and a lot of people will regret the passage of this legislation. That is why I think our amendments do attend to some of the problems that you mention but do not allow an open slather approach to the establishment of new schools. They are amendments which are worthy of very strong consideration.</PARA></SPEECH>

<STATE> (Victoria)</STATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Minister, you made some claims about the operations of the new schools policy. I refute those claims, particularly those claims relating to the question of financial viability and curriculum choice. The prospect of a high school operating with 20 students, or 50 students for that matter, providing the range of educational experiences that one can expect from modern teaching&mdash;any school having the financial resources with 50 students to offer that full range in terms of specialist teaching&mdash;seems to me to be patently obviously impossible to provide.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The notion that a small primary school with 10 students in it is an ideal that we should be striving for strikes me as inappropriate. We all know from our history the difficulties of one&hyphen;teacher schools in remote and isolated communities. This policy institutionalises those failings which, of course, were failings as a result of our geography and demography. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> They are not something to be applauded. The courage of teachers undertaking those duties in bygone days has to be acknowledged but it is not something we should be trying to aspire to in the 21st century because that is the pattern that is being established by this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since 1985 those seeking to establish new government schools have been required under the old policy, of course, to demonstrate the school satisfied a range of planning criteria and on that basis funds were made available by the Commonwealth. That policy provided the framework for planned educational provision across this country. And the states operated underneath that umbrella. You are proposing to take the umbrella away and then say to this chamber, `Well, we will rely on the states to plug up the gaps when the rain comes in.' That clearly just will not happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The political weakness of the position you are putting assumes that state governments will have the political will to undertake the necessary planning provision against some of these highly organised and very vocal religious groups in the main who will pursue a political agenda. I really question whether there will be the political courage at a state level to defend planned educational provision. State planning committees were in place under the old legislation, which you are seeking to overturn today. These included representatives from non&hyphen;government and government school authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They provided advice to the Commonwealth on whether proposals for new schools satisfied the criteria relating to planned educational provision. You are losing that opportunity. This bill takes that opportunity away and reduces the capacity of the Commonwealth to effectively administer the expenditure of some $2 billion a year. Despite the requirements of the new schools policy, and contrary to your claims that there was an undue restriction on applications, the majority of applications for new schools were able to demonstrate consistency with the principles of planned educational provision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the operations of the new schools policy, discussions with other school authorities ensured that there was a much more <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6358"> effective use of Commonwealth resources and a much more effective use of resources within the private sector. I think to suggest otherwise would be clearly wrong. Non-government enrolments grew by 126,000 in 1985 to over 900,000 nationally in 1995. The ratio of students in the non&hyphen;government sector increased from 26 per cent in 1985 to 29 per cent in 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since 1985, 95 per cent of applications from the Catholic education authorities satisfied the criteria. The Catholic education system in particular enjoyed considerable benefit from this new schools policy. That was especially the case in New South Wales. I am advised that the schematic Catholic schools, in particular, were able to quite effectively identify a predictable share of school population. They were able to manage very well to ensure that the Catholic education system in this country could meet the challenges of rationalisation and changes that occurred with the result of demographic and economic imperatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was quite effective in ensuring that enrolments in the Catholic education system were able to meet the challenges of difficult times. Two&hyphen;thirds of all non-government enrolments have grown from Catholic schools, but the highest rate of growth that you are proposing is from other groups in our society. You are seeking to cater for a range of so-called  Christian schools outside the Catholic education system. It is not just Christian schools but also a whole range of religious groups that you are seeking to cater to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The average rate of enrolments in independent schools has been about three per cent per annum since 1985. The average increase across Australia has been about 9,000 nationally each year. As a result, the independent school sector has increased its share of total enrolments from 5.4 per cent in 1985 to 7.9 per cent. The new schools policy under the Labor government&mdash;and I make this very clear so it is at least on the public record&mdash;reflected a number of inter&hyphen;related concerns which I do not believe this government has sought to seriously address.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new schools policy sought to plan new non&hyphen;government schools in a way consistent <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> with the need to cater for the growth and the shift in overall school populations. You have no provision for that. The new schools policy sought to avoid the tensions which became apparent from uncoordinated growth in non&hyphen;government schools places in areas already well provided. You have no provision within your legislation to cater for that. The new schools policy sought to cater for the needs relating to the various forms of educational disadvantage, and this bill does not cater for that. The broadbanding proposals in this bill do not effectively cater for that in the public sector, and they are fundamentally flawed in regard to the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new schools policy sought to provide for orderly development of non-government schools without seriously reducing the standards of service in existing schools either government or non-government, and this bill has no response to that. The new schools policy sought to promote the economic use of public resources, and this bill provides for open slather. You have no response to that provision of promoting the economic use of very scarce public resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments that the Labor Party have moved with regard to the schedule are 2 to 10, 12, 14 and 20. We are taking them together. We understand that, according to the nature of these things, we will vote on them together. What we are seeking to do is to focus attention on the planned educational provision which this bill currently abdicates. The non-government sector over the last 10 years has been funded by the Commonwealth in accordance with a range of criteria that I have just outlined. This bill does not have any response to those fundamental criticisms of the unrestrained, unplanned growth of the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Non-government schools, as outlined in the National Catholic Education Commission to the Senate committee inquiry, indicated that there was likely to be a continued growth as a result of the changes that were made under the new schools policy, and that was growth that was likely to continue. What the National Catholic Education Commission supported was proper planning provisions&mdash;planning provisions which Labor was seeking to put <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6359"> back into this legislation&mdash;and a very basic and minimum requirement of the process of consultation with other educational authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Proponents of the new schools gained access to demographic and planning data at a state and territory level. You have no provision in this bill for that to occur. Consultation meetings between educational authorities were important to ensure that all players within education had an opportunity to understand where the industry was going and to provide for effective coordination, as I say, of scarce government resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think it is unreasonable that if we are handing out over $2 billion of Commonwealth funding a year there should be a nationally consistent approach to planned educational provision. It is irresponsible to dispense millions of taxpayers' dollars based on a registration system which, as we have already indicated in this debate, is fundamentally flawed, is not geared to planning provisions across this country and which has no recognition of the importance of the impact of decisions being made by one group of people in the education community on others within the education community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">McKinnon highlighted the exercise of freedom of choice in his report. He said that choice is not an unambiguous good. He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Increased choice for some may result in decreased choice for others. Choice in all schools may be limited in an area where enrolments are limited and, the more thinly spread, the more limited the curriculum. Similarly, in an area well served with schools but where there is a limited choice of the type of school, latecomers may effectively be prevented from offering wider choice.</PARA>
<PARA>The resolution of the very practical problem of how do you distribute very scarce educational resources is not adequately responded to by saying, `We'll just leave it to the market.' These are much more important issues than can be determined by a market distribution or mechanism. The future of our children demands more of this parliament than to say, `We'll just leave it to the market,' and that is essentially what this government is doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are seeking in our amendments is to require non-government schools to seek to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> establish or significantly change their operation, to put their proposals before state based committees and to provide information to other players within the educational community. What we are seeking to do is to place back into this legislation the provisions of the new schools policy as well as to effect changes to that policy to reflect the legitimate criticisms that have been made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not standing here flat-footed and saying that all that went on before should continue. We are saying there needs to be a constant process of review and updating. That is what the McKinnon report was all about. Our amendments seek to clarify those issues and seek to improve the provision of planned educational services across this country in a manner which will genuinely meet the needs of Australians into the future. This bill quite clearly fails in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are seeking to do, as I have indicated, is to ensure the protection of the choice of all Australians and to make sure that choices are not exercised by the few at the expense of the many. What this government has failed to do is to live up to its obligations and to understand its responsibilities in terms of the provision of those issues.</PARA>

I would say, however, that I think Senator Carr has made some important points about the problems of the emergence of many more smaller schools and to say that that is quite contrary to the notions of efficiency that this government has espoused so far. I also want to speak in relation to the issue of choice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I speak on behalf of children in this respect. If we are to see more of our children in much smaller schools, we will see them having a less of a choice in terms of the range of subjects, less choice in terms of the sorts of facilities that they can use in schools and less choice socially as well. The more you concentrate our children into small schools, the more you remove those choices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before we wrap up this debate, I want to mention one aspect of planning which has not been dealt with so far in the debate, and that is the provision for children with disabilities. It is a planning issue. It is one that the government ought to have paid more attention to in this legislation. In fact, the government shows in schedule 8 that funds for special education have remained the same over the 1997-2000 quadrennium in government and non-government schools. It is interesting, given that we are going to see a shift into private schools, that there has not been a consequential shift of funding for disability services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The National Catholic Education Commission pointed this out. They said that they were disappointed that the government did not make the provision that it had promised in the election context for additional support for disabled children. They also said that the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> special education area is not adequately catered for in this bill and was not adequately catered for under the previous arrangements either.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that the government did promise an additional $6 million for disabled students before the election. This has not turned up, neither has there been recognition that there will be some disabled children who will also wish, presumably,&mdash;amongst the 23,000 who will exit state schools&mdash;to do likewise, that is, go into private schools. If the government is serious about choice, it ought to provide that choice for parents of disabled children too. In fact, the department was going to come back to me with some figures on the levels of students with disabilities in private schools, but I have not seen that so far.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an important question and one which the government ought to address. As I say, it is a planning matter and one which I would like to see the Commonwealth government continue, or at least resume, an interest in. I will finish now by supporting Senator Carr's and Senator O'Brien's remarks about schools and about the need to plan for them. It is a great disappointment to the Democrats that the government is stepping back from that responsibility.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To respond to Senator O'Brien and others who seem to have the view that the states have no interest at all in the setting up of schools, I draw their attention to page 801 of the discussion paper on the review of the new schools policy. The table on that page highlights state and territory non&hyphen;government school registration requirements. Senator O'Brien, I think you are stretching a longbow to say that it is completely unregulated in Queensland. You focus on the fact that there is no minimum enrolment requirement there, but you do not bother to mention to everybody else who might be listening that there are requirements vis&hyphen;a&hyphen;vis curriculum, vis&hyphen;a&hyphen;vis school organisation, vis&hyphen;a&hyphen;vis the physical environment, vis&hyphen;a&hyphen;vis teacher qualifications, and with respect to financial viability.

<PARA>This amendment specifies the criteria for use by planning committees for the assessment of new schools proposals, which were drawn extensively from the recommendation in the McKinnon review. It goes specifically to the issues of catchment areas and other measures designed to ensure that other schools and other people's choices are not undermined by the exercising of choice by some. Of course, it ensures that there are at least minimum requirements relating to the establishment of new schools and that there is not an undermining of the educational provision currently existing within any particular locality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These issues have been extensively canvassed. As I understand it, there were amendments to the Labor Party's amendments which were to be moved by Senator Allison. This amendment 11 seeks to establish minimum enrolment criteria for non-government schools and to ensure that there is an effective distribution and an effective use of scarce public resources in terms of the subsidies provided to private education.</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ongoing monitoring of the implementation of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Act 1996</EMPHASIS>  over the 4&hyphen;year period of its operation, with particular reference to the impact of the abolition of the New Schools Policy and the Enrolment Benchmark Adjustment on government schools".</PARA>
<PARA>This amendment moved by the Australian Democrats is in recognition of the fact that neither the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) nor the department has been able to provide this chamber with a clear picture of the impact of these changes. Even the government majority on the Senate Employment, Education and Training Legislation <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Committee acknowledged that they were not in a position to assess the conflicting claims between the states and the department. I said in my speech during the second reading debate, and I will say it again: no&hyphen;one knows what the outcome of these changes will be. Nobody has the data on which to base any meaningful assessment of the impact of these changes on public schools. Not one single person in the entire country could stand up here and say that they know where this will end.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the risk the majority of this chamber have taken in passing this legislation. They have taken that risk, and the Democrats believe the very least this chamber should do is put in place an open and accountable monitoring process to enable a parliamentary review of the operation of the legislation every 12 months. Where else will people go if they have concerns about the impact of this bill? The short answer is: there is nowhere else to go. There are no planning committees, no review procedures and no other means of looking at what is happening as this legislation starts to bite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This sort of monitoring role for a Senate committee is not new. This chamber has previously accepted this role when there has been concern about the implications of pieces of legislation. Perhaps the most notable in recent years was the reference to the Senate community affairs committee to monitor the operation of the previous government's private health insurance reforms because of concerns expressed by the medical profession at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we can take doctors' concerns seriously enough to set up a Senate monitoring process, surely we can take just as seriously the concerns of parents, teachers and state governments. If the senators who voted for this legislation are so confident that it will not damage the public school system, or even the non&hyphen;government system for that matter, they should not be afraid to support the Democrats' amendment and to subject this legislation to ongoing scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to make some final remarks in proposing this amendment. Firstly, we need to realise that the real effect of the enrolment <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6365"> benchmark adjustment will not be felt until 1998. Secondly, the bulk of the cut, which will be to state schools, will not be felt until the year 2000. So I recommend to senators that this bill be referred to the Employment, Education and Training References Committee for inquiry and report on the last sitting day of each of 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will briefly indicate why we do not believe this amendment is at all necessary. Senator Allison knows full well that numerous accountability mechanisms are available through this chamber. If at any time this chamber wants to make a formal reference to that committee that it looks at this legislation in one year or the next, well and good. It can do that. Senators can individually, without the support of the rest of the Senate, seek, through the estimates process, all the appropriate information.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this amendment were passed, we would need another resolution of this chamber in a year's time if, for example, we had figured out this legislation is all okay. The mechanisms are already there for individual senators&mdash;through estimates committees, through questions on notice, et cetera&mdash;and it is open to this chamber on an annual basis to make that reference to the committee. That may well be appropriate on an annual basis, but the senator is asking us to commit now to a formal reference to a committee for three or four years ahead. We think that is inappropriate. This chamber will choose each year, as is appropriate, what it wants to do.</PARA>

<STATE> (South Australia)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(12.39 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Shipping Grants Legislation Bill 1996 is a clear indication that this new government does not have an industry <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> policy of any consequence. The way this bill has been handled and the way the measures in this bill have been put forward clearly demonstrate this government's complete lack of industry policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last two to three months, there has been an ever growing chorus from Australian business people, from manufacturers in particular, including the shipbuilding and shipping industries, about the need for a decent industry policy in this country. The call to have a vision about where manufacturing should go, and in particular where our shipping industry should go, has been made many times.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Though this bill does not deal with the issue of the ships bounty, it is in many ways related to the lack of philosophy this new government has towards our shipping industry in Australia. We have strenuously opposed the abolition of the ships bounty for our shipbuilding industry, a shipbuilding industry that now, in the fast ferry and fast ship area, is a world leader&mdash;employing thousands of people and each year selling to the world ships to the value of several hundred millions of dollars. It is an industry that is growing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With this new government we are seeing that bounty come to an end. We will be one of the few countries in the OECD, if not the only one, that will provide no assistance to the shipbuilding industry. Yet we will be selling our ships into markets that are corrupted by the provision of tariffs, subsidies and non-tariff measures to encourage the development of shipbuilding industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we were in government, we made it clear that we were not opposed to removing subsidies, bounties and non-tariff measures but only on the basis that every other country that was building ships did the same. We made it clear that, in particular, we would look towards the United States of America to repeal the so-called Jones act, which prohibits ships manufactured in Australia being sold into the American market. It prohibits our fast ferries, which are the world's best, most efficient and most technological advanced, being sold into that market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6367"> We have strenuously opposed the government's decision to abolish the bounty legisla tion for this industry. Anybody who has any knowledge of this area is extremely proud of the industry which has been built, designed and created by Australians. But it is now being severely affected by this new government's decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Shipping Grants Legislation Bill is another example of a move away from any idea that we should have an involvement as a government in encouraging an indigenous shipping industry in Australia. The overall philosophy of the existing provisions goes right back to the 1980s. I have been advised that they were developed even by a previous coalition government. Mr Hunt, when he was the minister for transport, started the process that led to the introduction of the Ships (Capital Grants) Act in 1987. The purpose of that legislation was to encourage Australian owned shipping companies to purchase up-to-date ships to operate as registered Australian ships both in the domestic market and in the international market. But this government wants to repeal all of this. It is not encouraging an Australian owned shipping industry. I think in this we see the heavy hand in particular of the new Treasurer, Mr Costello.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There would be some advisers in the Treasury, I am sure, who would see legislation such as the Ships (Capital Grants) Act as an unnecessary interference in the free market. The people who say that have no conception of what is in the national interest in Australia. They believe that if you leave it to the free market other things will occur&mdash;sometimes by osmosis or by some sort of transcendental activity&mdash;so that somehow, out of nothing, an Australian shipping industry will develop.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not take that view in opposition. We never took that view in government. We believe this legislation is wrongly conceived and is against the national interest. We believe, in general, that these measures will seriously undermine the viability of the Australian industry. The loss of a viable, national industry can and should be opposed for a number of reasons, including the decimation of the industry, which will have a negative effect on the net services component of the current account.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Bureau of Transport Economics estimated for 1986-87 that, if there had been no merchant fleet, the current account deficit would have been increased by $440 million&mdash;about 14 per cent of the services deficit and about four per cent of the current account deficit. Of course, we have had the Treasurer lecturing Australians over the recent months that the No. 1 issue he wants to deal with is the current account deficit. He wants to turn it around, but you have introduced legislation that will exacerbate the current account deficit in the services area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decimation of the national merchant fleet would affect our defence capacity. Several ship owners have entered into a memorandum of understanding with the navy to provide assistance in case of a national emergency. Some might even have facilities on their ships to specifically assist the navy. The lack of trained seafarers may also make emergency crewing of the navy more difficult in a national emergency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sea transport, of course, is environmentally more desirable than some modes of land transport. In terms of energy consumption, bulk shipping uses only 0.2 megajoules per tonne/kilometre as compared to 0.4 for government rail and 1.4 for articulated trucks. In terms of greenhouse gas emissions, bulk sea transport generates 13 grams of CO2 per tonne/kilometre, as compared to 29 grams for government rail and an even higher rate of grams for the trucking business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government in recent times has shown no interest in the greenhouse gas emissions issue. It even had the embarrassment of being properly lectured by the American President, when he was here last week, about the need for international rules for greenhouse gas emissions that are legislatively binding on countries. Our new government has steered right clear of that and, as a result, was severely embarrassed by the President's remarks in his successful visit to Australia last week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australian crews are highly trained. Use of poorer quality crew and older, less well&hyphen;maintained vessels will significantly increase insurance costs paid by users, particularly given that Australian vessels undertake longer voyages in often severe conditions. Needless <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6368"> to say, the risk of environmental damage will also be increased.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Great Barrier Reef, along the north eastern coast of Australia, is one of the great world heritage natural assets&mdash;not just for Australia but for the world. It is always at risk from a major marine disaster such as an oil tanker going down. We have seen this happen in the last 30 years, right back to the 1960s. We saw the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Torrey Canyon </EMPHASIS>disaster off the south coast of England and the environmental damage it did. So we are under no illusions that Australia is always at risk, in environmental terms, of a marine disaster.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decimation of the industry is likely to have a number of detrimental effects in other areas: marine insurance, stevedoring, towage, pilotage, development and supply of shipping technology, and ship management repair and maintenance. Australia will also lose vital information on the state of international shipping markets. Port and other maritime regulatory authorities will have a greatly reduced pool of skilled labour to draw on. This may affect not only the provision of harbour masters and ship control officers but also safety, investigation and emergency personnel in state departments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most countries, be they OECD countries or otherwise, provide fiscal assistance to their national fleets. I think that is the point that I made in my remarks on the bounty. Most OECD countries provide fiscal assistance to the national fleets. They understand the national interest at stake in having their own national fleet. They also understand the importance of not being in a closed market but being in the marketplace, competing to build up the skill levels of staff and management as well as seafarers and so on. All of this is seen in most countries in the OECD as a national interest issue. Unfortunately, this new coalition government does not have the same view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fiscal assistance to these national fleets in other countries includes depreciation allowances, concessional tax rates, and concessional loans and subsidies. As such, the abolition of assistance proposed would not create a level playing field for Australian shipping in the global market but rather place <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the industry in a less competitive position. This government, with this legislation, wants our shipping fleet to be less competitive because most other OECD countries, our competitors, do provide assistance that I have just outlined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australian ship owners and workers have made significant gains in terms of productivity and competitiveness in the last decade. Since 1989, over $2 billion has been committed to investment in ships, with the result that the Australian fleet is half the age of the world fleet. Manning levels on Australian international ships have fallen from an average of 31.6 in 1986 to 18.4 in 1995, which the minister, in his second reading speech, conceded are now consistent with international standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Industrial disputes hit their lowest level in a decade in 1992-1993, when only 23 ship days were lost due to crew disputes. It is not right to now attack this industry that has made such progress halfway through a restructuring process merely to satisfy the government's hatred of the Maritime Union of Australia. Clearly, the underlying reason these two bills have been brought in is the opposition's ideological obsession against the maritime workers of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet over the decade that union has agreed, in discussion with government and with the owners, to reduce the manning levels from 31.6 to 18.4&mdash;nearly half the number. There are certainly ongoing discussions. The union recognises that levels could go even lower. It wants to do it in a planned way. But this government, for ideological reasons to prove a point&mdash;and this is almost a theology on its part&mdash;has consistently attacked Australian seafarers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You will remember that, when they were previously in government, the coalition did nothing to deal with the issue of updating the fleet and getting higher productivity. They just carried out a no&hyphen;action program, other than to make, from time to time, remarks attacking the workers in the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The early withdrawal of the capital grant will have a number of specific effects. Shipowners will now have less incentive to invest in new ships and technology. As a result, the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6369"> fleet will age, which will increase costs which must ultimately be passed on to users. Further increases in capital productivity, and hence manning levels, will be less likely as the cost of new vessels increases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Repealing the grant paid to international trading vessels will have a number of effects. It will provide an incentive for Australian vessels to switch from international to coastal operations, so placing pressure on the `invisibles' deficit, the current account deficit. This will occur as a result of increasing the cost of international traders relative to coastal ones.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> There are the examples of companies which, as a result of the introduction of this bill, have reorganised their fleet schedules to increase export earnings. Is that what we should be about? Of course it is. This is a result of the legislation which we previously introduced; we are improving our export earnings. However, for ideological reasons, the government is taking action mainly to have a go at the marine workers, the seafarers. In having a go at them, it is actually shooting itself in the foot and weakening our ability to reduce the current account deficit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Australian ship owners will be placed at a competitive disadvantage in relation to ships registered in other countries where there are generous tax concessions and also specifically in relation to ships registered in tax havens. So there we have it. Instead of having an industry with its confidence growing, one that can be competitive with this modest assistance from the Australian government, we will be putting ourselves at a distinct disadvantage to most of our OECD competitors. We will be tilting the playing field against ourselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> This government displays a classical, own&hyphen;goal attitude. It wants to kick a goal against our shipping industry when everybody would say it is in our national interest to have the capacity for an up&hyphen;to&hyphen;date maritime merchant fleet operating around the world. To the opposition, it is very strange indeed that one of the first bills this government is trying to put through hits on the head the development of a modern maritime fleet in Australia. As a result, we oppose this legislation. I will indicate in this second reading debate that we <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will support the government amendment which, as we understand it, will now have the effect of allowing the three vessels under construction, that would not previously have received the grant, to receive it. When this bill was proposed, that was the most preposterous suggestion of all: that three vessels&mdash;already under construction&mdash;would not be eligible for the grant. The government has seen the light of day and so we will support its amendment in that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> We will not support the Democrats' amendment to establish a working party because, on the advice we have received, there has not been consultation with the various parties in the industry about how that working party would operate. We think you should support such a working party only where there has been proper consultation, and the players in the industry have agreed to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> We support the Greens' amendment, a second reading one, calling on the government to pursue multilateral agreements to protect the industrial conditions of international seafarers and to enforce safety standards. It would also put in place a comprehensive international compensation regime for damage to the marine environment, with a requirement to report to the Senate once a year on progress. We support that Greens' amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In supporting the amendments, we want to say that we do not support this bill. We believe it is an indication that this government does not have a clear and comprehensive industry policy. Industry and business leaders are already complaining publicly and loudly about this government's lack of vision in regard to our manufacturing and transport industries. In this case, our international shipping industry is going to go backwards because of an ideological position&mdash;or an ideological aversion&mdash;this government has towards the seafarers of this country, particularly the workers who have made major sacrifices to improving this industry over the last decade in a very cooperative way.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Shipping Grants Legislation Bill 1996 seeks to commence the dismantling of the cooperative approach to maritime reform, which has seen disputation fall significantly and productivity rise significantly in the Australian maritime industry over the past decade. It seeks to target two measures, both of which were to the benefit of the industry, introduced by the previous government. The first is the seven per cent capital investment allowance for new ships, which was first introduced in 1987 and has since been extended twice. The second is the rebate for employers of seafarers in respect of PAYE tax remittances for their employees. This measure was part of the last set of maritime reform legislation introduced in 1994 and mirrors international practice by many other developed countries. The government estimates that the repeal of the capital grants will save $12 million while the repeal of the tax rebate will save $40 million over four years, or $10 million per year. Incidentally, there is a conflict between the government's budget papers and the EM on that matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill was tabled in May and sent to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee for report. The committee <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> heard evidence from three major companies&mdash;BHP, Shell and Mackay Sugar Cooperative&mdash;who were midway through major shipbuilding exercises and were caught up by the premature termination of the capital grants. After public exposure and intense lobbying, the government has apparently revised its position. I understand that it will be moving amendments to allow those three ships to retain access to grants provided that they are delivered before 1 July next year. I do not have those amendments before me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats will be supporting those proposed government amendments on capital grants. If those amendments do not materialise, we will oppose the early cessation of the capital grants scheme. We believe that the capital grants scheme has played a significant role in updating and modernising the Australian shipping fleet. More modern vessels have encouraged the reduction of shipping crew ratios, which have fallen from 36 to 18 per vessel over the last decade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now have internationally competitive crewing ratios, and that is a credit to the unions, shipowners and seafarers. Australian crewing levels are now lower than the world average crew size of 23.8 and the OECD average of 22. Obviously, more may need to be done. I note that the MUA has been resisting attempts by some shipowners to take crewing ratios lower, even when it is safe to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is appropriate that we look at whether industrial assistance programs are still needed. As you know from my minority report tabled yesterday, the Australian Democrats will oppose the early abolition of the shipbuilders bounty. With regard to this issue, between 1988 and 1994, 36 additional and replacement vessels were added into the Australian fleet, representing a turnover of 45 per cent of the fleet and reducing the age of the Australian fleet to well below the world average.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, the ships capital grants scheme is one program that has achieved its purpose. It has done a good job for the Australian fleet. It can now be terminated, in our view. With the amendment that the government has <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6371"> agreed to which protects those in transition through the scheme, we will support its abolition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The repeal of the International Shipping (Australian&hyphen;resident Seafarers) Grants Act 1995 and, with it, the rebate of PAYE taxes paid by Australian resident seafarers on ships that operate 50 per cent or more of their time in international trade is another matter. The 1995 act was an important and essential policy change, which we supported at the time. We thought it was appropriate then, and we think it is appropriate now. The government claims that that rebate was some sort of handout from a captive Labor government to the MUA to keep them quiet over the ANL sale. That is what is implied in the second reading speech. That is not how we saw it then, and it is not how we see it now. It is our view that the PAYE measure is a revenue exercise and has nothing to do with that spurious argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This measure was one of several recommended by the Shipping Industry Reform Authority in August 1994. The report noted that 12 out of the 25 OECD countries make concessions for the tax treatment of national seafarers on international routes. Many shipowners from other countries are able to avoid the payment of tax altogether by permitting the offshore movement of vessels and crew employment. The report concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the significance of this cost, it is considered essential that Australian seafarers in the international trades be treated similarly.</PARA>
<PARA>In short, without this measure, Australian ships will not be competitive against the ships of other OECD countries let alone flags of convenience ships. This point was clearly made in submissions from the Australian Shipowners Association to the Senate committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, that does not mean that Australia obtains no tax revenue from Australian ships and seafarers. As Australian residents, seafarers are obviously spending in this country, as the shipowners are running their administration and are paying company tax and all the other taxes in this country. If the shipping industry were to disappear completely because it was uncompetitive, Treasury would lose <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this much larger pool of revenue. I draw to your attention that, once again, this government has failed to do a cost&hyphen;benefit analysis and any kind of modelling analysis or sensitivity analysis over getting rid of this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is obviously the assessment made by the other 12 OECD countries that now provide full or partial rebates on seafarers' PAYE taxes. Once again, the principle is obvious. Australia must not act in isolation of its competitors. Short-term deficit reduction measures have to be weighed against greater medium&hyphen; and long-term harm to a vital industry. I say to you again that you have not done a cost&hyphen;benefit analysis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note in passing that the authority also pointed to the importance of vigilant port control inspections of ships from flags of convenience states to ensure that competition is on a fair basis on routes to and from Australia. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority has considerably increased its inspection activity since 1991. It is now inspecting over 2,700 ships per year, with 10 per cent being referred for irregularities and further safety repairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1994 maritime reform package, which included the PAYE initiative, also required the shipowners and the maritime unions to negotiate savings that would deliver efficiency improvements roughly equivalent in value to the PAYE measure, which was about $19 million per annum. The result, the maritime industry restructuring agreement, has seen a quantum shift from industry awards to enterprise agreements, the cessation of industry training of ratings&mdash;a measure itself worth $190 million a year&mdash;increased flexibility and cooperation in the engagement system, and a new system of dealing with ratings who were the subject of disciplinary action. Contrary to the ideological ravings&mdash;and they are ravings sometimes&mdash;of some of those in the government and elsewhere, these have been significant achievements, a point recognised by both unions and employers. But, clearly, more needs to be done. International trade does not stand still and nor should maritime reform and change in the maritime industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The way forward in our view is to encourage workers, their unions and their employers <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6372"> to continue working constructively together. Under the previous government, a new era of reconciliation was initiated, and that should continue. The pace of reform might not be as fast as the ideologues in government would like, but it is achieving results. Confrontation will not get us there; consultation and negotiation will.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that access to the PAYE rebate should continue to be tied to continuing reform. The employers and the unions both claim good progress to date. Both sectors, particularly the employers, want to see more progress. The government disagrees that there is good progress. I accept the opinion of those more directly affected, namely the unions and the employers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1994 SIRA report had a wide range of other measures which it recommended to both unions and employers. Progress in some of these has been far too slow. In the committee stage, I will be proposing an amendment to continue this process by the establishment, under the International Shipping (Australian&hyphen;resident Seafarers) Grants Act, of a process to continue the reform work. I have circulated that amendment before you, and you should note that I have withdrawn the previous amendment. That working party will be required to report back to parliament on its progress. If progress is not satisfactory, then we as the Australian Democrats will review our position on the PAYE rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats are satisfied that the parties are abiding by the commitment that they gave in 1994 when the rebate was introduced. While progress is being made on maritime reform, parliament should be prepared to underwrite that progress by ensuring that our tax system is internationally competitive in seafaring routes. This PAYE grant is about competitiveness, and that is where the focus should be.</PARA></SPEECH>

<STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(2.10 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The explanatory memorandum of this bill is a sad testimony of the government's approach. It includes a financial impact statement showing how much the government will save but gives no consideration at all to the impact on people, either <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australian seafarers or non&hyphen;Australian seafarers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation with seafarers is one of the worst and most shameful examples of the action of international competition and the race for the bottom. Seafarers have virtually no protection since they operate in international waters. While there are many national awards specifying wages and conditions, there are few requirements for any ship, regardless of the country of registration, to provide minimum wages or conditions to all seafarers, regardless of nationality. Under such a situation, the economic imperative to reduce costs and increase profit margins will virtually force shipping companies to employ the cheapest possible crews.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If any nation has award standards for its seafarers on international ships, either national flag or foreign flag vessels, then the response of shipping companies is almost certain: to hire crews from nations without such conditions. There are extreme impacts of hiring crews from nations which do not offer even nominal protection for such workers&mdash;workers who operate in international waters&mdash;when no nation takes an interest in their treatment and when their foreign status as employees of a foreign vessel and/or the status of their agreement on wages and conditions is seen as a commercial matter outside the ambit of national law or concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The major impacts are that such workers have effectively no rights at all and no legal framework whatever to protect their interests. They are entirely at the mercy of shipowners. Virtually no nation will let such a crew disembark on any but the most temporary basis. No claim for asylum or relief of mistreatment is generally recognised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The result at this point, which is fairly well documented, is that horrific abuses are perpetrated against vulnerable seafarers. There are many examples of crews not being paid. They may be mistreated, denied food or denied adequate food. They may be beaten, raped or otherwise physically abused. They are, sometimes, killed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At sea, the only power is the captain of the vessel. The captain and his officers, who are the perpetrators of the abuses, are the only <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6373"> keepers of official records. All power and all appeal is in the hands of the perpetrators of abuse. At the very least, an outcome is understaffing, with the consequent loss of safety for not only the ship but also other ships and the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the few things that prevent Australian flag ships from the pressure to behave in the same manner or absorb the competitive penalties from behaving more responsibly is the act which this bill seeks to repeal&mdash;the International Shipping (Australian&hyphen;resident Seafarers) Grants Act. These grants for seafarers recognise that providing crew conditions and staffing levels adequate for safety and ship maintenance, and the pressure of paying seafarers their wages, costs money. Until there are international standards for seafarers, and they are enforced generally on a multinational basis&mdash;the ILO standards exist but are rarely enforced&mdash;national action is the only alternative. National action needs to go beyond imposing costs on Australian industry and provide some measure to reduce the competitive penalty of acting responsibly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In our deregulated world, the only means to do this is by some measure of support for those who do act responsibly and in accordance with Australian standards. An alternative that should be looked at is to put a fee or charge on all incoming ships for inspection as to conditions and treatment of crew, payment of wages and whether the staff levels are, in fact, sufficient to run the ship safely. This would be parallel to physical inspection of ships for safety.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is unconscionable to simply ignore what are effectively human rights abuses or an inability for ships which enter our ports to operate safely. If conditions were adequate by Australian standards, a large portion of the fee could be refunded. Where they were not, action might be taken, but at least the major part of the fee would be retained to offset an ongoing support for Australian crew.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The safety issue, aside from the physical maintenance of ships, is significant. Commercial ships on automatic pilots can easily run over small ships, aside from their inability to actually see physical signs of danger, or water breaking on rocks or reefs. Where crew levels <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are so low that there are only one or two people on watch at night, and where those people may occasionally go for a break or coffee while the ship sails under automatic pilot, or even where the ship sails under automatic pilot with an officer on deck, or where there are only one or two people on the deck, depth sounders, radar and other equipment may not be monitoring regularly and, in any case, may not give warning of something, even a large yacht with a wooden or non&hyphen;aluminium mast and spars, or a rock, or a suddenly arising reef. These, of course, can be seen or heard from the deck if there are a few crew members on deck watch.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has seen ships run aground in the last few years. Environmental problems are not confined to tankers. Other ships may leak fuel and have cargoes that represent environmental hazards. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sanko Harvest</EMPHASIS>, which ran aground in February 1991 off Esperance on the south coast of Western Australia, was carrying fertiliser, which, in such concentrations, can have a devastating effect on reefs and marine coastal ecologies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Shipping grants is one of the other issues here. They are for new or extensively modified ships to assist with equipment, allowing a safe reduction of crew. Much of this is automated equipment, allowing a worker to safely work alone, or nearly alone. In the existing legislation, the shipping grants were intended to be phased out in 1997. This cuts it out a year earlier, but consequences for industry of having the time lines changed are economically significant. Plans and contracts for construction of major ships is a lengthy process. Changing funding frameworks with little warning creates problems. The minority report of the legislative committee highlights this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government amendments also recognise this, but do not address the real problem, which is that plans and arrangements were made several years ago on the basis that the grants would run throughout the 1996&hyphen;97 financial year, rather than stopping approximately six months ago. This depends on the quality of the equipment, but also provides little safety margin for equipment failure, if <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6374"> crews are reduced on the assumption that technology makes it safe to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where automation is in the form of alarms on depth sounders or radar, the assumption is not only that the machine is on and working, but that it is capable of picking up images. Wooden ships with non&hyphen;aluminium spars are notoriously bad radar targets. A crew member on watch may alert the helm and narrowly avert an accident. An alarm that does not see the ship will not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been given instructions by one of my staffers, Dhanu, that in his personal experience freighters and tankers frequently go on autopilot and do not detect something that could be a 95&hyphen;foot, three&hyphen;masted, aluminium sparred ship of substantial size&mdash;he was talking about something of 120 tonnes. During three years sailing, he said he just avoided collision at least five times, under clear weather conditions and in spite of hailing by voice, bells, signal lights and radio on emergency frequencies. In one instance, they narrowly averted collision with a large tanker which passed by at speed within 10 feet of them. This was in the Straits of Malacca, a heavily travelled, narrow, busy seaway where it would be expected that extra attention should be given due to the large number of risks and frequency of accidents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last 10 years, at least 30 ships have had accidents on the Great Barrier Reef which were subject to investigations. Of those, approximately two&hyphen;thirds were groundings. In many cases, lack of adequate attention is implicit. The other third were collisions where lack of attention&mdash;direct, watchful, human attention&mdash;was nearly always a factor. About one&hyphen;quarter of these ships were Australian flag vessels. Thirty&hyphen;three had pilots on board, indicating either lack of care or a possible crew related inability to respond to a developing situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last 10 years, there have been a total of 97 accidents in Australian waters which were subject to investigations. Of those, 37, or roughly one&hyphen;third, were groundings; 21, or about one&hyphen;quarter, were collisions; 11, all in the last five years, were fatalities or injuries; 13 were where a ship foundered; 10 were fires; four, including the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS>, were major <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> structural failures; one was a berthing incident; and there were 32 incidents involving Australian ships with Australian crews.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government amendments recognise the basic truth that, where an agreement has already been made to construct a ship, it is simply unfair to alter the economic conditions under which such an agreement was made. Any agreement covered by the government amendments would have been made in the expectation that the shipping grants would continue until the end of June 1997. The Senate has virtually always voted to remedy a situation where executive government seeks to impose costs on industries, where there has been an extensive forward commercial arrangement, through legislative change of the conditions under which such arrangements were made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have looked at the Democrats second reading amendments, but they may be a way of allowing the indefensible. Without the Democrats' support, this bill may have died, although, of course, I am in no way speaking for the other Independent senators. I am not sure what will be achieved by the seeking of a statutory working party, because these committees almost universally push for economic deregulation and the nature of the committees is, of course, very important. The terms of reference of the working party do still reflect a rationalist approach and are intended to pursue the competitive agenda. This would work against the situation of seafarers and is likely to work against both human and environmental safety. The terms of reference may allow the bill to get support.</PARA>

<PARA>It is impossible to regulate without agreed international standards. Regulation must be for both workers'&mdash;human rights&mdash;and environmental protection. Nations must have the moral and internationally recognised legal duty and right to enforce these international standards equally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The need for a comprehensive environmental liability regime was agreed to by the Senate in relation to a motion I put in 1993. We reiterate that need. If I had my druthers, I would see that Australia does what the United States does and imposes its own liability regime. That is simply being able to clearly work out who is responsible and knowing that there is a means of meeting financial and other costs should such a disaster occur.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not the case in Australia at the moment. There are limited regimes for bonds in the shipping industry. But there is no comprehensive liability regime, and the reason for that is often cited as the need to be internationally competitive. I often think that if any industry benefits from utilising flag of convenience or lower standards of shipping, perhaps the outcome should be that those particular industries or companies end up bearing part of the cost if their choice to reduce the standard of shipping results in a dreadful maritime disaster. A liability regime is a much more sensible way to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We reiterate that need and add the need for comprehensive liability relating to the cost of ensuring that the basic human rights of seafarers are protected. This must include legal costs and the cost of the repatriation of seafarers fleeing the conditions on their ships. Australian governments are already having to deal with such cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate, in passing such amendment, has the right to ask for a report of progress. This was done in 1993 with support from the then government. As yet, I am still unclear as to what the details of that report were.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I concur with the submission just made by Senator Margetts of the Greens (WA) and will be supporting the amendment that she has put forward relating to the Shipping Grants Legislation Bill. I also concur with the Australian Labor Party's comments on this earlier in the day. As a Tasmanian, I have a particular interest in the bounty because it affects Incat, which is a large modern industrial operation by Tasmanian standards, if not by world standards. It employs over 1,000 people and has a very vigorous training program for skilling people into the work force at a time when this government is removing many training programs which would otherwise skill people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have the worst unemployment situation, the lowest per capita income and arguably the worst financial situation of any of the states. So, whilst it might seem unusual for me as a Green to be standing here in defence of a major industry in Tasmania&mdash;we get pilloried for not doing so&mdash;the reality is that this <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6376"> industry is Tasmanian home&hyphen;grown. It is not like the big old industries dependent on secret subsidised hydro-electric contracts, on subsidised demolition of forests or on the digging up of mines&mdash;all of which seem to have their headquarters on the mainland and disburse their profits immediately out of the state. It does have a much richer flow-on benefit to Tasmania's economy and its social wellbeing in general.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has been talked about here is the government penny&hyphen;pinching to the point of reneging by one year on a bounty scheme which is very important to Bob Clifford's operation and to the welfare of this industry. Tasmania has, along with Western Australia, taken a world lead in the production of high&hyphen;speed catamaran shipping, which is a very vigorous industry in this day of much altered shipping profile around the world. We know that the allegiance of shipbuilders has its limitations, that they are looking at places like China to expand in the future or to transfer operations if the going gets too tough in Australia. We know that when it comes to the payment of labour and so on we simply cannot compete with places like China.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a bit of a rough end of the stick for this government to suddenly cut the bounty, a year before it was due to be phased out, on this shipbuilding operation in Tasmania. It will mean a 15 per cent increase in price on the average ship coming out of that shipbuilding facility in Tasmania. At the moment, one catamaran&mdash;80 metres or more in length&mdash;comes out of the slips every eight or 10 weeks. The price of those goes up by 15 per cent, or $5 million. It makes it much more difficult to sell them on the world market where there is competition, from European shipbuilders in particular. So it does make a real difference, particularly when the companies built the past government's commitment on this into their future sales program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> I will be voting against this legislation. I will be voting for the interests of this bright spot in the Tasmanian economic profile. Let me say straight off that I do not see eye to eye with Bob Clifford on many things. I have not heard him contributing very much to the defence of Tasmania's environmental well being, the major natural asset of the island these days in generating jobs and business. I do not think he is particularly forward in defending Green ideals.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UNKNOWN">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Watson)</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Brown, try to link the two issues in some way to make your comments a little bit more relevant.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QD4">Senator BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, thank you. I thank the government spokesperson for that because what I have just said now gives breathing space to the Tasmanian senators opposite to really have more time to consider changing their minds as far as the bounty is concerned. So it has been a very constructive little session and I feel really chuffed about having been able to send that message across the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6377"> The subsidy that goes to seafarers in Australian waters is being cut by this piece of legislation. It is a subsidy that is roughly equivalent to reimbursing the employers with the amount that their employees are taxed, as far as taxation is concerned. It is a pretty vital subsidy because it ensures that we have maximum opportunity to employ Australian sea farers and to keep Australian interest in shipping around our coasts and elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A fortnight ago the workplace relations bill went through this place. That legislation cut the ability of maritime unions to come to the defence of people who float into Australian ports on ships of shame that are in appalling conditions and owned under flags of convenience elsewhere. We know that those conditions range from subsistence levels on board ships and people not being paid for months or even years on end to the extraordinary physical abuse of seafarers to the point where some who have stuck up for their rights have disappeared overboard overnight&mdash;an appalling situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's legislation, supported by the Australian Democrats as it was, on that occasion cut the muscle of unions in Australia to go to the defence of these unfortunate seafarers coming into our waters. This piece of legislation cuts the muscle of employers of seafarers in Australia to be able to maximise their opportunity to keep Australians in those jobs under standards that we would accept as being reasonable in this day and age.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that the employment levels on shipping around Australia have dropped to internationally acceptable levels. There is no doubt that the standards of work conditions of Australian seafarers are better than those of a great number of ships floating into our ports. There is no doubt that in the absence of international arrangements we are doing the right thing by subsidising and fostering seafarers' welfare through the existing legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I oppose a change to that legislation which is simply going to flow on to an increase of the number of ships of shame coming into our ports, the advantage that they have and the subsistence conditions that they allow people to work under. At the same time, that change will cut out the potential to employ Australians to work the ships on our coastline under proper conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I would like to reiterate what Senator Schacht said this morning in this place. In relation to the environment and the economy, you would think that the government would back shipping around Australia. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Whichever way you look at it, it is a cheaper form of transport for cargo. But, environmentally, in terms of contributions to greenhouse gases, as Senator Schacht said, it is a far superior way of transporting cargo than rail, which in turn is a far superior method than road transport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is this government doing? It is subsidising road transport to the teeth, it is removing government assistance to rail and it is abolishing government assistance to sea transport. For a government that beats its chest about having a concern for the environment, it is going exactly the wrong way. For those reasons, I oppose the legislation and I will be supporting the Greens amendments.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank all senators who have contributed to the debate. I want to pick up one point that Senator Schacht made in relation to an issue which I think would be of interest to many Australians. He said that it would undermine Australia's defence preparedness. It is a point that his colleague Senator Bob Collins made in the Senate committee. The Royal Australian Navy clearly does discuss these matters with the merchant marine, but the reality of the Australian shipping fleet these days is that it is made up mostly of bulk carriers and the sorts of ships that the RAN would require in a defence emergency or conflict are basically cargo handling ships.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Senator Schacht interjecting</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="H15">Senator CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The RAN's advice is that those ships are not suitable for their requirements. The RAN have recently acquired two second-hand support ships from the United States Navy. This recognises their need to be self-sufficient, the changing nature of the Australian fleet and the fact that much of that fleet is not suitable for defence emergency uses. In the government's view, the suggestion that the withdrawal of these grant schemes will adversely affect Australia's defence capability is a furphy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe the Democrats' position, which was probably more accurately reflected in the proposed amendment they withdrew, would continue a system that has proved to be a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6378"> failure. In spite of the hundreds of millions of dollars that have gone into this scheme over the past few years on the promise that that would encourage greater productivity and reform within Australian shipping&mdash;which is vital to this nation&mdash;it has failed simply because the MUA in particular has always held out promises in relation to the deals given to it by the previous government. The Labor government handed over the money and, of course, the promises of reforms and productivity gains that were made as part of those deals were illusory; they were withdrawn once the cheque had arrived in the mail. The coalition government believes a different approach should be taken because the previous government's approach failed. The Democrat amendment to remove proposed sections 1 and 2 of the bill would basically ensure that the status quo remained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know whether this has been indicated to Senator Margetts and Senator Brown, but the coalition is quite happy with and prepared to agree to the second reading amendment. We believe that at part (a) the amendment is broadly compatible with the actions already undertaken by the government. The coalition, in its shipping policy, is committed to increasing international action towards greater levels of compliance with international safety and shipping standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part (b) is also broadly compatible with the government's commitment to environmental protection. The proposal to pursue compensation for pollution and the proposed actions to be taken to address human rights violations are compatible with the general principle that the polluter or violator pays. So we are happy to support that. Part (c) proposes an annual report that, as far as we are concerned, would not impose an unreasonable demand upon the government; we are also happy to support that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government amendment to this bill was originally provided in the form of a request for amendment.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not, however, the practice followed by the Senate in the past. A request has been required only if the amendment would add to expenditure by comparison with the status quo. Where a bill would reduce expenditure and an amendment would limit the reduction, but not increase expenditure under the status quo, such an amount has been treated as not requiring a request. The rationale for this is that the relevant constitutional provision, the third paragraph of section 53, refers to an amendment which would increase a proposed charge or burden on the people and clearly does not relate to an amendment which merely limits a proposed reduction of existing expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate has not accepted the contrary theory of the government drafters. The application and interpretation of the constitutional provision was recently reported on by the Procedure Committee. Under the recommendations of the committee, this amendment would not be a request. It should be noted that the amendment would also not be a request under the recommendations of the House of Representatives committee which considered the application of section 53. The proposed request for amendment has therefore been treated as an amendment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Obviously, the opposition will be supporting this amendment. This amendment is a government backdown. The government realised when they first introduced this legislation back in May of this year that they had made a classic error; they were discriminating against three ships that were already on order&mdash;one by BHP, one by Shell and one by Mackay Sugar.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment is now being put by the government to allow these three ships to claim support. It is quite reasonable to speculate that this is happening not only because of the opposition and the outcry in the industry about what would have been very unfair treatment but also because of some elements of the National Party, particularly Senator Boswell. I suspect this is a victory for him. To get this through, he probably jumped up and down and danced on the throat of his own minister, the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that three ships already on order and under construction would have lost eligibility for the ships grant shows you the lunacy and the idiocy of the initial proposal. Our only difficulty and our only disappointment is that, when the government was having its fingers stomped on by Senator Boswell&mdash;metaphorically that is&mdash;to restore eligibility for the grant to the Mackay Sugar ship, it did not realise that, with this bill, it had put before us a very misguided measure that would punish both the company side and the seafarers' side of the Australian maritime shipping industry. We will support the amendment, but the amendment shows that this whole measure was ill conceived right from the beginning.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you. What became very clear early on in this inquiry was that the government, fuelled by excessive zeal from Treasury, had in fact overreached itself. It had imposed a penalty on BHP, Shell and Mackay Sugar&mdash;the three Australian companies that have been mentioned. If such a thing existed as a contract between the private sector and the government, the government explicitly broke that contract. It did so by dishonouring undertakings that had been previously given for the construction of these three vessels.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the three companies&mdash;BHP, Shell and Mackay Sugar&mdash;let the contracts to their foreign yards in the Netherlands and in the Republic of Korea for these vessels, they let them on the understanding that the ships capital grants scheme would apply. The basis on which they could afford those contracts in the first place was that that provision would stand. What the government proposed by its original bill was to dishonour those contracts and visit on those three companies a significant financial penalty. It did so in the name of budget savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On this occasion we have seen internal considerations within the coalition. My colleague Senator Schacht has referred to the role of the National Party in this. Certainly, press reports would strongly support what Senator Schacht has said. I am not entirely sure whether Senator Boswell was the leader of the charge, but certainly press reports would support the role of the National Party in this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On this occasion, the government now moves to correct a wrong they would have inflicted on this industry. The sad truth is that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6382"> this is not the only area in which the excessive zeal in the eternal hunt for savings by Treasury is visiting a wrong on industry. There are a number of other areas. Those  bills are on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>&mdash;the bounties legislation bill, Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) and a number of other bills which are in the pipeline and in which the same principle of `don't worry about the punishment meted out to industry; just take the savings when you can' is being applied. I would hope that the government, in being sensible on this matter, would exhibit the same degree of commonsense on the other bills as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In one sense this principle is meting out a financial penalty on Australian industry, but in a very real sense it is taking jobs off Australians. The interesting thing here is, of course, that the government is going to pay a subsidy for the construction of ships to be built in foreign shipyards. In the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill 1996, the government is removing a payment for ships constructed in Australian shipyards. While I strongly support the amendment that is being put to the government; nonetheless, a bill that is in the list will penalise Australian shipbuilders while this amendment will advantage foreign shipbuilders. I just think there is something rotten in the state of industry policy when that type of situation applies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased that on this occasion the Senate committee's role in uncovering what was a serious penalty to be imposed on Australian industry worked and that the committee played an important part in changing the government's mind. I hope that remains true and I hope the principle the government is adopting in this amendment, which we support, it will adopt when those other pieces of legislation come before this Senate. If it does not, we will certainly remind the government of it. Certainly, I expect that industry will too because, as I have said, jobs are at risk. Those jobs are in Tasmania, Western Australia and South Australia in the shipbuilding industry. In this case, these jobs are in the Netherlands and in South Korea. I support the amendment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to indicate the support of the Democrats for this amendment. I did want to make some comments because I think Senator Schacht is right: Senator Ron Boswell did have to jump up and down on this one. He would never have achieved that if it had not been for the fact that the opposition parties showed very clearly that they were going to do something about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What happened was that Ron, as usual when he could not get his own way inside the government, came to us and we gave him the assistance he needed. I am not sure whether the National Party really ought to shift across.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;National Democrats Labor&mdash;whatever. However, we were glad to do it because we saw the sense in this and we saw the absolute nonsense of what was being proposed by the government, to betray once again the value adding to a rural industry, which is represented by particularly the ship which Mackay Sugar had put in place, a very high-tech piece of equipment that will be involved in value adding to the product on the high seas. I am not sure what that does for Australian workers, but I guess as long as they are Australian seamen that certainly is to be commended.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We support this particular amendment. The tragedy for me is, however, that there are so many other good measures undertaken by the former government which assist in value adding to primary products, assist in providing rural development and assist in providing regional jobs. Unfortunately, Senator Boswell has not been able to jump hard enough to get some of those changed. I mention things like the ethanol bounty, which has gone out the door, and taxation assistance for farmer cooperatives. Can you think of a worse proposition than taking away from the farming cooperatives the tax incentive which enables them to be competitive in a cut&hyphen;throat <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6383"> industry&mdash;whether we are talking about the sugar industry, the dairy industry or a number of other industries where cooperatives are absolutely essential?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think I am saying to Senator Boswell: you had better get your jumping boots on because you have still got some more work to do in helping rural industry, particularly the value adding part of rural industry, and if you cannot achieve it then you had better come and see us again. I guess, in the end, you had better come and cross over because that might be the only way you can rescue yourselves and the farming sector as well.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on behalf of the opposition. This is a very flimsy bill. There are three pages in total, and that is symbolic of this government's commitment to vocational education and training. It is practically non&hyphen;existent. We should not be surprised by this, nor should we be fooled by it because the impact of this bill is quite dramatic. Those three pages reflect the impact of two budget decisions which will fall heavily on the TAFE sector: the elimination of the five per cent real growth provided by the previous Labor government and the imposition of a five per cent efficiency dividend on TAFE funding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill amends the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act 1992, which provides the bulk of funding for vocational education, to increase funding by $13.4 million in the first year, 1996, but to reduce it by $58.6 million in 1997. The change for 1996 simply reflects the impact of price changes. However, the adjustment for 1997 reflects the net impact of the budget decisions to which I have referred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Examination of this legislation gives us a clearer picture of what the government really has in mind for vocational education and training. Stripped of the rhetoric, we notice that the two budget measures reflected in this bill cut vocational education funding by $91 million and $66 million respectively over the four years of the forward estimates. This, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6385"> together with other savings measures such as the cuts to the Australian National Training Authority, well and truly exceeds the additional funding available through the so&hyphen;called modern Australian apprenticeship and training system. In addition to that, massive cuts are being made to labour market programs which will have a major impact on the TAFE colleges, not to mention the impact on the chances of unemployed people acquiring the necessary skills to obtain a job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before the election, we heard from the coalition endless assurances about the future of TAFE. We were told that under the coalition's policy, as detailed by statements made in its schools and TAFE policy document, a Howard government would:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . continue to support a strong and effective TAFE sector, that is, the publicly funded network of TAFE institutions and the thousands of students and teachers involved in the system.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>The same document notes this commitment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . ensure that the network of TAFE institutions, especially in rural areas and regional centres, will not be undermined.</PARA>
<PARA>Further, it states that a coalition government would do this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in conjunction with the States and Territories develop a National Plan for TAFE.</PARA>
<PARA>It does not take long to work out the difference an election makes. What news did the budget bring for TAFE? The news was almost uniformly bad. TAFE is being expected to absorb an even bigger efficiency dividend than other recipients of Commonwealth own purpose outlays and specific purpose payments. The burden on TAFE is five per cent from the first year, while the general impost is three per cent in the first year and an additional one per cent applied cumulatively for each succeeding year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The result of this funding cut will be felt both in recurrent and capital activities. It is likely that funds made available to ANTA for national projects will be halved, while interstate cooperation projects will cease altogether. National projects include research and evaluation, training, market development, some equity measures and curriculum development. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rationale for all these changes to interstate cooperative projects and various other things is that they ought to be funded under bilateral agreements between the states. Regardless of whether it can be argued that there is no justification for special funding for projects which cross state borders, it is nevertheless possible, even probable, that alternative funding will not be found for some projects and that some worthwhile activities will cease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The wide area learning project, for example, which is a joint New South Wales-Queensland venture, involves the delivery of services to isolated and disadvantaged communities with little or no previous access to further education and training. The Wali Palyantjaku Building Houses project in South Australia provides training in the building industry for Aboriginal communities living in remote areas. It is another example of a project the funding for which will stop altogether. There will also be cuts in capital funding, with a significant fall from $227.644 million in 1996 to $200 million in 1997. This is the government's so&hyphen;called commitment to TAFE at work at the grassroots level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government would have us believe that it has embarked on a revolutionary form of vocational education and that not one useful initiative happened before 2 March 1996. It is very interesting to note that the minister has yet again provided the usual divergence. He put out a press release today repackaging all the budget measures in such a way as to make it appear that there is something new. It was a very transparent device to take public attention away from the discussion in the Senate here today. The same pattern has emerged time and again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that education was a high priority under Labor during the entire 13 years of Labor government. Major policy development in vocational education and training has taken place, particularly since 1990, when the Commonwealth moved towards assuming a greater role in ensuring the coordinated development of our national vocational education and training schemes. Labor's policy development and national leadership were underpinned by the provision <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6386"> of sufficient funds to meet the stated goals. Labor put its money where its mouth was. Labor committed $1.65 billion in growth funds to the VET sector between 1992 and 1997. That was designed to generate an additional 792,000 places in vocational education and training. During its period in office, the Labor government provided a 56 per cent real increase in funding for TAFE and other forms of vocational education and training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the time of the change of government, a range of activities was already under way. There was a broad national framework and agreement on how the Australian vocational training system should be progressed. A major body of work was being undertaken under the auspices of ANTA to develop courses and curricula to make them consistent with Australian vocational training scheme principles. It was about developing a competency base and a more flexible set of arrangements so that courses could be more flexibly delivered in contexts other than the traditional college environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Contrary to what the current government would have us believe, the needs of schools in the provision of vocational education received a significant amount of attention. The Labor government committed $38 million to the Australian Student Traineeship Foundation, which was designed to support initiatives to provide vocational education and work experience for school students. The jobs pathway guarantee was designed to assist young people's transition from school to work. On the basis of these programs and others, the number of schools with year 12 retention rates grew to well over 70 per cent. Most of these students were not necessarily destined for university. These schools have an important role to play in the delivery of vocational education. We support the proposal to earmark $20 million per year in ANTA funds for use by schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also supportive of moves to try to rationalise the whole system of course recognition and the relationship of course with competency standards developed by the national training bodies, or so-called ITABS. It is envisaged that the ITABS will have a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> greater role not only in the development of standards but also in other areas of curriculum development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A major potential problem with the government's approach, however, lies in its faith in the user&hyphen;choice concept. This is the market based approach rearing its ugly head yet again. It is based on the notion that training will be far more relevant if it is more closely attuned to industry needs. When taken too far, however, with industry too much in charge of the direction, we could end up with training that is specific to particular firms. Our vocational education and training system must retain the capacity to provide broad generic competencies that have application across a range of jobs and pathways. It should ensure that workers have skills that are transferable between jobs and not specific to any one job or, more especially, any one firm.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will be watching the development of the policy framework to ensure that suitable safeguards prevent a situation where public funds provided for vocational education and training end up being just another kind of industry subsidy. That is an important issue, particularly as firms wind back their commitment to training their employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to address the way in which the massive cuts to labour market programs have been interacting with other vocational education and training. A report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald </EMPHASIS>of 7 October 1996 quoted the New South Wales Minister for Education and Training as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">TAFE institutes have estimated the cuts to labour market programs over the next four years will cost each of them between $2 million and $6 million this financial year, and put at risk 340 full-time teaching positions . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Institutes in Sydney's west, where about 41 labour market programs were operating last year, would lose 914 student places, while institutes on the North Coast would lose 2777.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>This demonstrates the utter foolishness of this government in being unable to properly fund our education system in the first place and then not provide the resources to give skills to people who are unlikely to find jobs without them. Such actions will flow on and themselves reduce job opportunities. The ALP <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6387"> seeks to amend the motion for the second reading of this bill. I move:</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> is of the opinion that the vocational education and training system has an increasingly vital role in providing Australia's young people with skills appropriate to the changing workplace; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> condemns the Government:</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" RIGHT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> (ii) <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> for clearly failing to meet its election commitments to `continue to support a strong and effective TAFE sector' and to `ensure that the network of TAFE institutions, especially in rural areas and regional centres, will not be undermined'."</PARA>
<PARA>I might indicate that the opposition is truly very disturbed about the manner in which this government is pressing about with its educational policies. As with so many educational areas, the coalition seems intent upon winding back the Commonwealth's national leadership role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as we are concerned, education had a much higher priority during the 13 years of Labor government than this government is prepared to acknowledge. This government has quite deliberately sought, through its budget policies, to reduce its financial commitment to the education and training sector within overall government initiatives. What we are seeing here is an attempt being made by this government to undermine the major policy development that was undertaken by Labor, particularly since 1990 when the Commonwealth moved towards assuming a much greater role in ensuring the coordinated development of our national vocational education and training scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">National leadership was what underpinned that policy development. It was underpinned further by a commitment of $1.65 billion in growth funds to the VET sector between 1992 and 1997. It was designed to generate an <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> additional 792,000 places in the vocational education and training sectors. During its period in government, Labor provided increases of some 56 per cent in the funding for vocational education and training in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Such a vocation is fundamental to any government that seeks to maintain that it truly has national leadership aspirations in this area. Such a commitment and such a vision is not shared by this government, which makes Labor's record shine by comparison. I am very disappointed to see that this government has pursued such a reckless and negative policy in this area.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats echo many of the concerns that have been put forward today by the opposition and by Senator Carr. Indeed, it is rather a black week for education and training in this place. Earlier today we saw regressive changes to schools policy and funding passed by the Senate in the guise of more choice for parents, but what we are seeing in actuality is a continuation by this government of a shift of public funds to the private sector. I hope that is something we will not see in this place next week when we deliberate changes to the higher education sector which, again, represent cuts to education funding in this nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill before us today amends the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act and it changes the legislated funding levels for ANTA in 1996, 1997 and 1998. I note that the increase in ANTA funding for 1996 is around $13.4 million. Of course, the Australian Democrats support that increase. It is apparently a supplement to the already legislated funding level and, I believe, reflects the increase in average weekly earnings and general inflationary pressures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, if we go on, we see that massive cuts will be taking place in ANTA's funding in 1997 and 1998. This government has decided to cut funding for ANTA in 1997 by close to $57.5 million. I note that this cut will pretty well be retained into the following year, 1998. Those cuts give us great reason to question this government's commitment to vocational education and training in this <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6388"> country&mdash;to question its commitment to that sector, along with the other sectors such as primary and secondary education and higher education, which have already faced substantial funding cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, we find it very difficult to understand why this government would seek to make such cuts in 1997, virtually retaining this cut into 1998, when something like 8.7 per cent of Australians are still without a job. Cutting funding for vocational education and training at a time when we are confronted with high employment levels, with especially high levels of youth unemployment, in this country does not make sense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I understand it, the $57.5 million that will be cut from ANTA in 1997 consists basically of a five per cent efficiency dividend. That jargon is something we are hearing increasingly from this government&mdash;the notion of an efficiency dividend. It is being applied to TAFE and, of course, there is also the elimination of the five per cent growth in ANTA funding which was introduced by the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should add that the Democrats played an important role in ensuring that the ANTA legislation was passed by the previous government in 1992. We promised then to hold them accountable when it came to ensuring that there were sufficient funds allocated for vocational education and training in this country. We intend to do the same with this government as well. I am only sorry, as I say, to see that they are cutting those funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What exactly does this government mean by an efficiency dividend? Is it really a genuine incentive and a viable tool for encouraging unruly departments to increase their productivity by perhaps increasing their efficiency levels, or is it just another nice piece of jargon to justify cutting public expenditure? In this case, I am not quite sure. That leads me to a further question. Is it reasonable to expect that five per cent worth of inefficiencies in the area of vocational education and training are actually there to be found and to be cut when, as I said, so many Australians are out of work?</PARA>
