<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to Senator Short. Yesterday in the Senate your colleague Senator Parer failed to give a commitment to maintain the export market development grant scheme. In a speech to the ACCI on 15 May you conceded that some successful government programs would have to be wound back or scrapped, even where such programs are `meeting a relevant objective effectively and efficiently'. Will you inform the Senate where you rate in terms of priority the export market development grant scheme? Has the scheme been meeting its objective of facilitating the growth of exports by Australian small businesses both effectively and efficiently? Will the minister guarantee the operation of the scheme in its current form?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, Senator Sherry is correct and has quoted correctly from my speech to the ACCI last week. Your question reveals much more about the opposition than it does about the government, because it reflects that Labor continues to hold a deficit mentality. You people seem to have a deficit fixation or deficit disorder requiring some professional treatment. You seem to believe that Australia can afford each and every program put forward by the plethora of groups in our community which argue that their programs are worthwhile.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> It is now 10 years since the banana republic and Labor has learnt absolutely nothing about that. The question I would ask Senator Sherry is, just where does the opposition stand on the question of getting the books of this nation back into balance? If you look at what the shadow Treasurer said in the House of Representatives last night, you would quite rightly feel rather confused because during the debate on the appropriation bill in the House of Representatives last night the shadow Treasur er made a very enlightening comment. He said:</PARA>

In that context many situations are under review and the answer to those questions will be revealed at the time of the budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question that opposition senators have to answer is, do they want to continue to run a continuing budget deficit that leads to higher interest rates, less jobs, more unemployment, lower economic growth and less international competitiveness? That is the path you led Australia down in the last 13 years. Yesterday the shadow Treasurer admitted that it was a matter of deliberate policy.

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;How is your six&hyphen;week taxpayer funded holiday coming along? It's about time your got on the front bench and did a bit of work. I will read to you what he said. He said this:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We frankly are prepared to debate the Telstra legislation in the normal way when it comes up.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, he said he had an open mind on the subject. That, of course, is in absolute contradistinction with what Senator Faulkner had to say when he let the cat out of the bag on 1 May. In moving an amendment to the Address&hyphen;in&hyphen;Reply, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate is of the opinion that no part of Telstra should be sold. I believe that selling part or all of our communications carrier would be an act of gross irresponsibility in itself. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, he had absolutely made up his mind. There was no basis upon which he was prepared to do anything other than vote against this legislation. This was perfectly consistent with Senator Evans' point of view&mdash;which, perhaps, was what they both had in mind at that time. Lest there be any doubt about it, let's look at what Senator Bourne had to say on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">World Today</EMPHASIS>  today at 12 o'clock. She was asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Will you vote for the privatisation of Telstra under some circumstances?</PARA>
<PARA>Her answer:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No, absolutely not.</PARA>
<PARA>There you have it. The two biggest opposition parties in this place have absolutely made up their minds that they do not support the privatisation of Telstra under any circumstances. Yet what are we facing now? We are facing at least a three&hyphen;month adjournment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will tell you something very interesting that I discovered only late last night. I thought there might have been some powerful reason why this legislation needed to be referred to a committee. But do you know why it is being referred? You have only to listen to what Senator Schacht had to say. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You have not exempted this new organisation from the Corporations Law which provides that minority shareholders have to be equally represented by all directors.</PARA>
<PARA>He is absolutely wrong because there are shareholder oversight provisions in the bill. When I pointed this out to him, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I may not have the details perfectly correct but I bet a lot of other people do not either. These are the sorts of issues that have to be debated in the community. . . </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the reason this bill is going off to a committee is that Senator Schacht wants to take a refresher course. He was not prepared to read the bill to find out what it was about. If he had, he would understand that it has all the necessary consumer protections.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You do not understand the first thing about this. You have this quaint notion that somehow, when you remove the right to direction, Telstra will have to act in a commercial way. Let me explain to you that five years ago you corporatised Telstra; in other words, ever <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="775"> since that day it has been required to act commercially. It has done that perfectly consistently with its community service obligation to ensure that services are reasonably available on an equitable basis. It will continue to do that. No&hyphen;one has ever suggested that it should not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an absolute tragedy and a monumental hypocrisy for both of the two major opposition parties to have made up their minds. I note that they are quite comfortable in being called the `opposition parties' these days; it is no longer `the other mob and the Democrats'. There is Senator Bourne revelling in it. The opposition parties are lying in the same dishonest bed together. They have made up their minds. They are not interested in debate. Nonetheless, they are prepared to deliberately flout the will of the people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You know that this was a very controversial and, I think, brave and commendable initiative that we took to the last election. No&hyphen;one laid a glove on us during that campaign. There has been no significant community concern expressed. Now you have the hide to deliberately frustrate the program.

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="656">Senator FORSHAW</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  on 14 May in an article entitled `Learning earns its keep', Professor John Niland, the Vice&hyphen; Chancellor of the University of New South Wales, commented:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A 10 per cent cut in funding translated through to student load would reduce exports by over $130 million.</PARA>
<PARA>Does the minister agree with Professor Niland's assessment? Further, given that higher education exports generate in excess of $1.3 billion a year, can the minister inform the Senate as to the likely effects on our overseas earnings of the proposed cuts to the higher education sector that she has advised to the university vice&hyphen;chancellors?</PARA></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="775" SPEAKER="Vanstone, Sen Amanda" NAMEID="7E4" ELECTORATE="SA" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The article referred to and many, many others that we have seen over the last couple of weeks represent a fearmongering campaign by some people in the higher education sector to try to ensure that the higher education sector makes no contribution, or a very minimal contribution, to the enormous budgetary savings task that faces not only this government but also the nation as a whole. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Some people in the higher education sector would prefer that that sector made no contribution whatsoever, or a very minimal contribution, to that budgetary <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="776"> savings task. There may be some self-interest there, and I would expect people involved in higher education to be promoting and advocating its benefits, in the sense of what it provides to Australians domestically and the opportunities it provides for export.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Forshaw may well know, those export opportunities are not limited to the higher education sector. The TAFE sector also has a big involvement in the export of education. The particular article referring to a specific nominated savings target or cut, as some people might like to refer to it, is just another example of scaremongering in the higher education sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One thing needs to be made abundantly clear: this government does understand the value of the higher education sector, the contribution it makes to students in Australia and the opportunities it creates for exports. We understand the enormous size of the black hole left to us by the previous government. We are determined to do something about fixing that black hole. It is very difficult to see that a sector such as the higher education sector could reasonably expect to be completely left out of this process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to once again make clear what the higher education sector has been told. I met with the Australian Vice&hyphen;Chancellors Board and the Australian Vice&hyphen;Chancellors Committee in full and with the union. They have all been given this message: `Firstly, there is an enormous budgetary problem. Secondly, as the minister responsible for your area, I would be deceiving you if I led you to conclude in any way whatsoever that you could expect to come out of this unscathed, that you will not have to make any contribution at all, that we will take it from somewhere else.' What is being asked here? Is it that higher education be left alone and more come from schools or social security? Is it that everyone else should bear the burden of the black hole that has been left to us by the previous government? I do not think people in higher education are saying that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point has been made to these people that the government wants to approach this savings task as calmly and rationally and carefully as possible, which is why we have <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> had a series of meetings. People have been asked to put forward contributions as to the shape of the savings for the higher education sector. I deeply regret that those best in a position to put forward that contribution are at the moment choosing to take a very destructive, rather than constructive, role for that sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I still look forward to people involved in the higher education sector putting forward some positive proposals for the best way to contribute to the budgetary savings task which Australia has been burdened with by the previous government.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Robert Hill. By way of introduction, I would like to say that the government will earn the support of 66 per cent of Australians if it stops the sale of Telstra but I wish to refer more specifically to an area where the government will not earn any support&mdash;that is, the crippling cuts to the Commonwealth Ombudsman's office. Is the minister aware that from June 1996 the Ombudsman will be forced to cease agency arrangements with the Tasmanian Ombudsman with all calls diverted to Melbourne and cease outreach programs to indigenous Australians, non-English speaking people and rural areas or will be forced to severely curtail the intercept audit function of the Australian Federal Police and the NCA under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act? I ask the minister: how can he justify these cuts which will prevent many Australians from accessing the government when the government's own departments are incompetent or engaged in maladministration?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the honourable senator invites me to make some comment on the sale or part sale of Telstra, which I am happy to do because it would be in the best interests of this nation. Out of that sale, we would have the opportunity to transfer part of the capital investment in Telstra, firstly, into the environment&mdash;a $1 billion natural trust fund&mdash;and, secondly, we hope, in repayment of public debt, $7 billion, which will enable us to keep interest rates down and help small <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="778"> business to grow and to employ the currently mass unemployed Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the second part of your question on the Ombudsman&mdash;and I thank you for giving me some notice of the detail of this even though it was late notice&mdash;the best information that I have been able to get to help you is as follows. The government is aware that the Ombudsman has decided to cease her agency arrangement with the Tasmanian Ombudsman. How the Ombudsman manages her office resources is a matter for her to determine. We understand that there were few complainants who took the opportunity to make complaints in person, rather most wrote or telephoned. The Ombudsman will retain a free call facility for Tasmanian residents. They will, of course, still be able to write to her.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am advised further that the Ombudsman's outreach arrangements to ethnic and indigenous communities are relatively recent. Again, it is for her to determine whether they should continue and at what level. The position in relation to the inspection of records of telecommunications interceptions by the Australian Federal Police and the National Crime Authority is slightly different. The Ombudsman has a statutory responsibility to carry out that function and has been provided with resources to enable her to perform it.</PARA></ANSWER>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a very simple answer to that question. On the occasions when I have discussed with higher education people&mdash;including the vice&hyphen;chancellors&mdash;the very difficult task that we face in terms of meeting the budget savings that will be required to address the black hole left by the Labor government, I have tried to elicit from particularly the vice&hyphen;chancellors what the most sensible way is for the government to go about this task. These are the people who are running Australia's universities. These are the people who undoubtedly have enormous expertise in the higher education sector. These are the people to whom any government would turn to ask: how do you believe the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="779"> government can best approach the savings task we have?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On these occasions, the vice&hyphen;chancellors, in particular, have been extraordinarily reluctant to come forward with a group view as to how this ought to be done. There has been a lot of headshaking. There has been a lot of rumourmongering in the papers. But not one positive proposal has been put by the vice&hyphen;chancellors with respect to a suggestion as to how the government could best find these savings in the higher education sector. In other words, the attitude has been, `Do not take it from us; we must be completely untouched. If you have a budgetary problem, take it from other people. Leave the higher education sector out of it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On a number of occasions I have made it clear to the vice&hyphen;chancellors that the prospect of cutting student numbers is the least attractive prospect available. It is a very, very unattractive prospect. But let me underline this: none of the task of putting the budget back into the black is going to be attractive. Who would want to come into government and find an $8 billion black hole? Who, but the irresponsible pack sitting opposite, would leave government with that sort of deficit?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not pretend that the task of getting the budget back into black is an easy one. I do not think it is an enjoyable one at all. The difference between this side of the chamber and that side of the chamber is that we will not walk away from the responsibility to get the budget back into black. This is a very difficult task. It is a matter of national interest that our economy is brought back into line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we get the budget back into black, one group in my portfolio that will be most advantaged is the group currently most disadvantaged: people without a job. I am not going to walk away from the responsibility of my portfolio and other portfolios to contribute to meeting that savings black hole that has been created by Labor. It is in the national interest that we meet it. There will be arguments of specific self&hyphen;interest. We will just have to deal with them. We will have to keep wading on with the task, because it is a task that must be completed. I repeat that the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people who it will most advantage are the most disadvantaged people in my portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other end of my portfolio deals with the people who are the most advantaged people, one could argue, in Australia: the people who have the opportunity to work and participate in higher education. They clearly are far more advantaged than many other Australians. I regret that the case that has been put by these people at the moment is, `Not us. Get it from someone else.' That is what I am being told. I frankly think it is an irresponsible attitude, with respect to the national interest and higher education, for them to avoid their responsibility to contribute to that task. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></ANSWER>

Jennie George was going around too saying that Australian women would become sweated labour if a coalition government was elected to office.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nevertheless, when it comes to what she had to say the other day about the Labor Party's seriousness about getting women into parliament, I do believe that she was pretty right. She said she thinks that there is disaffection among women voters and the contrast with the number of women members of parliament in the government ranks now makes the task far more urgent for Labor. She said when men's power and privilege are threatened, they do not really open the doors to embrace other people having a go. Having been an unsuccessful candidate herself, she speaks from experience there. That does not seem to be a problem in the coalition.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Yes, it is a very good question indeed because it highlights in a very stark way the difference between the positive attitude of this government towards those self-funded retirees, the elderly citizens in our community who have worked and saved very hard for their retirements, and the niggardly, negative attitude that Labor showed towards them during its 13 years in government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government recognises the vital contribution that self-funded retirees have made to the Australian community during their working lives, and during their retirement lives as well. They rely solely or partly on income <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="786"> from investments such as shares and interest earned on savings in order to accumulate that capital. As I said, they have worked hard and they have saved hard throughout their working lives. They exercised discipline and they deserve as recognition of that discipline, hard work and saving, proper, fair and equitable treatment by government. That is a treatment they did not receive under 13 years of Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the election campaign, the now government announced that the pensioner rebate would be extended to self-funded retirees of pensionable age with annual incomes below the level where the pensioner rebate cut out. That tax incentive will benefit thousands of self-funded retirees throughout Australia&mdash;those retirees that Labor ignored. The initiative announced during the campaign is due to commence in the income year beginning on 1 July 1996. The election commitment indicated that that measure would be delivered through a tax rebate which will be claimed at the end of the financial year. The cost of that measure to revenue is $70 million per year and is a very important redressing of the unfairness and inequity that existed under the Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This initiative is in addition to a number of other initiatives that we announced during the campaign which will also provide tax assistance to self-funded retirees&mdash;the reduction in the provisional tax uplift factor from eight per cent to six per cent, the legislation for which is currently in the parliament, the tax rebate on interest income and the tax incentive for private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So far as the second part of Senator Watson's question is concerned, as I have said, under Labor self-funded retirees did not receive equitable tax treatment compared with pensioners on similar incomes. Rather than recognise their contribution, Labor penalised them through the tax system. Whereas pensioners received specific tax relief through a tax rebate, this rebate was not available for self-funded retirees and generally those self-funded retirees would have paid tax on every cent they earned over $5,400. They were also promised l&hyphen;a&hyphen;w law tax cuts&mdash;tax cuts which <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> never materialised. Then when Labor magically turned tax cuts into superannuation entitlements it cheated the self-funded retirees again because self&hyphen;funded retirees are already retired and were never eligible.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, Mr Evans, what's Labor's tactic in this, especially in the Senate. I understand now that because of Robert Hill's ironically cut off motion, it could well be that this Bill doesn't get debated in this session.</PARA>
<PARA>Gareth Evans said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, if it doesn't get debated this session, it will be largely because of the extraordinary cynicism that's being displayed by the present Government leadership in the Senate who are now behaving in all the ways they accused us of behaving in our worst and most cynical moments previously, and the biter does occasionally get bit. But look, we frankly are prepared to debate the Telstra legislation in the normal way when it comes up. We're not going to hang in, in imposing ridiculous constraints on that and we'll just respond to the issues in a measured way as they come forward. We'll debate the Bill on its merits and we'll look at the whole future course of the argument on its merits.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what Mr Gareth Evans said on that program. That is what has occurred in relation to the debate on Telstra, which has taken place in this chamber over the past day or so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that without any involvement by this chamber at all in the Telstra bill, that bill would automatically be deferred to the first day of the budget sittings. That is because there is an order of continuing effect in the Senate, and that order is something that was proposed and supported by the coalition parties when they were in opposition. It is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> something that they argued for very persuasively indeed. Without any decision by the Senate on this matter at all, the Telstra bill would be automatically adjourned till the budget sittings of this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the opposition and the minor parties have said, and what Senator Harradine, I think, is in the process of saying, is this: instead of seeing that cut&hyphen;off motion work in that way, we are proposing a sensible approach that will mean there can be Senate committee consideration of this extremely important piece of legislation over the recess.

That is where the monumental hypocrisy comes in. Senator Faulkner gets up and says, `It is perfectly normal practice to refer bills to committees.' You know what happens. When you refer bills to committees, you do that for a purpose; that is, to see whether the bill can be improved, to flush out some problems that there might be with a view to considering the bill on its merits. But what we have is this absolutely stark position taken at the very beginning of the debate by both of the major opposition parties in this chamber: they are absolutely opposed irrespective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the point of referring a bill off for three months? You do not have the guts to debate it on the merits. You do not have the guts to face up to the consequences of you having slammed the bag on this bill. If you had any political nous, you would have at least pretended you had an open mind, but neither of you is prepared to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what earthly purpose is served by referring this off to a committee? I think we all know the answer to that. You are simply wanting to obstruct this chamber; you are wanting to do all that you possibly can to frustrate our legislative program. You know full well that this bill and these proposals have been exhaustively canvassed during both <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the election campaign and subsequently. About the only concerns you can identify are those from your captive clients; in other words, those in the trade union movement who have an acute vested interest in maintaining the inefficiencies that surround Telstra, who do not for a moment want it to be exposed in the way that it needs to be to real competition, to having a share price that will determine its true value.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are the sorts of things you ought to be debating and exploring in committee. If you were fair dinkum, you would go off to that committee with an open mind. You would look at the arguments and see whether, in fact, they might not just be persuasive. You would have a look at what is going on around the rest of the world, but no&mdash;</PARA>

I have to say that again we got from the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) in his answer today just a heap of bluster about the politics of his proposed legislation. He mentioned in his answer some remarks that I made in the Senate yesterday afternoon. I just want to talk about that debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First of all, when Senator Alston came in and moved the motion on behalf of Senator Kemp, he spoke for 26 minutes. He had no notes; he spoke off the cuff. A number of senators interjected because, when I started interjecting, he actually started a discourse with me, because it was quite clear he had no substance to last for the 30 minutes of time he had allotted. Some senators objected to the fact that I had almost half the time that he was speaking. Why? Because Senator Alston could not explain in detail the reasons for the privatisation of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He had a half hour. He moved the motion, but he could not speak to it. He had to rely on responding to interjections and cross-chamber discourse to try to fill up his half hour. He spoke for 26 minutes. I spoke for nine minutes only, because I wanted to make sure that Senator Harradine had time to speak and declare his position. Senator Alston said that I gave only one reason. He ought to refer to the speech I made on the address-in-reply, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> when I spoke for half an hour, of which 25 minutes was about the Telstra issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Senator Alston accuses us of having a grab bag of terms of reference in the amendment we moved, which it looks like the Senate, the opposition and the minor parties will carry. He did not mention even in his remarks today that one of the fundamental areas we have raised is that you cannot disconnect the amendments to the Telecommunications Act for the post&hyphen;1997 regulatory regime from the privatisation of Telstra. If you did get the privatisation of Telstra through this parliament in the next six months, it would not mean a thing to anybody who wanted to bid for $8 billion, or whatever amount of money. No-one will put a cent up till they know what the rules are for post&hyphen;1 July 1997, because it would only take the Senate or the House of Representatives, this parliament, to change one paragraph of the bill to change the income stream of the privatised Telstra by billions of dollars. Nobody is going to invest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The scoping studies that the minister now has merchant banks doing are not worth anything. The banks will tell him, `We can guess this, we can guess that, but until you tell us what the post&hyphen;1 July regulatory regime will be, we can only guess. We cannot advise investors on what the marketplace will be until we know the rules the parliament will give.' That is a fundamental issue. You cannot disconnect the telecommunications amendment or the Telstra privatisation. That is a major reference in our amendment to this bill.</PARA>

That is why they were set up in that way. It means that the opposition, with only 38 per cent of the senators in this chamber, can bring down a majority report without the concurrence of the Democrat members on the committee and certainly without the concurrence of the government members on the committee. That is the reason why this opposition and the combination of parties decided to send this to a reference committee rather than to a legislation committee, which is where it should rightly go because the legislation has been introduced into this chamber and, as such, should be discussed and looked at by a legislation committee rather than a reference committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only reason you have decided to choose a reference committee is that you know that with 38 per cent of the senators in this chamber you have 50 per cent of the vote, plus a casting vote if you so require it, on those reference committees.

It actually happens to be a matter that they think is pretty important. Month after month, the coalition, in opposition, led the housing industry along the path on this policy, implying that it would be an election commitment. Then a few days before the election they dropped it and they dropped the HIA. I was there to talk about that policy, and I mentioned Telstra briefly in passing. I would have been delighted to spend 40 minutes pointing out why I thought the government had failed to make an economic case for the sale of any of Telstra.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, a bill with substantially the same content to this was introduced to this place by the previous government in November 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the bill lapsed due to the prorogation of parliament this year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Today's bill differs in only two respects from the one introduced by the previous government: (i) the title has been altered and (ii) subitem 4(1), schedule 8 has been deleted because the 30 April 1996 deadline for that particular provision has passed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The previous government's bill introduced a number of measures which would result in significant savings over the next three years. These savings have already been incorporated in the forward estimates.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For this reason, the government is introducing this bill which incorporates these savings measures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, I would like to make it very clear that this step does not provide any indication about what may or may not be the subject of ongoing budget discussions. The results of these discussions will be made public at a later time, and will not be influenced by our decision to introduce this bill now.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, this bill reduces the maximum annual grant from $250,000 to $200,000, providing for fairer distribution of the available funding amongst small and medium exporters. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill introduces the framework for a flexible grants entry test. This will both limit the payment of grants to claimants who are least likely to succeed, and increase the guidance provided to Australia's smaller exporters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The accountability and risk management aspects of the export market development grants scheme will be improved by the other measures contained in the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amount by which a claim for grant can be increased between the time of lodgement and its assessment will be limited. This will reduce the scope for lodgement of ill prepared or ambit claims.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A limit will be placed on the number of EMDG Approved Joint Venture and Consortium (AJVC) of which a "person" may be a member. This will reduce the potential for individual organisations to receive very large amounts of EMDG funding through multiple membership.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Austrade will be given the power to reduce the grant paid to an AJVC claimant to the extent that the claimant has breached the conditions of approval of its AJVC status.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Grants will not be paid where a consultant convicted of fraud or dishonesty offences has prepared the claim, or where the expenditure in the claim is related to illegal activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, Mr President, the act will be amended so that the general prohibition on the payment of grants in relation to  `in house' expenses cannot be circumvented through the use of interposed companies.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill seeks to implement the Coalition Government's promise to set up a Natural Heritage Trust Fund, but in a more responsible and honourable way.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Trust Fund will be used to fund environment programs, but will do so without attaching the creation of the Fund to the sale of any part of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats believe such a vitally important area as environmental funding should come from the Budget. We demonstrate with this bill that if the Government is determined to link Telstra to the environment, it can get a better deal for both through this model which does not involve the sale than with its own controversial proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Maintaining Telstra in public ownership provides such an improvement in public sector finances that 7 per cent of Telstra's profits can be allocated to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> setting up the Natural Heritage Trust Fund while still improving public sector savings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill itself is a fairly simple one.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It establishes a Natural Heritage Trust Fund to be administered by the Minister for Finance in accordance with section 62A of the Audit Act 1901.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the Fund will be to make payments for environmental programs of national significance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for the Environment will nominate environmental programs of national significance to be funded from the Fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Into the fund will be paid 7 per cent of Telstra's pre&hyphen;tax profits for the next five years. By "pre&hyphen;tax", we mean the definition of profit used by the Australian Tax Office with the deduction to apply immediately prior to the tax being taken out. In 1994/5, 7 per cent of pre&hyphen;tax profits would have been about $168 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amounts in the Fund will be invested by the Minister for Finance, with the income to be repaid back into the Trust Account.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also makes provision for Parliament to make future appropriations to give effect to these purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This structure is not unusual in Commonwealth public finance. Indeed, the structure is similar to that established for the Land Fund and several of the agricultural marketing funds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill, if passed, will achieve the objectives of Government policy far better than the alternative of selling Telstra and using part of the proceeds to set up the Fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will be capable of funding more programs. It will leave public sector savings significantly higher than they would be if Telstra was sold. And it retains Telstra in public ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill conclusively demonstrates that it is possible to have both an environment policy and to have Telstra in public ownership while improving fiscal responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is an economically and environmentally responsible proposal which shows up the flaws and shortcomings in the Coalition's proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill is not a "get Telstra" bill. Yes, Telstra will lose access to 7 per cent of its retained profits for 5 years and this will reduce the capital base of the company. The reduction is only marginal, about 1.5 per cent in five years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That 1.5 per cent reduction can be usefully compared with the 5.7 per cent discount at which the Commonwealth sold CSL shares, or the 20 per cent undervaluation on the original tranche of Commonwealth Bank shares. The Democrats believe it is a small price to pay, considering the significant <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="798"> benefits which will accrue to in improved public sector savings and a more sustainable environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our proposal will also marginally reduce the amount of funds Telstra has available for re&hyphen;investment, by about $75 million, compared with Telstra's total capital investments of $3.2 billion. But, as the Coalition itself points out in its environment policy, investment on the environment should itself be seen as capital investment. So while Telstra's capacity for capital investment would be reduced slightly, the net effect would be one of substituting one form of capital investment for another.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is also not a "tax Telstra" bill. Telstra is owned by the Government on behalf of the Australian people. If owners wish to withdraw funds from their own company, for a purpose which the ultimate owners&mdash;in this case, the Australian people&mdash;want, then they are entitled to do so. That is not a `tax'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unlike the Coalition, we do not regard Telstra as a `magic money tree', a tree that can be chopped up and sold off to fit an ideological commitment to smaller Government and short&hyphen;term debt reduction. We regard it as a highly profitable public asset which should be used for the benefit of all Australians, and which will contribute significantly to even greater long term debt reduction..</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We accept that ultimately this bill will marginally reduce the flow of company tax and dividend payments to the Budget. But this is consistent with our view that the Government should have made a decision to stick with funding environment policy from the Budget in the first place and not moved to tie environment funding to the sale of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats and, I believe, the majority of Australians regard the Government's attempt to link the Telstra sale to the funding of the environment programs as little more than a cynical political stunt.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was originally conceived as something of a clever trick during the election campaign, but its has turned out to be huge miscalculation based on two inaccurate and arrogant assumptions. The first is that the Democrats are a single issue environment party. The second is the assumption that the Democrats will cross&hyphen;trade one reasonable policy for an appalling one.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats are certainly committed to the environment. We have an 18 year record to prove it. We have demonstrated how this can be achieved while only maintaining a fiscally responsible deficit reduction program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But, unlike the breathtakingly cynical position of the Coalition, we believe the environment is sufficiently important to stand on its own two feet as a policy area worthy of being funded from the Budget.  <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition's refusal to fund the environment from the Federal Budget reinforces its continuing failure to acknowledge the centrality of the environment to economic and social policy&hyphen;making.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Telstra link also highlights the fact that the Coalition has failed to convince the Australian people there will be substantial benefits flowing to them from the sale of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To make the privatisation poison pill easier to swallow, the Telstra sale has been sugar coated with the promise of using part of the funds to improve the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a link which is unnecessary, cynical and fraudulent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the election campaign, the Coalition made nearly $6 billion worth of election promises across 55 policy areas. Only one of those policy areas&mdash;the environment&mdash;has its funding attached to the sale of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Imagine the outcry if the Coalition had made funding for defence, family assistance or schools contingent upon the sale of Telstra. Such a scenario would be rejected out of hand&mdash;and the fact that the Government has chosen to make environment funding contingent upon the sale of Telstra shows only too clearly its lack of respect for and commitment to the Australian environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This link should be seen for what it is: a thinly disguised attempt at political blackmail and an enormous insult to those many Australians who have campaigned so long and so hard on environmental issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not only is the Telstra&hyphen;environment link a false one, but it comprises only $277 million worth of expenditure on the environment over the next three years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That figure represents less than 5 per cent of total Coalition election promises and about 0.1 per cent of the total Federal Budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Government can find within its Budget $600 million worth of new defence spending, half a billion dollars in subsidies for the private health insurance industry, and over $2.5 billion in tax relief, why&mdash;then&mdash;is the environment being singled out for such unfair treatment?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sale of Telstra should stand or fall on its own merits. The funding for the environment should stand or fall on its own merits. One should not be used to prop up the other.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats have already outlined their reasons for opposing the sale of Telstra. We have concluded, based on international experience and research, that better consumer outcomes, better national savings outcomes and better economic outcomes can be achieved in other ways. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="799"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The more information that becomes available, the more obvious it becomes: the decision to sell Telstra is ideologically&mdash;and not economically&mdash;driven.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats do not deny the need to allocate additional funding to the environment. We have a long record of calling for a significant boost in environment funding and, after years of inaction and neglect, there are now very clear priority areas which require urgent action.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We also know that Australians are becoming increasingly aware of the need to take action to protect and preserve the environment. A major EPAC study of the spending and taxing preferences of Australians in 1994 found that the electorate at large wanted to see spending on environment programs doubled, and&mdash;most significantly&mdash;they were prepared to pay to ensure that happened.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Governments in this country&mdash;both Labor and Liberal&mdash;have a long history of taking a short&hyphen;term, short&hyphen;sighted and small&hyphen;minded approach to funding the environment. Their lack of leadership has led to the point where we now lag well behind the rest of the world in addressing our environmental problems and making our taxation system more environmentally responsible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sale of Telstra does nothing to remedy this situation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For a start, if the sale of Telstra proceeds, public sector savings will actually fall. That will leave less public sector revenues available to fund the full range of government programs, including environmental programs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over the next four years, the profits from Telstra have been forecast by BZW Australia to rise from $1.752 million last year to nearly $3 billion a year by 1998. The sale of 35 per cent of Telstra will result in a loss to the public sector of nearly $500 million a year by 1998.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is because the saving on interest payments from reducing debt&mdash;about $530 million a year&mdash;will be much less than the loss of 35 per cent of Telstra's profits&mdash;by then worth about $1 billion a year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The oft&hyphen;repeated refusal of this Government to consider its revenue options means that shortfall will have to be met from spending cuts across other programs, including the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will be on top of the cuts to environment programs the Coalition already appears to contemplate in five years under what it claim is the "biggest and best environment policy ever" .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Coalition's proposed Natural Environment Heritage Trust Fund, spending on the environment will fall from $206 million a year in 2000&hyphen;01 to just $28.8 million in 2001/2. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Just when programs start gearing up, they will face an 86 per cent cut.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That demonstrates, despite public protestations to the contrary, this Government's cynical commitment to the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(This is based on the Coalitions statements. The Natural Heritage Trust Fund Bill has not yet been drafted with Environment Minister Senator Hill describing it as "non&hyphen;essential" for this session of Parliament. This is despite the Government's insistence on the importance of the Telstra/ environment link).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The difference between the Coalition approach and the Democrat bill is clearly demonstrated by our estimate that, at the end of five years, having funded all the programs nominated by the Coalition, the Democrats' Fund would stand at about $1.1 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is three times as much money available for future programs than under the Coalition fund, which would have been run down to $360 million by 2001.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The interest from the fund would support three times as many environment programs as the interest from the Coalition fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Public sector savings would be about $700 million a year better off than if Telstra was sold, because 100 per cent of Telstra profits would be flowing to the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And Telstra would remain in full public ownership with full public accountability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In short, the Democrats seek to show through this bill that if Telstra is not sold, the public is better off, public sector savings are better off, and the environment it better off.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats believe such a vitally important area as environmental funding should come from the budget. We demonstrate with this bill that if the government is determined to link Telstra to the environment it can get a better deal for both through this model than with its own controversial proposal. Maintaining Telstra in public ownership provides such an improvement in public sector finances that seven per cent of Telstra's profits can be allocated to setting up the national heritage trust fund while still improving public sector savings.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The urgency is that the return of the writs for the election of senators in South Australia has taken place. We have some 30 days to resolve whether there is a problem with the election of one of those senators, Senator&hyphen;designate Ferris. Under the constitution she may very well be incapable of sitting as a senator in this place. As I said, 30 days from the close of the writs is the end of next week&mdash;Thursday, 30 May.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have just over a week to discuss this issue. Some may argue that this gives us a bit of time but just over a week not only for us to discuss the issue but also for people to institute proceedings, if in fact proceedings are appropriate in this case, is not long. It may well be that proceedings may have to be issued through the Court of Disputed Returns. To do that right, anyone who may feel aggrieved by the election process or the capacity for Senator&hyphen;elect Ferris to sit in this place will, I am sure, have to brief solicitors, go through the documentation and lodge those documents. That would take the best part of four or five days.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="801">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, to get it right there needs to be a return to order by the end of this week. That is why the date imposed by this motion gives us 1 pm on Thursday of this week and five, six or seven days, not including two days over the weekend, is a tight framework within which to formulate the documentation. That has to be taken into account in the context of the fact that it has already taken some 22 days to get serious answers from the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first question concerning this matter was raised on 1 May and it is now 21 May. It has been 20 days. After 20 days, in response to a number of questions from the opposition, we have had one answer from Senator Vanstone which did not go to the essence of the concern that we have, that is, whether senator&hyphen;designate Ferris either occupied a position of profit or in fact received any benefit which would accrue to such a position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If they cannot get it right in 20 days, we need to be sure that the documentation that is presented to us by Thursday is full and adequate. In fact, there may be a further need for a return to order, given the degree of dissembling by the government. I understand that it is not an easy issue for the government and that there are pressures surrounding this particular matter. I can understand that some of those pressures are forcing some of the leadership in this parliament to ensure that the 30&hyphen;day period does expire and that thereafter there is a belief that the appointment of senator&hyphen;designate Ferris may not be open to challenge, particularly in the Court of Disputed Returns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a time imperative in this matter. Senator Hill says that they are actually getting the documentation together and that they want this motion deferred until tomorrow. If he is getting the documentation together, there is no problem with letting this motion pass today, having the cut&hyphen;off day as Thursday and the government working within that time frame from today until Thursday, which is close to 45 hours, and then getting the documentation to us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot see why Senator Hill wants to defer this motion until tomorrow if in fact <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> what he says is right, that he is trying to get these documents together. There is a time imperative because there are constitutional limits and limits imposed by the Electoral Act which would force proceedings in this matter to take place within a certain period. There may be capacity to raise the matter after that, but that is another course of action altogether, and possibly one which the government by dissembling this process may be opening up in the longer term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From the opposition's perspective there are serious issues to be answered. The advice we received yesterday concerned whether in fact senator&hyphen;designate Ferris was officially appointed. That has not been the thrust of most of the questioning. The thrust of most of the questioning goes to other aspects such as a person being incapable of being chosen or sitting as a senator under section 44 of the Constitution. The documentation we are asking for here is documentation which, if provided, would satisfy the Senate one way or another about the problems senator&hyphen;designate Ferris might have.</PARA></SPEECH>

That then gives those people the opportunity of placing down, for the enlightenment of other senators, the reasons why the legislation should be  supported.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned that I believe that a number of matters should be placed on the scales when weighing up whether or not one should support the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill 1996. Last night I briefly mentioned <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="805"> that this should include the question of mandate. No doubt, the committee will receive heaps of submissions from academics and the like, but we should also receive some submissions from the public in respect of that question of mandate. That is one thing that should be put onto the scales. I do not say how much weight that should be given.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of other matters that should be put onto the scales as well, including the effect on regional employment and the question of regional service quality. What is precisely meant by the universal service obligation? The legislation talks of universal service obligations in terms of basic telephone services and pay phone services. I would like to see the committee examine the question of interactive services and the like for rural Australia. I would certainly hope&mdash;no doubt, the government has the answers to these questions&mdash;that business in rural Australia is not adversely affected by the Telstra bill. I have heard the arguments that have been advanced by the minister and others that not only is that not likely to occur but because you would be in a competitive field and there was an injection of private capital in the area, you would also get further expertise. Under those circumstances, rural Australia would not need to be worried. Why is the government worried about having this go off to a committee? I do not precisely understand the full reason for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> I might mention a few other things, if the Senate would allow me. I refer to the question of the charging on user funded assets. In the past much of Telstra's infrastructure has been paid for by users. For example, farmers and subdividers have had to pay for much of the telephone network infrastructure on their own land. The decision of the High Court in Anthony v. the Commonwealth means that ownership of infrastructure, such as telephone poles, vests in Telstra even where others have defrayed much of the cost. Persons who have paid for these assets will need to be reassured that they will not be charged a rent for the use of assets that they have contributed. It will be important for them to have it on the record that the partly privatised Telstra will not be allowed to charge them beyond main tenance and other marginal costs for the use of fixed assets that Telstra never paid for or for which they paid a part.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was discussion today following a motion to take note of an answer about the impact of the post-1997 telecommunications regime. I listened to Senator Alston's response. There is a tension between maximising the sale value of Telstra and maximising competition by ensuring free and liberal access by all telecommunications providers to Telstra's natural monopoly network. If Telstra could freeze out Optus and others, its value as an unregulated monopoly would be enormous. On the other hand, if Telstra is forced to make its network available to others at below marginal cost, it could be bled to death. Some would argue that to avoid such extremes Telstra should be floated as an operating company with ownership of the natural monopoly network retained in public ownership, just as we let different road freight companies compete on an equal footing over the public roads. That is not an option before us in this particular legislation, but such suggestions highlight the critical importance of access to natural monopoly infrastructure at prices which do not exceed marginal cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Investors in Telstra, competitors and the public need to have on record clear statements as to the nature of the post&hyphen;1997 regulatory regime for telecommunications, especially clear statements on pricing principles for access to Telstra's network. I know the government has been considering this matter carefully, and I trust it will welcome the opportunity to spell out these issues for investors and others. I believe the committee will need to look at the questions relating to prospectus and information requirements under the Corporations Law, and I know that matter was given a run around the course today or yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill contains some provisions which may override the Corporations Law in ensuring that the Commonwealth as the majority shareholder is given privileged access to information and other overriding powers. I agree with the thrust of such provisions because they protect the Commonwealth's controlling role and because Telstra is no <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="806"> ordinary company. It is a regulated public monopoly, essential for Australia's future as a modern society. Any reasonable investor should realise that his investment is more a financial investment than a controlling investment. They should be up&hyphen;front and know that precisely. I think that is probably what they will know when they read the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, it would be desirable to have on the record from the Australian Stock Exchange that there will be no problem with Stock Exchange listing rules if Telstra is floated on this basis and that Telstra shares will be acceptable for listing on overseas exchanges notwithstanding special provisions regarding information to the government and curbs on foreign investors. Whatever one's personal views on the partial sale of Telstra, it is important that potential technical issues are put beyond doubt. None of us should be happy if a bill were passed, expenses incurred for a float, and then some issue such as Stock Exchange listing rules caused difficulties. This will be the largest proposed corporate float in Australia's history. The previous largest proposed float&mdash;can honourable senators remember the previous largest proposed float?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The previous largest proposed float was in fact the NRMA float. In fact, that collapsed at a cost of $35 million because the prospectus was misleading or deceptive. Obviously the Senate will not want to see taxpayers' money wasted through lack of attention to detail with the legal requirements for such a successful float.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another matter that the committee might well turn its attention to, and that is the control of assets held in subsidiaries or joint ventures. Somebody mentioned that yesterday as well. One point which may be raised is whether Telstra can shift key assets into subsidiaries with a less than two&hyphen;thirds Commonwealth ownership&mdash;for example, through joint ventures with other corporations.</PARA>

<TALK.START>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the point that has been made by Senator Kernot. I think <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> it important for these matters to be discussed at the committee. Some would argue, of course, that if Telstra can invest to an unlimited degree in subsidiaries which may be controlled by co&hyphen;owners, public moneys may go to help private interests capture strategic beachheads in certain areas of new technology. I have no fixed view on this matter but would be interested to hear the views of those far more knowledgeable than myself. I would think that submissions to be made to the committee that we are envisaging would assist along that path.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I have had the benefit of indications from the government on some of these issues, but I think it would be desirable&mdash;and I feel sure that the government will have no objection to this&mdash;that we should have firmly documented all of these matters for all to see how some of these issues are to be handled. Investors in Telstra may need to be reminded that Telstra is still going to be a public, majority&hyphen;owned asset with historical and national commitments to provide full services across Australia. The parliament can only consent to the partial sale of Telstra on the understanding that investors will not seek and will not be able to use its unique natural monopoly position to extract monopoly tribute from the country or ignore its community service obligations to provide a nationwide service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure that the government has these views and will welcome the opportunity to place its views on these matters on the public record. I understand what Senator Alston and other members of the government have been doing, but I believe they really should not object to representatives on the committee being able to do this so as to put it clearly on the public record. If Telstra is to be partially floated, it is vital that there be an informed market and that no investor is deluded into thinking that Telstra's directors will be at large to charge what the market will bear. This is not an ordinary company&mdash;indeed, the very term `company' seems odd when talking about a publicly&hyphen;owned utility&mdash;and no investor should think that the fiduciary duties of directors to secure the best returns for one&hyphen;third minority shareholders mean that Telstra <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="807"> is released from the overriding obligation to provide a world&hyphen;class telecommunications service over the whole of Australia.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not take up much of the Senate's time, but I want to make a couple of points in relation to three words the government seems to have discovered quite recently go together and are using to an enormous extent; they are, `failure to pass'. Government members tend to use this term to me over coffee, in meetings, outside radio stations and at any opportunity whatsoever. They are obviously popular words in the government at the moment. I thought I would just mention a few things about them. They were mentioned certainly yesterday by Senator Hill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, Senator Hill seems to think that the double dissolution of 1951 is a good precedent to use for whether or not this Senate should refer the contents of this bill to a committee. The obvious problem with that is that in 1951 the Senate did not have the comprehensive committee system it has today. It is very obvious that 20 per cent to 25 per cent of all bills which come to the Senate are referred to one committee or another. We refer them to lots of different types of committees&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="FERGUSON" NAMEID="EP5">

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TW4">Senator BOURNE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, they may go to legislation committees, they may go to reference committees, they may go to joint committees and they may go to select committees. Let us have a look at a couple. Do we remember the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993? This is a classic bill. It was introduced into the House of Representatives on 17 August 1993 and into the Senate on 7 September of that year. The constitutional aspects were referred to a Senate committee on 31 August. There was an extension of time to report by 6 September. That report was tabled on 27 September.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition then referred, by another motion, the fringe benefits tax provisions to a different committee on 6 September. There was an extension of time to report by 27 September. The report was tabled on 19 October. It was split into separate bills, all of which were then referred by the opposition, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> through the Selection of Bills Committee, to various different committees and they were then passed with amendments in late October 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then, of course, there is the classic that we are all mentioning at the moment: the land fund bill 1994. That was introduced into the House of Representatives on 30 June 1994 and into the Senate on 21 September 1994 and was referred by the Selection of Bills Committee to the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration on 1 September. That report was tabled on 10 October. Senate amendments were referred by an opposition motion during the committee stage of that bill, on the floor of the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can relate this back to something Senator Kernot has been quoted as saying. While that committee stage of that bill was going on, Senator Campbell moved an opposition motion to refer that bill to the Select Committee on the Land Fund Bill on 28 November. It was referred, the extension of time was given to them on 31 January and the report was finally tabled on 9 February. The House of Representatives agreed to certain amendments, disagreed to the remainder and laid aside the bill on 2 March and another bill was introduced after that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Kernot has actually been quoted in relation to the land fund bill as saying that two weeks was sufficient time for it to be sent out to a select committee for examination. I point out that that was the second time this bill had gone to a committee. That was the second committee it had gone to, not the first. We had been through the second reading of the bill. We had been through a referral to a committee. It had gone to a committee. The committee had reported. We had gone through some of the committee stage. We were in the middle of the committee stage on the floor of this parliament when the opposition rose to its feet and referred it to another committee. At that point, Senator Kernot said, not unreasonably, `I think two weeks more is probably enough.' And it probably was. We got it back then&mdash;it was five months overall, I might add&mdash;five months after it was first introduced and it was finally laid aside and a new bill <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="808"> came in. We all know what happened to that bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure Senator Hill did not deliberately misrepresent Senator Kernot, just as I am sure Senator Alston did not deliberately misrepresent me during question time today. I was talking about the Telstra bill on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The World Today</EMPHASIS>, which is quite a popular program. I am quite surprised he could not remember the name of it. In answer to the question, `But will you vote for a privatisation of Telstra under some circumstance?', I said, `No. Absolutely not.' I did say that. Then I went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But that's not all that's in that Bill. This Bill doesn't just say `privatising Telstra'. This bill says privatising Telstra and getting rid of the Minister's power to direct Telstra and consumer protection and customer guarantee.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the point. When Senator Hill says that because we are not prepared to vote for the privatisation of Telstra we should not be prepared to look at this bill, that is well and truly against the spirit of this Senate. Of course we should be prepared to look at this bill. Privatising Telstra is only one part of this bill; it is about half the bill. The other half of the bill looks at consumer guarantees&mdash;very important things which should be looked at, despite the fact that they are already in the Telecommunications Act at sections 287 and 288. They should still be looked at to see if they can be strengthened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If it came to a joint sitting of both houses, the only amendments that could be made to a bill put to a joint sitting are ones which have been considered by one house of the parliament. You have to look at these measures. It is vitally important that they are looked at, looked at thoroughly and looked through. So we look through consumer protection and customer guarantees. It is very important that that happens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The best way to do that is not what happened in the House of Representatives only last week. This bill was gagged through with virtually no debate&mdash;but that is the House of Representatives. This should now have public and parliamentary scrutiny. I thought this government when it was in opposition was in favour of public and parliamentary scrutiny, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> particularly by the Senate. I thought that is what it was in favour of. I could be wrong. I hope I am not. I will certainly be voting in favour of public and parliamentary scrutiny of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is due process. It is exactly what the Senate does with bills. This is what the Senate does with 20 per cent to 25 per cent of all bills that come before it: it refers them to a committee. It refers them to legislative, reference, joint or select committees. The bills go off to different committees and they come back in various periods of time. Senator Margetts told us yesterday that the average time taken is about three months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are to refer it to a committee within this sitting session, we have to keep in mind we have only 3&half; sitting weeks left. That is totally inadequate for a bill of this complexity and importance. It is vitally important that before the Senate looks at whether Telstra should be privatised we see what is going to happen in those 1997 reviews. People from merchant banks are saying to me, `We cannot decide on how we should advise our clients until we know what is going happen in the 1997 review of deregulation.' That is vitally important. That is one of the things that will be looked at in this committee reference, and that is why I will be voting for it.</PARA></SPEECH>

It is just a shame he was not at that industry forum that I chaired last Thursday when we had almost 200 people from the industry all very interested in the issues. As far as I am concerned, we are going to establish an experts group to work through what came out of that gathering. I have no doubt that it will be very useful in the debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would have been open for this chamber to have established a select committee on the post&hyphen;1997 environment just as this Senate, as I understand it, has already voted to re-establish the select committee on community standards. Why would you not want to consider those matters in isolation from the bill? They are only linked to this bill as a very shabby means of disguising the Labor Party's and the Democrats' predetermined position, to give some sort of shabby facade of respectability to what is clearly a desperate attempt to drag this process out as long as possible because they do not have the courage to give effect to the decision they have already made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I made it clear yesterday that I thought Senator Faulkner made a fundamental tactical mistake by signalling the Labor Party's determination to oppose the bill before it had even been introduced into this chamber. That is what Senator Bourne ought to be reflecting on when it comes to considerations of failure to pass. The courts have always looked at the surrounding circumstances. They do not simply ask: is it reasonable to refer a bill to a committee? They look at whether that is a bona fide action or whether it is simply a mechanism for delaying a government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Faulkner was on his feet the moment question time finished with a furious defence of Mr Gareth Evans, a former erstwhile leader in this chamber. He seemed to be saying that Mr Gareth Evans was still a man of great virtue. He was still stating the honourable path that ought to be followed, that they were prepared to examine matters on the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> merits and all of that. Senator Kemp has brought to my attention&mdash;and I find this fascinating&mdash;what former Senator Gareth Evans said when the then Labor Party in opposition, had the numbers in this place. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . since 1 July this year the practical preconditions for the exercise of these powers have once again been created, with the Government's loss of control of the Senate. Until now the new Senate has exercised its power in a cautious and principled way, with neither the Australian Labor Party nor the Australian Democrats being willing to block in any way the passage of those money Bills crucial to the survival of any government in office, or to interfere with those measures for which the Government could reasonably claim a mandate.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say at a later date, on 26 November:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will not vote against any Government Bill which is crucial to the Government's survival in office, and in particular the Supply and Appropriation Bills come into that description, nor will we vote against any Government Bill, whatever its character and however obnoxious we find it to be, if the Government has a clear-cut electoral mandate for the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA>What could be more crystal clear than the government's mandate in respect of the Telstra bill? If you walked into polling booths around Australia on 2 March, what you would have found were warning signs telling you, presumably in shorthand, of all the horrible things that would flow from the coalition parties being elected to government because they would decimate and destroy Telstra as we know it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If ever there was an issue central to the campaign, if ever there was an issue upon which the public had its say and gave us a resounding tick, it was Telstra. I have not heard one word of criticism in relation to this bill that it does not faithfully reflect the promises we made during the election campaign. What is there about this bill that needs to be further explored in the Senate committee?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you were fair dinkum, you may well want to have a separate inquiry into issues like the extent to which Telstra and telecommunications carriers should be excluded from state and local government regulations&mdash;that is an issue about overhead cabling and what <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="810"> should happen from 1 July next year&mdash;or issues like whether you should continue to have a telecommunications national code or a land access code or whether you should simply vacate the field and leave it to local governments and state governments. Those issues have absolutely nothing to do with a bill that simply enables the government to sell a portion of Telstra. We cannot sell beyond one-third. That is what this law would require.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A scoping study is already under way. Investors are not concerned about having a Senate inquiry. What they want is due diligence carried out. They will make their judgments on hardnosed predictions about the future and the current regulatory environment. They all understand, without exception, that community service obligations ought to be imposed in any environment, whether you have a single monopoly, whether you have a cosy duopoly or whether you have ferocious competition. We will have been through each of those phases within a decade, irrespective of the passage of this bill. I regret to say that we are many years off the pace, and we are falling further behind in terms of competitive arrangements and therefore lower prices and better quality of service, but the fact is that all of these things are happening anyway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No carrier has ever argued that it should not be subject to requirements for community service obligations. None of them has ever said to me, `It's about time you got rid of untimed local calls.' None of them has said, `Scrap the price cap regime.' None of them has said that the universal service levy scheme is not appropriate in a fully competitive environment. In other words, ever since 1991 Telstra has been required to operate commercially and it wears the community service obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whether or not this bill passes, if you have apprehensions that somehow they will use the wording in section 288&mdash;which Senator Bourne seemed to think was relevant&mdash;they can do that right now. There is nothing to stop them walking away from their obligations, watering them down and seeking to evade them. All of that can happen utterly unrelated to the privatisation of Telstra. That is why this ought to be seen for what it is.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have no objection to a Senate committee bona fide investigating on the merits, and Senator Harradine is perfectly correct to say that that is what parliamentary committees are for. Indeed, he is quite right in saying also that that is the purpose of legislation committees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think Senator Ferguson made it perfectly plain earlier this afternoon, that the whole purpose of a legislation committee is to have legislation referred to it. Once you diverge from that principle, you are clearly conceding that you have ulterior motives. The motives here, of course, are transparent. The opposition wants the numbers. It wants to have the ability to come back on 20 August and say, `Oh, well, we're only about a quarter of the way through this huge round-the-world excursion into absolutely every issue we can throw into a grab bag of issues. We need a lot longer than three months, thank you very much. Because we have the numbers on that committee and because, with the support of our close friends the Democrats, we can get the numbers in the chamber, we will simply go on avoiding the evil day for as long as possible.'</PARA>

They will be seen for what they are: people who are opposed to change; people who do not have any coherent view of what is in the national interest; people who are highly selective in their support of privatisation. They know what is happening internationally. They know that every dominant carrier in the top 20 by revenue around the world has already been privatised or is about to be. They know that no country has introduced competition without also privatising the dominant carrier. It has happened everywhere else; it will happen here. It is simply a matter of time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What you want is to handicap Telstra for as long as possible, condemn it to a second-rate existence and keep one hand behind its back so that it becomes increasingly uncompetitive. That, I think, is not only a great shame but a disgrace in the context of a bill which is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="811"> simply designed to enable privatisation to commence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, as Senator Harradine would have it, it is perfectly respectable to send a bill off to a committee. But, given that there has been very little community concern expressed to date, apart from a few vested interests, I would have thought the sensible course to follow would be to have referred it off to the legislation committee, initially for a four-week period&mdash;which is what we have in mind in our amendment&mdash;and you then see what comes in. If I am wrong and you are swamped by a whole range of concerns, then you may take the view that you need to come back to the chamber and ask for an extension. It would be difficult in those circumstances to justify the need to just ram the bill through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not what is happening here. Irrespective of any level of community concerns, despite the fact that they have already made up their minds, they are now trying to put in place a regime that would justify not just a three-month extension but virtually an endless extension. If you seriously wanted to address all of these issues, many of which are utterly extraneous to the purpose of this bill, to do justice to those would take you a couple of years. You simply could not begin to assess the impact of privatisation on employment and economic activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The amendments do not even say `privatisation of Telstra'. They say, `the impact of the duplication of infrastructure and the extent to which this can be reduced by sharing.' That has been a hot debate for some months, probably several years. It could well have been looked at by a select committee. There is not the slightest interest in the subject. No-one on the other side has been jumping up asking questions about these issues or saying that these matters ought to be investigated as a matter of high priority. As I say, we have re-established the community standards select committee. Why couldn't we have established select committees on these issues? They have nothing to do with privatisation. Important though they are, they will operate totally unrelated to the privatisation proposal, just as the post-1997 regime to which you are com mitted&mdash;I am sorry you were not there last Thursday&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by saying, again on Senator Harradine's point, that if you impose an obligation on Telstra to charge below marginal cost pricing principles, then it would effectively bleed to death. That is not how the universal service levy works. There is an avoidable cost methodology which is designed to fully compensate them for any losses and that is then recouped by a levy on the other carriers. That is regarded on all sides as a fair concept. As I have said many times, it is borrowed directly from the US, where they have never had publicly owned telecommunications companies. It services rural and remote areas just as effectively as it does here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you had concerns about that or in some other way you wanted to boost that obligation, you could do it via a select committee because, if it is an issue now, it will remain an issue irrespective of whether this bill goes through. It will be an issue in the post&hyphen;1997 environment. The fact that you have tagged all these things on simply exposes you for what you are: obstructionist.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier in this debate I asked the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Family Services, Senator Woods, a couple of questions. I would like to go over one of them. It related to the fact that, for the last few years, the TGA has adopted the practice of formally notifying both the minister and the secretary to the department whenever it receives a request for the special use of a drug as an abortifacient. Can the parliamentary secretary confirm that that is the case? If it is, could he tell me how many requests have been received?</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I am informed, since 1991, which is when the therapeutic goods legislation came into effect, there have been two approvals for RU486 under the CTN procedure. For the CTX procedure there were no clinical trial approvals. There were a number of approvals for RU486 for non&hyphen;abortion related issues, such as various cancers or Cushings syndrome. Since February 1991, under the CTN there has been a total of six notifications of abortion drugs, including RU486.</PARA></SPEECH>

One of the key motivating factors for the review was not from the pharmaceutical end of the spectrum but rather from the natural foods and herbal products end of the spectrum. With some justification, there is a concern that perhaps unnecessary bureaucratic barriers have been erected to some of those products. That is one of the issues of the review. The time frame has not been settled, but we would certainly like to do this as soon as possible. I have instructed the department to look at ways in which we can do it quickly and get representations from a whole range of groups.

You have said it applies only at the time the application for importation is made. Therefore, can I conclude that if the medication were already in the country and if it were then used as an abortifacient, under this piece of legislation it would not be a problem?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, you could not assume that. It is perfectly clear in the amendment. The amendment states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In spite of any other provision of this Act, a person must not, without the written approval of the Minister, import any restricted goods into Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, there needs to be an application for those restricted goods, namely, abortifacients, which include progesterone antagonists and vaccines against HCG intended for use in women as abortifacients. The procedure would be for a person who desires to import such drugs to apply. That is what happens now: they apply to the department. A delegate in the department makes the decision. All this does is require that that decision be made by the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the current circumstances, because these are prohibited imports&mdash;because they are abortifacients&mdash;there is clearly a decision to be made on the basis of the application. That does not mean that a person can import this particular abortion drug and then use it for purposes other than those for which the application was approved. Other procedures would then be able to be adopted which would ensure that that did not take place. The amendment states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . written approval may be given:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) unconditionally or subject to conditions; or</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) in respect of particular restricted goods or classes of restricted goods.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps I will clarify this situation. Probably one of the problems has been your description of progesterone antagonists, the category you asked me about. There are other drugs which have been approved for other purposes in Australia, in particular one or two drugs which are effective anti&hyphen;ulcer drugs which also claim to have some effect in terms of being an abortion drug.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that situation, I think it is fair to say that they have been approved for certain purposes&mdash;namely, their anti&hyphen;ulcer properties&mdash;not for their abortion properties. Therefore, using them in that situation is not covered by Senator Harradine's amendment. It is still an unapproved usage of that drug. The only situation I can think of where that might be relevant is that if those drugs were in the country it might be possible for people to use their presence, if you like, in the country as part of a trial and then undergo a CTX or CTN notification of a chemical trial. That is outside the importation, which Senator Harradine's amendment is really focusing on.</PARA></SPEECH>

That is something which we could debate at some length. It is not a major concern to us. In terms of the AMA's apparent perception that we are in some way banning a drug from coming to Australia, that is not the case.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to go back one step to the concern which has been raised by Senator Crowley and has been partially answered, I believe, by Senator Harradine. I wanted to get a comment, if I could, from both the parliamentary secretary and Senator Harradine on a very disturbing article that was in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>  newspaper dated today, Tuesday 21 May 1996. The article in part reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">WA doctors warned yesterday that attempts by a senator to restrict the use of the abortion drug RU486 would rob them of an important tool used to treat breast, lung and brain cancer.</PARA>
<PARA>I will continue reading, because I think it is important for the context to be given. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">King Edward Memorial Hospital chief executive Gareth Goodier said the drug company which manufactured RU486 had warned it would withdraw the drug completely from the Australian market if Tasmanian independent Brian Harradine's restrictions were passed by Federal Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA>I find that a very disturbing article, for several reasons. One is that I think we should have an assurance from the minister that there is no question that an unintended consequence of this amendment could be that people who require this drug for treatment for other conditions&mdash;ones that have nothing to do with this amendment&mdash;will be disadvantaged and penalised in that way. I am also deeply perturbed that a drug company is using a threat of this kind against the Australian population, basically, and against the Australian Senate by saying that it wants to withdraw totally its activities in the country, even for beneficial purposes that are in no way related to this amendment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to answer Senator Chamarette's question. I was slightly irate when I saw the article and had a previous communication. I thought it was from a Dr Goody rather than from Dr Goodier, but perhaps I am mistaken in that regard. I will come to the substance of what you are raising, but let me first of all point out to honourable senators that RU486 is not a valuable drug in terms of treating any of the cancers which are listed. I simply point out that, if it was so, why has it only been used on 10 patients, or some number of that order? If it is such a wonderful drug and if you would really be depriving patients of a valuable drug, why is it not more widely used? This is clearly something which has been dragged in to bolster an argument; but that is a separate issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Hypothetically, if it were a good drug, would there be any question of us trying to restrict its use in, say, meningioma&mdash;which is one of the potential uses of the drug? The answer is very clearly no. We have legal opinion to the effect that it would in fact be the case that the amendment moved by Senator Harradine would not restrict its access for those sorts of purposes. The amendment clearly states that it is the purpose of abortifacient uses that would be constrained by the legislation. As Senator Harradine has said, and I would reinforce it, certainly the last thing that either of us would want to do would be in any way to deprive patients of access to a drug which was beneficial in the treatment of cancer or, indeed, of any other serious illness.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="819">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me just say that RU486 is not on the market, so we are not depriving patients of a drug which is on the market. And it is not a drug which, as I understand it, is likely to come onto the market, according to the manufacturers&mdash;who, I believe, are Rhonpoulenc. We are not actually affecting a drug which is readily available on the market. It is imported in various situations, as far as I am aware, for a couple of clinical trials and for a handful of other indications.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have at least one further question, and it is to Senator Harradine. I am concerned about the wording of paragraphs (4) and (5) of your second amendment, which refers to the importation of restricted goods. They read:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) A written approval shall be laid before each House of the Parliament . . . within 5 sitting days of being given.</PARA>

<PARA>Is there any particular reason that we are being asked to support in this amendment the tabling and notification of an approval but we are not being asked for the notification or tabling of a rejection?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I raise this as it is a similar concern for other people. I am deciding my position on the amendment during this committee debate and on the basis of the answers I receive. I know that I do not hold the balance of power and that the issue may well already have been decided by other party positions. I wish that everyone here did have a conscience vote on this matter, because I think that that would give the people who are concerned about the passage of this amendment a greater degree of confidence in the determination of the Senate. I am sorry to digress a little bit, but that is the context in which I ask this question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that the appropriate accountability mechanism for an issue which has political and social components needs to be open and transparent. So I am slightly in favour of supporting the amendment, believing that it is the minister who should be accountable. I also think that notification would allow for a parliamentary debate without allowing a parliamentary veto, which could well be influenced by party political pressure and block voting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am concerned that this motion only half allows that debate to occur. Those people who are concerned about a rejection by the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="820"> minister for approval for trials feel that that decision will not be given the same level of scrutiny and accountability through ministerial process to which it is entitled. Is there any proposal to allow both approval and rejection decisions to be subjected to the notification process?</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(5.39 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Chamarette has said that tabling of the decision in the parliament is not a trigger for a disallowance. That was in my original motion. I thank Senator Chamarette for expressing concern about that. It is fair to say that the government and the opposition were concerned about that for a number of reasons. As a result of the reasons being advanced to me, I dropped those parts of this amendment relating to them and did not move them. This measure requires the tabling of the decision in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Chamarette has asked, for example: if the minister is to table a decision to exempt RU486 from being a prohibited import, why should there not be a tabling of a decision which does not exempt? The measure that I am proposing arose out of a situation where a delegate in the department of health provided an exemption and told no-one, except the applicant. The decision was leaked by concerned people, people who were very much associated with the organisation which was the sponsor, who then provided the information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That information was given to us for the estimates committee. It was asked of the Therapeutics Goods Administration: why did that decision take place when there was an undertaking, publicly given, for decisions of this nature to involve the minister?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Questions were further asked about the CTN, the clinical trial scheme, that has resulted. The Therapeutic Goods Administration has said that it was simply acting as a post box. If an application were made for a clinical trial&mdash;and that included a statement by an institutional ethics committee, whether it be a compliant institutional ethics committee or otherwise&mdash;and there was a payment of $110, then that was the end of it. The Therapeutics Goods Administration had nothing else to do with it.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was only because the decision of the delegate who approved the importation of that prohibited import was leaked by somebody within the system that the public found out about the matter; otherwise, the public would not have known about it. You may recall that the trial consent forms which were to be signed by women subjects of the trial were found to be inadequate and not to have contained vital information. As a result, the trial was stopped for a while.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now we have got to the stage, hopefully, where the minister will assume ministerial responsibility and where the delegate in the department will not be required to take responsibility. We have gone one step further to say that the decision should be tabled in the parliament. The other side of the coin, relating to the decision not to approve, is not included. The reason, I suggest, is that the applicant would make absolutely sure that the matter was raised publicly. You can be absolutely sure of that. It would be in the interests of the applicant who was refused permission to raise it publicly. I have no doubt that that would occur both inside and outside parliament.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Harradine for his exposition of the rationale of this amendment. Amendment No. 3, at 23AA(2), states that `A written approval shall be laid before each House of the Parliament by the Minister within 5 sitting days of being given'. I ask the minister whether changing the amendment to read `The Minister's decision shall be laid' would actually complicate matters or improve matters so they are more fair to all parties. I would not mind hearing Senator Crowley's view. She is one of the people who have expressed concern about this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am concerned that some of the objections to this amendment have simply been to prevent a public debate and to actually suppress a dissenting voice. It may or may not be a voice I agree with. I believe that the public has a right to know the arguments that lie behind the importation of all therapeutic goods. There may be other categories that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="821"> deserve more public scrutiny than they currently get.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am concerned that the parliament has done a Pontius Pilate in relation to the Therapeutic Goods Act. I have been trying to search for the reasons why Peter Baume raised the whole issue of distancing and putting at arms length these particular kinds of decisions from the minister. I actually think that, while there may be good aspects to that, there are also negative aspects to that. We deserve to have parliamentary scrutiny of decisions. We deserve to have a voice on issues and not simply leave them to boards of experts. That can result in the same kinds of political pressures and pressures from pharmaceutical companies that people are complaining would prevent us from adequately debating or deciding on that issue. There is a problem there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the reason why I come into this debate at the point where I cannot say there is a clear&hyphen;cut yes or no. If I support the amendment, it does not show that I think it is a clumsy instrument and it singles out one particular type of drug. There is no doubt about it; it is imperfect. However, if I do not support it, I am agreeing to a principle which I also believe is flawed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we were considering the importation of plutonium into this country, we would not leave it to an expert committee or an ethics committee; we would demand that this parliament had a say. I am keen that we see the processes of scrutiny and public consultation not undermined by distancing it. If this amendment can be improved in such a way that it allows a genuine public debate on an issue without putting undue pressure on the minister, but allows that kind of explanation to be given for reasons for a decision, it could be a beneficial amendment and it could warrant the support that I think it will probably get in this chamber.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not feel strongly about the argument that Senator Chamarette has put forward. Senator Harradine's arguments are very valid. We are essentially talking about how we increase the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> public scrutiny of an important issue and the public accountability of an important issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point that Senator Harradine made is that it is possible on the one side to allow scrutiny to take place with natural process. For example, if a particular organisation or manufacturer wanted to set up a clinical trial or a particular evaluation or a usage of a drug and that were turned down, it is pretty inconceivable that that would not be made public pretty quickly. Therefore, the suggestion which Senator Chamarette is making is probably superfluous in as much as that side of the fence will always be open to public scrutiny and accountability and, no doubt, public debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not quite sure why I am defending Senator Harradine; he is quite capable of defending himself. Senator Harradine is trying to say, `Let's balance it up and make sure that the scrutiny is available, whatever the decision might be, and that the tabling and the actual formal statement about the decision is actually allowed, which in the past has had the potential to go through unnoticed until a late stage in the process.' Although I do not feel strongly about it, I am not sure that there is a necessity for it.

<TIME.STAMP>(5.50 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a point that has been of concern to me. If we are going to require under this amendment that the minister's decision to approve be in writing and therefore come into this place and be noted and open to public scrutiny, it seems to me to be quite surprising that we do not also require the minister's decision not to approve to come into this place and be open to scrutiny. I find it amazing that Senator Harradine is saying, `I'm quite sure the vested interests which are making application would make public that they have not been allowed to proceed.' There may be many times when they would not. You could not rely on that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That line might haunt you, Senator Harradine, compared to your consistency in terms of openness and accountability in other debates. You would not have wanted that same kind of `Oh, well, you can expect that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="822"> they will take it up' to be sufficient to account for the people, for example, who might have wanted to oppose the clinical trials. It seems to me a bit unusual for you to allow that there is sure to be information in the public arena from, presumably, a pharmaceutical company that is given a rejection slip by the minister and that there is no need for that rejection slip to be made public in here. For the purposes of consistency, I would have thought Senator Harradine would find no trouble at all in allowing an amendment to his amendment that makes it the minister's decision and not approval. In the end, what is decided in this place will, no doubt, see the passage of this amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point that Senator Chamarette has raised&mdash;I appreciate her recalling it for me&mdash;is a very important point. If we are to go this way on the ground of public accountability and on the ground that the public should have access to information so that the community, being thoroughly informed, can then, on the evidence tabled in this parliament, discuss it further, proceed to another debate or whatever, it seems to me surprising that we should allow only 50 per cent of that information to come.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think there is a de facto assumption, Senator Harradine, that you are presuming that, by and large, the minister will be giving approval, but there should not be any room for legislation to depend on that kind of assumption. If you want to argue openness, transparency and the rights of people to know, you cannot possibly say, `But just some of the information.' For consistency, Senator Harradine, you more than most should be saying, `You're quite right. It's an oversight. I agree, we should allow the minister's rejection to be as open to tabling and gazetting in this place as the minister's approval.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Harradine, I am shocked at your inconsistency on this point. You have a reputation for demanding transparency, for very often making your argument based on the right of people to know. I would argue with you about the focus of what they are entitled to know, but I am amazed that you would not accept the very reasonable proposition of Senator Chamarette. At least you <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> could accept an amendment to your amendment to allow full transparency and the opportunity for any rejection of approval by the minister or denial of approval by the minister to be equally open to gazettal and tabling and possible discussion in this place.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in the third reading debate on this bill because of the anguish that I went through in making my decision in relation to the amendment put forward by Senator Harradine. I would like to put on the public record the position that the Greens (WA) have taken on these amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My colleague Senator Margetts indicated earlier in the second reading debate on this therapeutic goods bill that she already had a position&mdash;and that was a position that had the majority support within the Greens (WA), particularly amongst women's groups and people who felt that there was some difficulty with the amendments that were being proposed&mdash;but that she was not pre-empting my decision on that matter. As a consequence, I have been maintaining very close contact with this debate in order to actually determine what I would feel comfortable with at the end of it. In a way, because the issue is resolved, I seek the indulgence of my colleagues here to present that explanation. It was one that I did not mention in the second reading debate for obvious reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The issue that we have been discussing may appear clear-cut to some people in one way or another. I believe that it is not a clear- <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="823">cut issue at all, and I think that the kinds of questions that were raised at the committee stage and that have been canvassed during the debate have been very important and appropriate. They basically go to the core of two issues, one of which is one of the most prominent social issues of our time. That issue concerns both personal liberties in relation to the unborn and the role of the state in relation to the individual.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is my position, and it is also the position of the Greens (WA), that each decision concerning the termination of pregnancy is ultimately the right and responsibility of the individual woman concerned. That position is one, I believe, that people have felt was in jeopardy through some of the matters under consideration here. However, that decision is made in a social context which in this particular aspect&mdash;namely the availability of a drug which may be used to procure abortions&mdash;has at least two dimensions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, there is the dimension of the responsibility to ensure the safety and health of users of the drug. That responsibility is discharged primarily by a committee of experts, as for any drug. I add that there has been a deal of debate on the issue of safety and the usage of that drug, not only in this country but internationally. It is quite difficult for lay people to access the kind of expert decision making bodies that may be dealing with that information if there is no public avenue for discussion of it. Secondly, there is the responsibility of the state with respect to the services available in our society by way of birth control generally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not merely a matter of personal choice in which governments bear no responsibility other than to make that choice as broad as possible. For example, the way in which governments allocate resources between education on sexuality compared with abortion services will, to a large extent, determine personal choice. It is also true that the level of personal choice that is available is determined by the access to information, and to public information, on the topics involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because there is no consensus in the community about the availability of this drug, the opinion of experts on its physiological effects <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> should not constitute the last word on whether it is made widely available. There is not only a health issue in the narrow sense&mdash;that is, whether the drug is safe&mdash;but also a question of whether the availability should be limited for ethical or policy reasons in the context of social policy. This debate is yet to be heard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The states, which have responsibility for laws on surgical abortions, have largely swept the issue under the carpet. The laws against procuring abortions remain on the statute books but they are not enforced, while thousands of abortions are carried out each year primarily, it would sometimes appear, as a means of birth control.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ultimately, our society may decide that it wishes abortion to be readily available on demand. My point is that the decision should be made openly and after taking into account community opinion. Senator Harradine's amendments address the need with respect to chemically induced abortions where community opinions may be directed and taken into account. The allocation of direct responsibility to the minister other than the usual committee no doubt constitutes a very imperfect system given the polarised positions of some community groups. It is nevertheless a mechanism which has been supported by this chamber and I believe deserves scrutiny. It deserves a watching brief on any unintended consequences which may occur to the detriment of the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe the question we have been looking at here is not the question for or against RU486. This question is really about who should have a say, who should have a voice and who should make the decision. While I was not prepared to at the end of the day support a mechanism which was imperfect, I nonetheless affirm the right of this parliament to have scrutiny over such issues. The position is basically taken from a point of view of: `Do we delegate our responsibility in a Pontius Pilate fashion to experts? Do we look at it in terms of a majority view or a consensus view or take a check and balance approach?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe the approach that has been taken is a check and balance one. I think it does bear grave responsibility on this parliament to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="824"> ensure that the dire predictions that have been made and which have really caused a great deal of anxiety and concern within the community of women across Australia&mdash;that their own rights would be violated by this parliament&mdash;are taken into great consideration in evaluating the effects of the decision to which this parliament has come today.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If it is a matter of such importance, Senator Alston, I am glad you are listening instead of interjecting across the chamber. For the record, 500,000 women <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> die each year as a consequence of childbirth and related causes. That seems to me a matter of the greatest concern. A number of those deaths are due to unsafe abortion. This is a matter of the greatest gravity. The letter continues:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The facts are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Globally, fifty million induced abortions are estimated to take place each year;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> About half of these are euphemistically called "unsafe";</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> they are often a major health hazard.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The WHO has calculated that 500 women die each day from unsafe abortion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In addition, millions are left with disease and injury.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Research suggests that for every one death, there may be up to 100 women infected or otherwise damaged as a result of unsafe abortion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over the past 20 years, improvements in family planning services, and the resulting rises in the numbers of women using contraception, have been mirrored by falls in maternal mortality and hospitalization for unsafe abortion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In recognising that there is no perfect method of contraception, Family Planning Associations also recognise that some of their clients face unwanted pregnancies and the issue of abortion therefore has to be addressed. IPPF and Family Planning Associations see it as their responsibility to persuade governments and opinion leaders of the tragic consequences and costs of not removing the barriers which prevent women accessing safe abortion. Within this context, what individual Family Planning Associations are able to do is constrained by local laws and lack of resources. Where abortion is illegal, many FPAs carry out advocacy work and undertake research on the problem to back their advocacy services. Across the globe, discussions are held with influential people, religious and community leaders and policy makers. Some FPAs offer services for the management of post&hyphen;abortion complications, or provide post&hyphen;abortion counselling and contraceptive services. Where abortion is legal, some FPAs provide safe abortion services.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">None of the above translates by any stretch of the imagination into a proactive campaign of promotion of the concept of using abortions as birth control in the third world countries. Such a statement is a blatant misrepresentation of the truth and underestimation and dismissal of the problem of unwanted pregnancies. And Family Planning Australia, on behalf of IPPF, demands an apology from Senator Harradine.</PARA>

<PARA>I read that for the record because I think it is a very powerful point. I certainly was appalled by what Senator Harradine had to say by way of a broad smear of anyone who seemed to have a different view from his during his few moments of heated rhetoric in his contribution to the debate. I do not think it helped at all, Senator Harradine, nor do such references as `under the protection of the seemingly neutral World Health Organisation'. I think I am quoting you accurately. I understand they were the sentiments I heard but if that is to misrepresent you, Senator Harradine, I apologise in anticipation, but I do not think I do you an injustice with that reference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What amazes me is that it takes a very important concern about the health of women for it to be raised in this chamber and very often by women. It certainly is a matter of concern that we have a lot of publicity and great concern about the deaths of people around the country from AIDS. I certainly am one of those who grieve and am very unhappy and sorry for  people who suffer the consequences of AIDS. One has to feel the same grief and concern about those 500,000 women who die each year, but there has been nothing like the same passion or concern for those women, nor the 14 million, now reduced to about 11 million, children who die each year from easily preventable diseases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that, on the best authority I have, none of those pregnancies are immaculate conceptions. I made the point in a slightly different way last time that men are involved in every one of those pregnancies. Yet what often happens is that women are left with very limited resources and very limited access to adequate contraception, let alone health education or preventive measures, and very often have to resort to abortion. Very often it leads to illegal abortion. Very often it leads to terrible consequences for those women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that the matters of population control&mdash;of better understanding the grief, the morbidity, the pain and the anguish and suffering of these women, their children and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> their families&mdash;should be something that challenge this Senate instead of point scoring about whether or not abortion is being promoted. As I say, in reading this letter, that is a misrepresentation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I think we do need to look around the world and start being more fair in the allocation of our dollars, our health resources, our preventative programs and our education programs so that women's health equates to men's health and access to those services and we should be addressing any insufficiencies in either men's health or women's health. But the fact that 500,000 women can go on dying each year from largely neglect in the Third World is a matter of disgrace. It is time we took very seriously our concerns to assist those women toward better help so that they have choices other than abortion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at the Cairo conference about world population, if you look at the Stockholm conference about social policy, if you look at the Beijing conference&mdash;three terribly significant conferences in the last 12 or 18 months&mdash;you will see that all of them highlight one extraordinary factor; that is, where women have access to education, where women are literate, where women have some control and responsibility over their own lives, then you see much less need for the termination of pregnancies&mdash;for abortion&mdash;and less morbidity or mortality. I raised this point on behalf of this nation when I reported on the International Year of the Family at the United Nations. We need to be giving the resources, the funds, the information and the backup to women so that they can make healthier and saner decisions, not sitting in judgment in the way that Senator Harradine has done.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just let me deal with Senator Crowley's last statement. She has come in here in high dudgeon. She has just said something which I think we should focus our attention on because what we want here are the facts. No senator can suggest that on any issue, including this one, I have taken any other approach than a rigorous analysis of the facts and then applying those facts to the values that are held by people of goodwill <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="826"> from all backgrounds to make a policy decision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On this occasion I have taken the trouble to examine this matter thoroughly. I do not intend, in any shape or form, to respond to a suggestion that I should apologise to the International Planned Parenthood Federation. I do not intend to take the time of the Senate right here and now. But there will be an occasion for me, since you have invited me to and since the Family Planning Association has raised this subject, to set it down in detail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The IPPF has its hands out for funds. The IPPF is saying that there are 500,000 maternal deaths each year. The implication of what you said was that the majority of those are from illegal abortions or botched abortions presumably.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You read what you said. That is precisely the tack that is taken by IPPF in order to get more money and in order to require governments of Third World countries to implement abortion laws so that there is abortion on demand. That is what the IPPF is doing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Crowley, you finish off by making the statement&mdash;which was, I believe, a very strange statement&mdash;that there should be more money spent on sex education. You say that if more money were spent on sex education, there would not be so many abortions. Have a look at the countries that have most abortions per capita. They are the very countries, might I suggest, where there is widespread sex education. Just analyse it. Take the United States of America as one example of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now let's hear from the people. As I said, since you have invited me, I will be very happy to deal with the International Planned Parenthood Federation. Had I had notice, I would have had the information and details here. But, since you have invited me, I will be happy to take the time of the Senate on another day on that matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me deal with this question of maternal mortality&mdash;something that is a tragic fact of life, unfortunately, in this world. I will not use my own words; I will use the words of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people who may not share my views on abortion and of some people who are well known international women's health activists. I will quote from a statement made by Sumati Nair, an international women's activist, referring to the International Planned Parenthood Federation, IPPF, and WHO. Might I just say that WHO is acting as the executing agency of the HRP, the human reproduction program, which is promoting RU486. That program is funded by World Bank, UNFPA, UNDP and certain other organisations. The quote reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sumati Nair says International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) and WHO have approved and recommended drugs such as Norplant for use in family planning programs while admitting that not enough is known about their long-term effects. Nair says private population control agencies sponsor contraceptive research and select their own scientists, institutes and private agencies to do the studies, thus controlling the research and being able to suppress negative findings.</PARA>
<PARA>The appalling tragedy of maternal mortality is often cited by those who are seeking more funds for themselves, for example, the International Planned Parenthood Federation.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But Nair and her colleagues say that this argument is used to justify trials of inadequately researched hormonal contraceptives on third world women. "The major causes for the deaths of women are evidently not childbirth and related causes, but respiratory diseases and other parasitic infections . . . Poverty, malnourishment and poor health services that bring about high death rates are the very factors that give rise to high maternal mortality rates. It is the same women that are most likely to be the worst affected by the indiscriminate promotion of the new hormonal contraceptives . . . </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is other evidence for the case that it is not childbirth <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">per se</EMPHASIS>  that is ending women's lives. A study titled: "Too far to walk: Maternal mortality in context, Part 3"&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and that study is by S. Thaddeus and D. Maine. The study is entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Women's global network for reproductive rights</EMPHASIS> , newsletter No. 37 of October&hyphen;December 1991&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">states: "Delays in the delivery of care are symptomatic of the inadequate care that results from shortages of staff, essential equipment, supplies, drugs and blood as well as inadequate management. Later or wrong diagnosis, and incorrect action by the staff are other factors [which] contribute to delays in the timely provision of needed care . . . <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="827"> In addition to identifying the diagnoses in cases of maternal death, some hospital&hyphen;based studies determine whether or not the deaths were avoidable. They generally find that while a small number of maternal deaths are unavoidable, the large majority are either entirely or probably preventable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"For example, 98 per cent of institutional deaths studied in Tanzania, 94 per cent of maternal deaths studied in Cali, Colombia, 88 per cent of those studied in Vietnam and 80 per cent of those studied in Jamaica and in Lusaka, Zambia, were judged preventable by the respective investigators."</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">According to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Women's International Network News</EMPHASIS>  (WINN), the highest maternal mortality figures in the world are in sub-Saharan Africa. WINN says the highest maternal mortality occurs in countries where female genital mutilation is widely practiced.</PARA>
<PARA>By the way, these quotes are from a book entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The New Imperialism: World Population and the Cairo Conference</EMPHASIS> . The book goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unvaccinated and anaemic women are also more at risk. These are the conditions which need to be rectified but are not, because of the emphasis on population control and family planning which&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>including IPPF, which has its hands out for the scarce money&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">are diverting money from health care and social services.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>At the ministerial seminar on population and development in Canberra last November, Bangaladeshi women's activist Farida Akhter of UBINIG which convened the Bangaladesh symposium appealed to the then Prime Minister of Australia:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If you're giving any money at all, don't give it to the population controllers. We don't have money for health programs. Please, divert it to health programs.</PARA>
<PARA>I am rather pleased that Senator Crowley raised this matter because I believe that it is important that it be studied very carefully and that we do not take the views of persons who have self&hyphen;interest, including IPPF, who have their hands out for the taxpayers' money. Taxpayers' money is thus being diverted from genuine health programs, particularly women's health and education programs required to overcome the major causes of maternal mortality in this world.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to take the opportunity to speak on the third reading in this debate to put an alternative point of view to Senator Harradine who obviously has a very fixed position on this. He is opposed to women having access to abortifacients and his amendments are designed to achieve a ban on abortifacients here in Australia. I do not doubt that he will achieve that through the passing of those amendments with the support of Liberal and Labor parties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For women in Australia, it will be back to a choice basically of surgical intervention or no intervention at all. To put the other side yet again and to say that I am not alone in my opposition to what he is doing here, I have faxes from a number of groups such as the National Council of Women, the Doctors Reform Society, the Australian Women's Health Network, as well as many from the Family Planning Association. I will just briefly read one letter from the National Association of Leading Women's Hospitals. It is written by Dr Gareth Goodier, president of Women Hospitals Australia and it says in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of our member hospitals are concerned that the amendments will continue to restrict access to RU 486, a drug that has been proven to be a cheaper and more effective treatment regime than surgery for women requiring termination of pregnancy. The issue of side effects of this drug has been one of focus, and one that is a furphy, particularly when considering the serious alternative of surgery.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We certainly appreciate that the Minister for Health ought to have some overriding power to veto this drug if in fact expert advice is that the drug is unsafe or if that is what the community has requested. However, the research is overwhelming in its support for the efficacy of this drug. In addition, there has been no such demand from a sizeable proportion of the community particularly women. The current provisions of the Bill mean that yet again women will be denied a choice in their health care.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Clerk has just informed the Senate, we are debating the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996. This is an important bill, and I will go to the reasons in a moment. It is important apart from the reasons inherent in the bill because it is the first bill, I believe, in which the new government has presented a money bill to the Senate, a bill which will raise revenue for the government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One would expect that in their first approach to this chamber with such a piece of legislation they would be careful to set the tone for their administration on these matters. In question time over the last sitting period we have heard government ministers in their answers to any questions which related to the economy refer to the so&hyphen;called `Beazley $8 billion black hole'. We have heard that ad nauseam. Indeed, it seems to be an obligation on government ministers to repeat that phrase at least 50 times during every question time. What they are referring to is not, as they term it, the `Beazley $8 billion black hole', but rather the `Costello con'. In technical terms they are referring to a forecast of what the budget deficit may be based on, parameters that the Treasury identified to the government after the election. Those parameters will change substantially between now and when the budget comes down. Any one of those parameters will dramatically affect the level of the deficit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nonetheless, this fallacious effort at agenda setting in the minds of the electorate has gone on and is the cornerstone upon which the government base all of their other strategies in telling almost all sectors in Australia that they should face cuts. They should do more with less. The razor has been wielded freely and widely across welfare, education, industry</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA>support, health programs&mdash;and so goes the roll call.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The whole edifice of the government's approach to this budget is based on the fallacious assertion of the so-called $8 billion black hole. It is avidly repeated as the justification for widespread cuts to programs which are ideologically inspired&mdash;ideological not in the sense that the government has any particular ideological conviction about balancing its budget, because the coalition's last performances in office do not demonstrate any such conviction whatsoever, but in the sense that it believes in small government and a smaller private sector. Under the cloak of this oft repeated phrase, it is about reducing the size of government services which impact most of all on those in needy positions in our society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have gone into that preamble because this is the first bill that the government has presented to this chamber in which it seeks to raise revenue. Had we continued in government, it is a bill that we would have, in every respect bar one, presented to this chamber. Indeed, when we were in government, we did present it to this chamber, but it lapsed on the parliamentary <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> when parliament was prorogued for the election. As I have said, you would expect the tone for the new administration to be set in this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The extraordinary thing about this bill, which is the one thing different in this legislation from what we had last presented, is that this bill gives money away. It gives money away to quarriers of limestone and part of the rural community. This is at a time when the government is bellowing from the rooftops that everyone should tighten their belts, that programs should be cut and that people should do more with less. It gives money away at a time when welfare is on the table for the scalpel and when, as we heard from the higher education people just this week, education programs are to be cut. At a time of budget stringency, the extraordinary thing about the first bill the government presents to this chamber is that it will give money away. The government estimates the amount it will give away to be in the order of $600,000. It is more than that, but I just cannot turn up the actual reference.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you for interjecting and asking that, Senator Boswell, because that is the point I was going to go on and explain. My recollection is that when we were in government and when we looked at the cost of this provision, the cost estimated to us was in the range between $250,000 and $2 million. It may well be that better calculations have been made to give more precision to the figure. Certainly, I intend to ask questions of that nature in the committee stage, or maybe Senator Parer, who on behalf of the government is shepherding this bill through this chamber, might care to give us, when he replies to the speeches in the second reading debate, some greater specificity as to how that figure is calculated. From my tenure as a minister in the previous government, I recollect that when this bill came through there was a range, and it was between $250,000 and $2 million.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But whether it was 1c or $2 million, the principle is the same. The government identifies an area of the electorate which it is prepared to give money to while telling the rest of the electorate that they should shape up and gear themselves for budget cuts. I believe that what we have here in this example is gross and clear hypocrisy by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It irks me to open my presentation on this bill with a negative threshold point, but the facts require that threshold point to be stated loudly and often. On every occasion that the government proceeds to strop its razor for yet another cut, this point should be made: when it suits the government, it will give a handout and a subsidy to its friends while telling the rest of the community to tighten their belts and do more with less.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996 is familiar to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this chamber. As part of the budget process last year, the then government, the now opposition, recognised that revenue was haemorrhaging by virtue of the diesel fuel rebate scheme. We supported the scheme. We wanted to continue the scheme, but we wanted to focus the scheme on those who had the proper entitlement to it. It is a scheme that provides a substantial rebate, and for all those who are quite properly the beneficiaries of it there are many other players out there in the community looking to minimise their taxation, or looking to evade taxation, who have tried, by resorting to the law, to extend the definition of `eligibility'. At the end of the day, funds were being paid to people that the government never intended them to be paid to. An amendment was needed to bring the act back into focus so that the intended beneficiaries were the beneficiaries, and the unintended free riders who had managed to change the law by judicial interpretation were eliminated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We presented the bill to this chamber. It met a barrage of opposition. One could, if one were cynical, say there was obstruction in this chamber to delay its passage. This task was made easier by the fact that there were some 28 amendments from the government to its own bill and 32 amendments from the opposition and minor parties. The bill went out and came back when it was found that those amendments were not properly transcribed. The intent of the chamber was not passed into legislation. The bill needed to come back and be regularised. I think it came back in about August last year, but it lapsed when the parliament was prorogued because, given the weight of other business, we were not able to get to it on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="830"> Quite rightly, this part of the bill should pass in the body of the bill. We will not do as cynics might say the now government and former opposition did and try to block this bill. Good government requires this legislation to be carried. As a good opposition&mdash;soon to be a government again&mdash;we want to see it carried. We will support those parts of the bill that duplicate what we intended to do when in government. But I do not think there are grounds for supporting the bit that the govern ment has tacked on&mdash;which is a handout to their mates, a breaking of the principle of stringency, and an affront to the budget process they have set themselves. That is the approach they have taken with their first money raising bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Greens have foreshadowed an amendment to the very clause that I have referred to relating to farmers using limestone to combat soil acidification. The Greens have been courteous enough to draw my attention to their amendment outside of the chamber and to explain to me its background and intent. I made appropriately sympathetic noises; however, on closer inspection, I find some difficulties in its drafting. I say that in a constructive voice to convey no lack of sympathy for the amendment's intent but to indicate the technical difficulty that could obstruct its execution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment, which we will debate at greater length in the committee stage, proposes adding provisions to the tax act rather than to this bill. The provisions would be inserted in that place in the tax act which we created when in government to deal with landcare. Landcare is, after all, the most significant environmental issue for this nation. Appropriately, when in government, we made provision in the tax act for deductions in the case of land&hyphen;holders who were trying to recover their land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, I understand and am sympathetic to the amendment but it is poorly drafted and has some technical difficulties. Under the existing act, a taxpayer gets a rebate for landcare work. The Greens' amendment proposes that if a person is not a taxpayer&mdash;that is, they are not in a situation in which they have to pay tax&mdash;they can get a cash refund for this work. The technical difficulty that I refer to is that I am not at all sure that, constitutionally, such a provision could go into the tax act and provide for a payment to a person or entity who is not a taxpayer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As this debate reels on I hope to get further and better particulars on that but it is that issue that causes me to think that, while I am sympathetic with the objective of the amendment, the constitutional provisions may not be there to give effect to it in the form in which <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> it is drafted. My second objection to the amendment is that it inserts into the act a quite lengthy preamble the terms of which, with the greatest of respect, I do not think appropriate to include in an act like the tax act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, this is a bill which, in all respects bar one, we would have presented to this chamber when we were in government. We will not engage in the sort of obstructive behaviour that the now government did when it was in opposition, attempting to embarrass us when we were in government and to fiddle with the revenue stream. We think it appropriate to support the bill and to be consistent on the principles of revenue and the narrowing and better definition of the intent of the diesel fuel rebate scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the point with which I opened that causes me the most grief and concern. If the government were dinkum it would also be consistent on this point. It must be sorely embarrassing to the government that with this, its first bill, it is handing out money while telling everyone else in the country that they are for the chop in some element of payment. While the range of the figures we were advised of when we were in government are modest to say the least, I would appreciate it if Senator Parer, when he closes the second reading debate on behalf of the government, would explain how that figure of $620,000 is calculated so that the efficacy of that amount can be tested. I support those parts of the bill that I referred to but oppose the last bit and I would appreciate some further explanation from the government.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Nearly a year ago the Customs and Excise Legislation Bill was passed by this chamber. Problems with the wording of the amendments have cast doubt on claims for rebates under residential and mining components of the diesel rebate scheme. In the last session we had a bill to remedy these issues but it never reached the floor.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats had prepared an amendment to that bill to allow a diesel rebate for the quarrying of limestone for the de&hyphen;acidification of soil. We are assured that the bill we are debating, the Customs and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="831"> Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996, is essentially the same as that presented last year by the former government but with the addition of a rebate for quarrying limestone for agricultural use.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We acknowledge the importance of de&hyphen;acidification, and the Greens (WA) certainly wish to support this important soil treatment. I do, however, have a few questions. Last year I made the point that soil treatment for de&hyphen;acidification is already 100 per cent deductible under 75D(1B)(c) of the Income Tax Assessment Act. There were apparently some doubts, due to a poorly worded Department of Primary Industries and Energy pamphlet, but these doubts have been clarified, and I understand that the situation that caused them to arise has been clarified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Applying limestone for de&hyphen;acidification is 100 per cent deductible. My understanding is that deductions can also be carried forward under the income equity provisions that allowed businesses with good and bad years to spread costs and obligations. I also pointed out that although limestone has other agricultural uses, use for de&hyphen;acidification generally involves periodic application on a cycle of between four and 10 years. This makes it somewhat easier for farmers to choose the timing of outlays to correspond with what looks like a good year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make that point because at issue is the perennial problem that for farmers landcare expenses involve up-front outlays of capital, where there is no assurance that income will be sufficient to make tax deductibility relevant. In other words, a tax deduction gives no benefit unless there is enough tax obligation for it to be fully used.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> My understanding of the current government amendment is that the intention is to benefit farmers in the interest of landcare. It is not, in my understanding, mainly intended to benefit limestone quarries. The purpose is to reduce the sale cost of limestone to farmers using it for de&hyphen;acidification. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since that is the case, I have real concerns that the government may be creating major problems for itself by setting up an unworkable distinction. The diesel used in limestone quarrying for soil de&hyphen;acidification in agriculture is extreme ly difficult to differentiate from limestone quarried for other purpose. I think they will be placing a very large burden on inspectors and some significant compliance costs on quarries, which will presumably have to prove their claims against an Australian Tax Office audit. While it is clearly the intention that quarries should make the distinction, do the paperwork and pass on the benefits to farmers, there is no guarantee that this will happen. There is no stipulation that benefits should be passed on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government appears to be making the assumption that, because limestone use for cement is generally ground much more finely, it is therefore simple to distinguish non&hyphen;agricultural uses. I remind them that limestone used for cement is less than half the limestone produced, and total agricultural use is about three per cent. Limestone for construction and aggregates is much more difficult to distinguish from agricultural use than cement, and agricultural use is not confined to the definition in the government amendment. Limestone is used for soil dressing for purposes other than de&hyphen;acidification, and also used for on&hyphen;farm roads and other purposes. I really do not think that it will be so easy to distinguish in an audit and, in any case, will require record keeping of evidence by the quarry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also note the quarries have indicated that they would like to expand this window of opportunity. In the committee last year, they talked about the cost of limestone for agriculture, including the cost of roadworks, clearing the overburden, and other costs extremely difficult to separate from general quarry costs, unless the agricultural limestone comes from a separate quarry&mdash;which is extremely unlikely and probably uneconomic, adding substantially to the cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I imagine that quarries may consider the whole thing too hard and not bother with the paperwork, and could charge farmers a standard rate for limestone. I imagine that even if they wished to give farmers some advantage, it would not be full advantage of the rebate, since the quarries have entailed real costs and to pass on all the advantage would make the rebate a negative benefit for the quarries. Either way, the benefit to farmers would be <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="832"> substantially less than might be imagined from this legislation. The costs in terms of ATO auditing and monitoring will be imposed on government, and there is potential for revenue leakage to other areas of limestone quarrying, which is by far the major purpose of limestone quarrying. This amendment is meant to benefit farmers. I notice that I am short of time. I will endeavour to explain my amendments to Senator Cook, who has questions about them, when I complete my speech.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>I rise to speak on the Australia&hyphen;Indonesia security agreement. This agreement, signed by Indonesian foreign minister Ali Alatas and former foreign minister Gareth Evans on 18 December in Jakarta, is another indictment of Australia's human rights approach. It smacks of the continuing superiority of Defence riding roughshod over foreign affairs and human rights policy. It is also a slap in the face for indigenous people fighting for self&hyphen;determination and democratic rights in Indonesia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition government's response to this treaty in December was one of democratic process&mdash;hardly the central issue, although it was significant. The present Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer), who at the time was the shadow minister, responded aptly with comments that the definition of `adverse challenges' in the treaty was too broad and should have been limited to `external challenges'. The coalition has since been silent about the breadth of the treaty and has been busy working to upgrade it through annual security `Polmin' talks between Indonesian and Australian foreign affairs and defence ministers.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both approaches by the major parties have put security issues above human rights, and will put Australia in a difficult position in lining up with Indonesian security concerns with others in the region. Despite the coalition's noises before the election to further the issue of East Timor during their time in government, this treaty and its proposed strengthening may well set back the cause of East Timor many years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australia&hyphen;Indonesia security agreement is a slap in the face for East Timor and an injustice to the people fighting for self-determination in Indonesia. Article 2 of the treaty is the most serious component which binds Australia into complicity with helping to combat Indonesia's security threats. Article 2 of the treaty states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Parties undertake to consult each other in the case of adverse challenges to either party or to their common security interests and, if appropriate, consider measures which might be taken either individually or jointly and in accordance with the processes of each Party.</PARA>
<PARA>Indonesia, as we all know, does not face external threats but focuses its military strength on perceived internal security threats such as people fighting for self-determination, democratic rights, freedom of speech and the right to unionisation. Therefore, due to the broad wording which makes reference to any `adverse challenges to either party', it is highly likely that Australia at some stage may be called upon to assist with civil conflict in areas such as East Timor, Aceh and West Papua. Both East Timor and West Papua have Australian economic interests such as oil investments and the 18 per cent owned Freeport goldmine which could be deemed to be within Australia's security interests to protect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This treaty does not necessarily invoke an obligation for Australia to intervene in Indonesia's security problems but it does give a treaty basis for Australia to get involved if it wants to and allows Indonesians to ask us to get involved with Australia having to answer a public yes or no, making it difficult for us to object.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a sad and shocking situation where Australia cannot see the links between its role <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="833"> in overseas development and security challenges to itself. Australian companies have been involved in developments such as the Ok Tedi mine in Papua New Guinea; Freeport mine in West Papua, which is 18 per cent Australian owned; and Australian subsidiary CRA in Bougainville. These mines have all led to environmental degradation and insecurity, social and economic inequality. These are the roots of conflict which have been violently suppressed by the national governments in Papua New Guinea and Indonesia and have resulted in countless cases of human rights abuse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia then sees this visible conflict as a threat to itself and sees this as a justification for arming and training the oppressors. This goes on at the expense of the ordinary people fighting for democracy, political and civil rights and freedom of expression&mdash;things that Australia is meant to value and work towards as a decent international citizen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This treaty then is about keeping and strengthening this amoral and unethical relationship with Indonesia. Instead of pressing this regime to change the way it treats its people, we help them to suppress them. We do this to protect our economic investments that were never viable if they were not environmentally sustainable. We also do this to placate a regime which can secure our investments for us through violence and repression. We do this out of some ridiculous notion that Indonesian internal threats, or pro self-determination and democracy movements, are somehow a threat to us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government should wake up and deal with the roots of conflict, bringing in codes of conduct for companies operating overseas, and it should monitor the human rights situation closely. There are projects proposed that could ignite such as Bougainville. West Papua and Lihir are often mentioned. Our aid programs could do more to harvest community development which makes the community self&hyphen;sustaining. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>This document is from the Australian Science and Technology Council, a council comprised of eminent Australians most of whom are scientists but some of whom are social scientists&mdash;not scientists in the sense classically ascribed to physicists, chemists or engineers. They are all eminent and are all concerned to try to peer into the future to see what Australia's needs will be in the year 2010.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a report that rightly comes to the Senate under the hand of the current Minister for Science and Technology (Mr McGauran), and I acknowledge that. Nonetheless, and I might say this with some pride, it is a report that I was associated with in its infancy. The council approached me as the then science minister indicating their intention to carry out a foresight study in order to anticipate Australia's future needs so that we could better plan to meet those needs in a more intelligent way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have followed the processes engaged in by ASTEC as they have evolved this report. I have spent some time in direct session with them contributing in my small way&mdash;and I emphasise `small way'&mdash;what I could as science minister the perspective of the then government about the challenges of the future.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Senator. They have produced an outstanding report, which I commend to honourable senators and to the wider community, which is the first in a series of reports. ASTEC intends to update their findings and get a better definition on those findings as the months and years roll by so that we in Australia can engage what is unique for us but not uncommon elsewhere in the world&mdash;that is, a concerted effort to try to intelligently forecast the future or at the very least identify major challenges for the country in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The executive summary sets out the key forces for change identified by ASTEC that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="834"> will influence Australia by 2010. They are, firstly, the global integration process; secondly, the application of information and communications technology, which they identify as one of the most revolutionary changes that can affect modern society; thirdly, the move by popular demand to environmental sustainability to obtain a more sustainable environment for the world; and, fourthly, the advances in biological technologies. They see those as the four key forces for change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not for me to go on and try to paraphrase what is an excellent and full report. To do so would be to do an injustice to it because I would miss elements and nuances that are quite important. What I do want to say is that this report comes down very much on the side of encouraging an innovation culture in Australia: a culture of being able to adapt existing modes of doing things to new stimuli or new needs in society by keeping a flexible and open mind; of being able to take the best of what is around and use it in a way that meets the social, economic, community and political needs of our society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is against that background that I find it absolutely unbelievable that the coalition should have forecast just before the election&mdash;without sufficient notice for industry to deal with it&mdash;and now, in government, seems hell&hyphen;bent on pursuing the entire abolition of the programs enunciated by us in government in the innovation statement. Australians have got too used to seeing inventions in this country commercialised by foreigners, to the greater reward of those foreign corporations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The innovation statement was about setting a national innovation agenda in place so that the creativity of Australian scientists could be brought to the market as goods or services by Australian firms to win a greater place for Australian companies, and greater and more intelligent employment by Australians, in the world market place.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) It is recognised that jobseekers in these groups are at high risk of becoming long term unemployed and they are therefore immediately eligible for most Labour Market Programs (LMPs) upon registration as unemployed with the Commonwealth Employment Service. There is a wide range of assistance within which the needs of such groups can be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Women who are receiving a widow allowance or widow pension from the Department of Social Security can receive assistance under the Jobs, Education and Training strategy which provides information, advice, training, job search and employment placement assistance specific to their individual needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Jobseekers with substantial time out of the work force (defined as little or no work experience over a period of three years or more) are immediately eligible for most LMPs and case management.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) 66,003 LMP places were taken up by women over the age of 40 years; and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="837"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) 19,764 of these were taken up by women over 50 years of age.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The latest available outcomes information is for clients who left program assistance in the year to end September 1995. A total of 38,839 women aged over 40 years, including 10,793 aged over 50 years, left assistance in that period. Post Program Monitoring survey data show that:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Is the Minister concerned about the tax minimisation arrangements which have occurred by the Queensland Professional Credit Union (QPCU) allowing its General Manager to convert accrued long service leave and annual leave as a direct deposit to his superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) How widespread is the practice of companies directing before&hyphen;tax employee payments into superannuation funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Will the Government introduce legislation to outlaw the practice of using salary sacrifices as a means of minimising tax.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) Will the Government encourage the ATO to pursue the amount of lost revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) Will the members of the QPCU have to `foot the bill' for taxation reimbursement, legal fees, payroll tax and penalties incurred because of the arrangement described in (1).</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The secrecy provisions of the income tax laws prevent the Commissioner of Taxation from advising me about a specific arrangement entered into by QPCU.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In general terms however, there is no cause for concern as these types of arrangements do not involve any tax minimisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Salary sacrifice arrangements occur where an employer and an employee negotiate the mix of cash and non cash remuneration to be received for services rendered. To be effective, the employee must enter into the agreement and contractually forgo the right to the amount of salary that is to be sacrificed before the point at which any relevant employment services have occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where the entitlement to remuneration has already accrued, there can be no salary sacrifice arrangements. For example, in a situation where an entitlement to receive long service leave and annual leave has already been established, any attempt to subsequently salary sacrifice those amounts will not be effective for income tax purposes. Rather the gross payment (ie. accrued long service leave and annual leave) made to a superannuation fund as contributions for an employee would, pursuant to sections 19 and 25 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (ITAA), be income derived by the employee and would, by virtue of section 221A of the ITAA, be salary or wages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, such an amount should be taxed to the employee at his/her marginal tax rate and the sum transferred to the superannuation fund would be net of tax.</PARA>
<PARA><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> (2) Indeterminable. Salary sacrifice, as described in (1) above, is an accepted form of salary packaging arrangements. It is also relevant to note that the fringe benefits tax laws apply to non cash remu <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="838"></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">neration of employees, although superannuation contributions made by an employer on behalf of an employee are not subject to the fringe benefits tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) No amendments to the ITAA are necessary (see (2) above).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) There is no loss of revenue from the arrangements described in (1). The ATO has an ongoing compliance program to ensure that any salary sacrifice arrangements are entered into correctly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) There is no amount of lost revenue from the arrangements as described.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) The Commissioner of Taxation is unable to comment on this point.</PARA>
