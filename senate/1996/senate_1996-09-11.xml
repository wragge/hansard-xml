<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The agreement on the development of a regional plan for the Hinchinbrook area is a major achievement. Commonwealth involvement in the regional planning process gives it the capacity to address in an integrated manner the full range of developments that could impact on world heritage values.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The objective of this Bill is to protect Australia's native&hyphen;forest estate from the ravages of an unsustainable native&hyphen;forest&hyphen;logging industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This objective is achieved in the following fashion:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> By phasing out woodchip exports from native forests by 1 January 1999;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the first full year of operations of this Bill, 1997, allowable woodchip exports will be cut from the current level to four million tonnes. By 1998, the ceiling will be two million tonnes. And by 1 <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> January 1999, the maximum permissible level of export woodchipping will be zero.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1997, the Bill will extend a mantle of protection over areas that have been identified by experts as having World Heritage values; that are crucial habitats for plants and animals that have become rare or threatened; rainforests, and natural vegetation surrounding rainforests; oldgrowth forests covering 10 hectares or more; and wilderness. The Bill brings effect to these objectives by using the Commonwealth Government's constitutional Corporations Power&mdash;a power that was part of the Hawke Government's armoury in saving the Franklin River in 1983, but which governments have been too timid to employ in protecting the environment since then.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By protecting these areas, the Bill gives effect to the wishes of a majority of Australians, as expressed in a public&hyphen;opinion survey carried out by Roy Morgan Research and released publicly by the Minister for the Environment on Wednesday 4 September 1996. The survey categorically shows Australians' love for the natural environment and its wildlife. It shows that ninety&hyphen;nine percent of people want wilderness protected while 80 percent believe that protecting wilderness is more important than economic development. It is a survey that has been comprehensively ignored by this Government in its recent spate of decisions that potentially condemn our forests, Kakadu, Hinchinbrook and other wild areas to destruction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill aims to secure for the future the wonderful forests of this nation, from the South&hyphen;West wilderness of Tasmania to the karri forests of Western Australia, and from East Gippsland up through the forests of New South Wales to Queensland. In those forests is a myriad of wildlife, some abundant, but much rare and exquisite. In these forests is an endless resource for human adventure, wonderment and inspiration. The forests are also the backbone for a range of sustainable and labour&hyphen;intensive industries, from tourism to apiculture.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill aims to bring true sustainability to the management of the logging industry. It aims to look after the interests of people in the rural communities whose future well&hyphen;being is currently threatened by one of the most insensitive, unpopular and destructive industries this country has ever seen.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill is introduced into the Australian Parliament at a time of crisis for the world's forests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Right across the planet, natural forests are being cut down at the greatest rate in history. Temperate, tropical and boreal forests are being cleared, chipped or transmogrified at increasing rates.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tropical rainforests are being destroyed at the rate of one hectare every second. That is equivalent to an area of rainforest the size of Victoria each year. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3206"> This assault on the world's most diverse form of habitat means that we are losing species to extinction at the rate of at least 50 a day. The ancestral homes of indigenous peoples such as the Penan in the rainforests of Borneo and the Yanomami in Brazil are being misappropriated and razed. In New Guinea, Sarawak, the Solomon Islands, Brazil and Zaire, tropical rainforests are being destroyed or sized up for destruction by marauding trans&hyphen;national companies, including companies such as Mitsubishi, which are household names.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the temperate zone, the situation is no better.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Only 14 million hectares, or 35%, of the original 40 million hectares of temperate rainforest remain on Earth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The world's greatest tracts of temperate forest are in Siberia. As the economy of Russia is opened up to international influences, so too are its forests. They are subject to an increasing assault by Japanese, Korean and United States logging companies. This is threatening the continued existence of the Siberian Tiger and affecting the rights of many indigenous people of Siberia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Chile, over 1.5 million hectares of native forests have been cleared for woodchipping and plantations since 1975. Annual exports of woodchips now exceed three million tonnes; 90 percent is sent to Japan.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Pacific north&hyphen;west of the USA and Canada, temperate forests have been cable&hyphen;logged by some of the most severe logging operations in the world. Entire catchments have been scalped by huge cable&hyphen;logging machines. The resultant erosion and the pollution from a myriad of antiquated pulpmills have badly affected the riverine eco&hyphen;systems as well as industries such as salmon fishing. Hundreds of peaceful protesters, including many of the indigenous people, have been arrested for opposing these destructive operations in places such as British Columbia's Clayoquot Sound.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Australia, most of our tropical rainforests have been logged or cleared for crops like sugar. Most of what's left is now protected from logging, but the situation with temperate forests is dire.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has some of the world's most voracious woodchip&hyphen;export companies. Woodchipping has driven logging into the heart of some of our most precious native forests, into places like Ellery Creek or Errinundra in East Gippsland, the Coolangubra, Deua and Tantawangalo forests in southern New South Wales, the majestic karri forests of  Western Australia, and the Tarkine, Great Western Tiers and South&hyphen;West of Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Woodchipping would have to be the country's most unpopular industry. Over 80 percent of opinion&hyphen;poll respondents consistently oppose the woodchipping of our native forests. Hundreds of thousands of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australians have voted against woodchipping with their feet&mdash;either by attending rallies in Australia's cities, or by standing in front of the bulldozers in the bush. Scientists have castigated the industry for its unsustainability; economists have condemned the public subsidies which keep it going.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yet woodchipping expands at an ever&hyphen;increasing rate. The industry, aware of the strength and depth of public feeling for Australia's native forests, has bankrolled a slick and cynical public&hyphen;relations campaign. Each year, millions of dollars that the industry gets from flogging our forests go into a massive public&hyphen;relations campaign carried out at several levels.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is bullying of the media&mdash;recently, the ABC's "7.30 Report" publicly apologised for having offended the woodchip industry in two of its stories in late 1995. Yet the media, including the ABC, also run stories that put the industry's case in a positive light. Community groups representing the conservation issues simply don't have the resources to counter this concerted media&hyphen;lobbying by highly&hyphen;paid PR consultants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Then there's the so&hyphen;called "Forest Protection Society". This organisation is one of the biggest lies ever perpetrated on the Australian public. How can journalists legitimise this sham by even referring to this industry front by that name, by calling "destruction" "protection"? Clearly, the logging industry has done its market research and knows that the public likes forests and hates woodchipping, and has named its creation accordingly, with enormous contempt for the truth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Then there are the millions of dollars spent on elaborate TV advertising, the strategically&hyphen;timed  <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3207"> spiking of trees to smear the conservation movement, the glossy leaflets with their misleading messages (so appropriately called "mis&hyphen;information kits" by a prominent industry spokesperson in a moment of rare truthfulness), and the force of lobbyists in the corridors of Parliament at crucial times.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Meanwhile, unions like the CFMEU meekly accept the job&hyphen;shedding doled out by the woodchip companies, and go and blockade Wilderness Society shops.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The industry attempts to justify its existence by virtue of the jobs it generates. Yet employment in the native&hyphen;forests industry has plummeted. In Tasmania alone, over 5000 jobs in the industry were lost between 1975 and 1995. Eighteen months after blockading this Parliament and bringing the government to its knees over woodchipping, blockaders are being sacked and the industry, despite its open slather on wild forests, is on its own knees, with the CFMEU murmuring industrial action to the winds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The industry claims to be sawlog driven, that it only chips the waste on the forest floor. This is one of its most specious claims. In Tasmania, the average logging coupe on public land yields five percent sawn timber and over 90 percent chips. Similar ratios exist in other states. In parts of New South Wales, logging operations yield 100 percent woodchips and zero sawlogs. The trend over the last 20 years has been for our native forests to be logged more and more for woodchips and less and less for sawlogs, as a graph of woodchip exports versus sawn&hyphen;timber production amply demonstrates.</PARA>
<PARA><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3208"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And as the trees in plantations established in the 1950s, 60s, 70s and 80s are cut, or mature, the native&hyphen;forests&hyphen;logging industry becomes all the more indefensible. Australia simply does not need to touch its pristine native&hyphen;forest estate to provide basic commodities such as building timber and pulpwood. We have over a million hectares of plantations around the nation to provide those products. Those plantations are already displacing  <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3209"> markets for wood products from native forests. The following graph clearly shows production of sawn timber from plantations displacing production of sawn timber from native forests. That trend is set to accelerate dramatically over the next five years as more and more of our vast resource of plantation wood comes on stream. If we do not need native forests to provide sawn timber, the industry's rationale for logging native forests collapses.</PARA>
<PARA><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To create thousands of long&hyphen;term, secure jobs in the wood&hyphen;products industry, we do not need to be cutting down more native forests, or planting more plantations. We do need to encourage industry to invest in the processing of the plantation resource that is already in the ground. We need to stop underpricing wood from native forests, thereby undercutting the plantation sector. We need to stop propping up an unsustainable, destructive, unpopular job&hyphen;shedding loser of an industry, and get behind the secure resource of the future by encouraging the processing of plantation&hyphen;grown wood.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Earlier, I mentioned the arrests of  forest&hyphen;defenders at Canada's Clayoquot Sound. Australia, too, has seen thousands of arrests of peaceful protesters over the last ten years. In southern New South Wales, the Daishowa woodchip mill at Eden is the late 20th&hyphen;century equivalent of the whaling that occurred there last century. This mill is consuming hundreds of thousands of tonnes of woodchips from thousands of hectares of forest in a radius of hundreds of  kilometres. Wilderness, oldgrowth and the habitat of rare or endangered species like the Long&hyphen;Footed Potoroo and Powerful Owl are all being destroyed by this one monstrous mill, which is wholly owned outside Australia. More than 1000 citizens have been arrested in peaceful protests against its operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The impacts of the infamous Daishowa mill are felt over the border, in Victoria's East Gippsland. This is the heartland of Victoria's remaining forested wilderness. Yet many of these ancient forests of mixed eucalypts and rainforest&hyphen;species have been cynically catalogued as "regrowth" by that state's forestry bureaucrats. Bulldozers and chainsaws have penetrated the glorious stands of trees at Ellery and Errinundra as a result.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similar woodchip&hyphen;driven operations are blighting the scenic forests of the Otways and Central Highlands of Victoria. Queensland, until now mercifully free of this industry, can now be opened up for chipping by the policies of the new federal and state governments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the lush hinterland of northern NSW, woodchipping carried out by the giant multi&hyphen;national Boral has been picking the eyes out of the superb stands of oldgrowth stands. It remains to be seen what the long and convoluted New South Wales forest process will do with these forests and their wildlife. Currently, the signs are ominous.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the south&hyphen;west of Western Australia, despite years of vocal community opposition, woodchip companies&mdash;aided and abetted by the notorious Department of Conservation and Land Management&mdash;are furthering their agenda of flattening the giant oldgrowth karri trees. Rare native species such as red&hyphen;tailed and white&hyphen;tailed black cockatoos and native tiger cats (chudditch) are having prime habitat flattened around them. In the vast, arid state <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3210"> of Western Australia, tall native forest exists only in small pockets of the south&hyphen;west. Destruction of these oldgrowth remnants is a national travesty.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Which brings me to my home state, Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tasmania has some of the world's most significant tracts of temperate forest, including some of the world's oldest. It has Australia's greatest tract of temperate rainforest, straddling the catchments of the Savage and Donaldson rivers in the Tarkine wilderness. We have a wealth of unique wildlife, in habitats ranging from the sodden rainforests of the west to the dry&hyphen;sclerophyll woodlands of the East Coast. Tasmania also has one of the world's greatest tracts of temperate wilderness&mdash;a great wild region of glaciated mountain peaks, lake&hyphen;dotted plateaux, fabulous wild rivers and gorges, and the tallest forests in the Southern Hemisphere.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yet these natural wonders are being systematically eroded by Australia's most rapacious woodchip industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tiny Tasmania exports more woodchips than all mainland states combined. Two thirds of Australia's woodchip&hyphen;export quota comes from the island state. There are four major woodchip mills, which between them grind up more than three million tonnes of native forest per annum. The newest of them, the Hampshire mill near Burnie, can chip over 1.2 million tonnes of forest per annum. It's the biggest woodchip mill in the Southern Hemisphere but it employs just 10 people. The great pile of rainforest woodchips languishing on the wharf at Burnie was created by this forest&hyphen;eating colossus.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tasmania is the only state where rainforests are not only logged, but also cleared, chipped, firebombed, poisoned and replaced by eucalypt plantations. This atrocity is occurring on the private estate of North Forest Products (a subsidiary of North Broken Hill)&mdash;100,000 hectares acquired from the Van Diemens Land Company.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tasmania is the Australian cable&hyphen;logging epicentre. There are more than a dozen of these machines eating away at oldgrowth forests on the steep valleys and ridges of this island's world&hyphen;famous mountain scenery.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tasmania's unique biodiversity is also under threat as the bulldozers, cable loggers and chainsaws go marauding through the dry&hyphen;sclerophyll forests of the East Coast and north, and into the remnant oldgrowth forests on the steep slopes of the north&hyphen;east mountains.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The spectacular wilderness areas of Tasmania are being eroded as some of Australia's most brutal clearfelling operations penetrate deeper into the remote valleys of the South&hyphen;West and Tarkine. The Great Western Tiers, the dominant scenic feature between Devonport and Launceston have also been <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> earmarked by Forestry Tasmania for roading and logging.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On private land, the situation is no better. Forty percent of Tasmania's forests lie in private hands, many of them belonging to corporate woodchip giants such as Boral and North Forest Products. Habitats of rare and endangered plants and animals throughout the state are being blitzed. The Government's newly&hyphen;announced policy of exempting clearance of so&hyphen;called "degraded" native forests on private land from the woodchip&hyphen;export quota means that these forests are now on line for the biggest assault ever.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Around Tasmania, small, vulnerable communities of people have had their treasured lifestyles blighted by the extent and severity of the woodchippers' onslaught. The tranquillity of their neighbourhoods has been shattered by the din of chainsaws, bulldozers and logtrucks. Supplies of drinking water have been sullied by eroded soils or chemical herbicides. Local wildlife has been poisoned by 1080. Favourite beauty spots and walking tracks have been ruined. Local resources of craftwood and sawlogs have been pulverised in the chippers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over the years, I've personally received representations from local residents, landowners and small businesses in the Tasmanian rural communities of Wielangta, Geeveston, Buckland, Derby, Ranelagh, Jackeys Marsh, Lorinna, Reedy Marsh, Bruny Island, Koonya, Murdunna, Hampshire, Weegeena, Cygnet, Bicheno and many other hamlets, as well as from the larger provincial centres. As well as the indifference of the industry, they've had to deal with the obfuscations of local forestry officials, the inertia of state environmental agencies, and the hostility of many of their elected representatives from both Liberal and Labor camps. I feel that I'm here in this chamber, presenting this bill, to stand up for courageous people who for years have had to suffer the orchestrated attacks of industry front&hyphen;groups, like the falsely&hyphen;named Forest Protection Society, or unions which have become corporate patsies, like the forests branch of the CFMEU.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If organisations like these really cared for the forest workers, they'd turn their attention to companies like North Forest Products and Boral. These corporations have axed thousands of the jobs they say are so sacrosanct. In its 1993 half&hyphen;yearly report, for example, North boasted of having shed nearly six hundred jobs in six months. This was in the wake of the infamous Burnie dispute, when the company, having been given all it wanted by way of Labor's "resource security" legislation, turned on its own employees with an unprecedented attack on employment&hyphen;levels and workers' conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Meanwhile, the Tasmanian woodchip&hyphen;export quota has moved steadily upwards, from its ominous beginnings in 1969, to two million tonnes in the mid&hyphen;1980s, to 2.889 million of the 1985 EIS, to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3211"> Labor's three million in 1995. Now it looks like it could end up as high as 4.5 million tonnes by the turn of the century, unless action is taken. Every day, Tasmanians wake up with less forest and wildlife, and yet the legal rate of destruction is getting bigger.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In short, Tasmania's plight makes it the forest&hyphen;destruction epicentre in a nation where successive governments have raised woodchip&hyphen;exports to obscene levels.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill aims to redress these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When this Bill becomes law, these levels of woodchipping and the premeditated destruction of our native forests will, within three years, become a thing of the past&mdash;like whaling.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, I urge every Honourable Senator to search her or his conscience on Australia's wild forest heritage and to support this Bill through the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Senator Lees's speech read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill is one of the most important environment initiatives to come before the Senate. It is with grave concern for the future of our forests, our soils, our water catchments, our unique biodiversity and the jobs of many workers that the Australian Democrats and the Australian Greens present it today.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The timber industry is at a cross road.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Firstly, polls have consistently shown that at least 80% of Australians want to stop chipping our native forests. Secondly, soft wood sawmillers are increasing their share of the industry as soft woods are increasingly substituted for hardwoods; thirdly, there is significant job shedding due to mechanisation and overlogging; and fourthly the debts built up by the native forest logging industry are growing steadily.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is worth noting that over 90% of job shedding in the timber industry in recent decades has been due to mechanisation, restructuring, overlogging and the concurrent shift from a sawlog driven industry to an export woodchip driven industry, rather than conservation initiatives. Over the last 20 years the number of jobs in the native forest industry has declined by 20,000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The hardwood products industry of Australia has become a ravenous dinosaur which we can no longer afford to prop up. It is clear that at present, we do not have a sustainable forest industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recently, the Victorian Government, in one year, put $90 million dollars into the logging of old growth and hardwood forests for a return of $40 million, an effective subsidy of $50 million. There are 23 types of effective subsidy to the forest industry and the combined debt of the forestry commissions in Australia is now five billion <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> dollars. Penalties for infringements are rarely, if ever, applied.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also true that export woodchipping enables the native forest industry to spread its costs over a wider base and without this native forest logging would not continue in many areas. But it is also true that native forest based woodchipping is completely incompatible with ecological, and therefore economic, sustainability. You cannot both protect forests and allow this excessive level of native forest clearing to continue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is salutary to consider why we are seeing such a concerted push by the export woodchip industry to vastly increase the amount of timber taken from our native forests this year. It is because we are currently witnessing a temporary price surge for export woodchips&mdash;but this will be probably be a very short term phenomenon. Plantations in China, Brazil, and South Africa are set to come on stream and as they do we will see a systematic fall in prices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unfortunately the current window of commercial opportunity could be at great cost to Australian native forests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sadly, the other reason the chipping companies are pushing so hard is that they know the people of Australia want their forests saved and they can see the writing on the wall, they know this is their last chance to ensure resource security from the Governments and they are pushing as hard as they can to get it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the positive side of the ledger, more than sixty percent of Australia's onshore wood products are sourced  from plantation stock and that figure is growing for good commercial reasons. It has been predicted that this could triple by the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current dilemma facing the Federal Government over the protection of our native forests, and providing a secure future for the timber industry and its workers, has a solution. This crisis has provided Australia with an opportunity to move plantation timber for all our timber needs and to encourage the rapid expansion of plantations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Excessive subsidies for the cutting of native forests have had the effect of slowing down some investment in pine and other plantations. The Native Forest Protection Bill will encourage, for the first time, a legal obligation to ensure the timber industry becomes sustainable and becomes free from controversy and conflict.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So what do the Democrats want to see?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We want to see a wood products industry that will maintain and create employment without destroying Australia's old growth and wilderness forests. We want to see an industry that is plantation based and not undermined by Government&hyphen;subsidised chipping of native forests. We want to see an industry that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3212"> provides long term jobs and that cannot happen if the industry relies on a rapidly disappearing resource base.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where necessary adjustment assistance packages for workers may need to be implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Native Forest Protection Bill has an immediate commitment to exclude logging in high conservation value areas implementing legislative mechanisms available to the Commonwealth. Further there must be prohibition of all logging in old growth and wilderness areas. These coupes should form the beginning of a new National Reserve System assessed and put in place on public land as an urgent priority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will be followed by a progressive ban on exports of woodchips from native forests which we believe will encourage the utilisation of existing, and rapid expansion of new, hardwood and softwood plantations</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Democrats believe that plantations must be put to the fullest viable commercial use with maximum processing in Australia of the wood products including sawn timber, pulp and paper, wood based panels and veneer. The wood products industry should be totally plantation based by the year 2000</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Packages should be designed specifically to help farmers develop plantations as part of an integrated cropping system on agricultural land. However new plantations must be established on already cleared land and no clearing of native forest permitted in order to establish plantations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While beyond the scope of this bill we believe all subsidies for the logging of native forests must be removed and there should be introduction of a saw log levy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Research and development of better techniques and products would also encourage more efficient milling and establishment of further processing. Pulp and paper mills supplied by plantations should be developed which are non&hyphen;polluting and energy and water efficient.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no doubt that there will be a detrimental impact on jobs in some rural communities, although jobs will be created in others. However, this must be seen in the context of the thousands of jobs which have disappeared in the industry due to over clearing and mechanisation and the ones which will be lost if the industry becomes more unsustainable. Timber industry workers who lose their jobs from phasing out native forest logging should be given an opportunity to move to jobs created in towns relying on plantations. They will also find new opportunities in value added processing, management of Reserves, and ecotourism.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the expiry last year of the bounty arrangements on recycled paper (previously  negotiated by <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Democrats), there are concerns the Australian recycling industry could collapse under the current taxation regime. While beyond the scope of this bill, the Democrats will continue to call for a reduction in sales tax on recycled paper and paper products as this will assist in reducing the demand for virgin pulp (and hence native forest and woodchips) in order to complement the objectives of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government will cry "loss of dollars", an claim it is "too expensive to protect our forests". We argue that this is a very narrow and short sighted view.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If you include the loss of water catchment areas, the loss of tourism opportunities, the loss of carbon absorbing trees and then take off all the subsidies, we see the ledger balanced. If you consider all those things on which it is so hard to put a value: small and large marsupials; spectacular parrots, a wide variety of  honeyeaters and the powerful owl; fish, frogs and water plants; rainforest and all that lives within it; the value is so great the decision should be an immediate cessation of logging.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill offers the timber industry an opportunity to become much stronger, to become self&hyphen;sustaining and to provide many more long term employment opportunities for its workers.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FX5">Senator MURPHY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The motion relates to the sale of King Island Dairy's property on King Island to a company known as Transequity. There are three very important points to be made as to why the motion ought to be carried and why there ought to be a proper investigation of the matters. Despite the fact that there have been some inquiries and investigations on the matter, they have been of a desktop nature and not of a thorough nature, and there have been no, or very limited, interviews with the people involved in either of the companies or, indeed, with the government of the day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">King Island Dairy Products had a loan of near to $1 million from the Tasmanian government through the Tasmanian Development Authority, and the government took the decision in 1986 to place the company in the hands of receivers. It is very interesting that, despite an outstanding debt of almost $1 million, the government took the decision, and directed the receivers, to sell the property, which as at 12 September 1986 was valued at almost $1.7 million by the receiver managers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a document, which I might seek to table later, signed by the receiver managers, and it gives the estimated value of the property as being $1.692 million. That was just three weeks before the property was sold. It provided a net return to the Tasmanian government of some $86,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some very serious matters relating to this issue. The property was sold for $300,000; it was valued at $1.692 just three weeks before the receivers sold it. It was subsequently sold, less than 29 months later, for $5 million. Transequity would be very pleased with the profit received from that sale. I do not think that there would have been many property sales around that time. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3215"> The Kirk family purchased the property in 1978 for $286,000, and it was sold in 1986 for just $300,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a range of issues that do need thorough investigation, and that is why this motion should be carried. At the end of the day, the Kirk family should be given justice through having the matter properly investigated&mdash;not through an investigation that will be of a disservice. There needs to be a proper investigation. I hope that the motion is carried, and I hope we will see the Treasurer direct the ASC to conduct a proper investigation. In fact, I would like very much to see an independent investigation so that it is properly and thoroughly investigated, for no other reason than to provide the Kirk family with some form of proper justice.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That regulations 7 and 8 of the Migration Regulations (Amendment), as contained in Statutory Rules 1996 No. 75 and made under the Migration Act 1958, be disallowed.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not intend to speak for much longer now than I would have earlier on in the proceedings but I do understand the need for senators to participate in this debate. The opposition opposes these regulations because we feel these regulations are not regulations in the interests of good government, nor are they in the interest of allowing full parliamentary scrutiny of a very important area of public policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effect of regulations 233 and 238 would be to remove the list of benefits which are currently covered by assurances of support from the regulations and therefore allow the minister to specify them by notice in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS>. In essence, they are the regulations we are concerned about. We are concerned about them because the regulations would remove from parliamentary scrutiny any aspect of ministerial decision making in terms <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of what is covered under assurances of support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The remaining regulations for us are innocuous and we do not have any problem with them. But we do have a problem with the principle that says, `We'll take away parliamentary scrutiny from what is covered by an assurance of support and allow a minister at his or her own discretion to make that decision.' We are concerned because the regulations as proposed by the government would allow the government to add any benefit, entitlement or payment to the list of assurances of support at will. That is the crunch of this particular issue. The consequence of allowing the regulations proposed by the government would be, for instance, parliamentary scrutiny of legislation that we are currently debating in respect of the Department of Social Security two&hyphen;year waiting period for migrants could very well be undermined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the assurances of support do not remove a person's entitlement to social security, they do give the Department of Social Security the power to recover an equivalent amount from the person who signed the assurance. For instance, removing the schedule of benefits from the regulations and allowing the minister to add new benefits by notice in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS> will provide the government with an opportunity to get around the difficulties it currently faces in the Senate in getting approval for the Department of Social Security two&hyphen;year waiting period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister, for instance, would be able to gazette all those entitlements or benefits covered by assurances and support. He could then proceed to make an assurance of support compulsory for all family reunion therefore effectively achieving much of what is intended by the bill without the need for the bill to pass through the Senate. That is one particular instance of these regulations allowing a minister the capacity to subvert, to avoid, the scrutiny of parliament. It is for that reason that we think these regulations need to be opposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Essentially, the principle is: if something is going to be covered, if some benefit is going to be made available, if some benefit is going <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3216"> to be taken back, then there needs to be parliamentary scrutiny of it. Departmental scrutiny of ministerial decision making is not sufficient to cover this situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can go on, for instance, applying your mind to what sort of legislative scrutiny can be avoided if the government has its way and gets these regulations through. For instance, although all refugee and humanitarian categories are currently exempt from the two&hyphen;year waiting period legislation, they would be caught in the compulsory assurance provision and the Department of Social Security would also have the power to recover such payments from people coming in here under refugee and humanitarian categories unless there was some further exemptions provided for, and those exemptions have not been provided for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The basic principle is clear. I anticipate there will be some support for the opposition's position in opposing these regulations. The basic principle is: if a benefit is to be granted, if a benefit is to be withdrawn, if a benefit is to be denied, then let the parliament have some capacity to scrutinise government decision making here. Don't do it through the backdoor. Don't allow the minister in the absence of parliamentary scrutiny to be able to make such decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a bad principle that the government wants to follow here. I am sure Senator Short will probably come up with some precedence in respect of this but so be it. In this particular circumstance where we do have some very actively debated issues before the parliament to come in with regulations like this, regulations which would subvert legislation which has been scrutinised by the Senate at the moment, is for us a very bad approach to take. For those reasons, I have moved this motion to disallow regulations Nos 7 and 8 of the migration regulations as contained in statutory rules 1996 No. 75 and made under the Migration Act 1958.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak very briefly to this in response, without generating a debate. I do not think either side of the chamber wants that. I want to make some points that are important. I think the opposition's action in relation to this is certainly <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> misguided. Whether it is based on a misunderstanding or whether it is a deliberate exercise to waste the Senate's time and to try to hoodwink senators as to the true meaning of all of this I am not too sure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The motion is based upon a misguided view of the opposition that the government has some sort of secret agenda in this area. Frankly, I find it extremely disappointing and hypocritical that someone like Senator Bolkus, who as a former minister for immigration should be expected to have some idea of administration in this area, cannot either understand the issue or alternatively he just wants to stop the Senate from getting on to important issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope Senator Bolkus will listen to this because, while I, naturally, differed from him on some issues when he was minister for immigration and I was the shadow minister, I think I can say with some pride that the then opposition worked to cooperate in this key area of national policy and administration. I know that the same constructive and responsible approach was taken by the present minister, Mr Ruddock, when he was the shadow minister. We worked to ensure bipartisanship. We understood that in this area the government of the day had a right and responsibility to govern. Whilst we properly acted to scrutinise decisions, our approach was positive. How things seemed to have changed in the last six short months since Labor went into opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The regulations that the opposition has taken such exception to are, quite simply, routine, machinery provisions. They are nothing more and nothing less. They relate to the assurance of support scheme. An assurance of support is a legal commitment by the assurer to repay the Australian government certain welfare benefits if paid to the migrant during the migrant's first two years in Australia. The allowances and benefits in question are established under social security legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Bolkus should know, from time to time the names of allowances or benefits change or new ones are added and so on. The regulation in question is merely designed to simplify cross&hyphen;referencing between social <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3217"> security legislation and the migration legislation scheme&mdash;nothing more, nothing less. There is no hidden agenda in this whatsoever. Instead of the migration regulations needing to be amended every time the names of relevant social security allowances change, the regulations provide for the change to be recognised by gazette notice. It is very simple. I cannot see what the opposition's problem is with that idea.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality of that situation is that the regulations Labor bequeathed us contained all the relevant social security legislation allowances bar one new one. That was the mature age allowance. The suggestion that the gazettal notice system could be used by stealth to introduce a whole raft of additional allowances for the purpose of the AOS scheme is just nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition was, after all, in government when the current Migration Act was substantially revised in 1989 and 1994 and when the present migration regulations were made in 1994. When in government, they clearly understood the need from time to time for simplicity in administration. The use of gazette notices is sanctioned in no less than 14 sections of the act and on 68 occasions in the regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We on this side understand the need for the detail to be provided in complex legislation by mechanisms such as gazette notice and I am sure, really, that the opposition does as well. Indeed, the previous government, the now opposition, thought that issues as important as placing limits on the number of visas to be issued in particular classes each year, as important as setting the pass marks for migrants to qualify for entry or even specifying foreign currency levels of application fees, were appropriate for notification by way of gazette notice. We agreed because we understood the need for quick and efficient means of administering complex issues. It seems that the experience of the last 13 years has now been washed away by Labor now in opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition is suggesting that the regulation is some devious way of the government achieving the measures contained in the legislation proposing a two-year waiting <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> period for social security benefits. We, of course, remain committed to that legislation, which was clearly explained before the election. But the reality is that the AOS scheme has been with us for many years. It will need to continue to exist for persons who arrive before the two-year waiting period legislation comes into effect. The need for AOSs, which require an explicit acknowledgment by the assurer of their responsibilities to provide support for the new migrant, will be addressed in due course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue we are dealing with at the moment has nothing to do with policy at all. It is, as I said, a routine, machinery provision. It is one that the previous government, now in opposition, adopted on various occasions in the past. We supported them in the interests of administrative efficiency. It is very regrettable, I must say, that Labor has now changed its attitude on this for what can only be hypocritical, cynical reasons. I really cannot understand any rationale for it. For that reason, we are strongly opposed to the disallowance motion.</PARA></SPEECH>

In fact, the minister would have us believe that `it is a routine, machinery <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3218"> provision'. The minister would have us believe that it is in fact a way of bringing in some kind of administrative efficiency&mdash;a way, I guess, in future that regulatory amendments may be attended to through ministerial discretion, by the stroke of an administrative pen. But if we look a little closer, we see an attempt by the minister to remove the scrutiny of the Senate with regard to migration regulations and replace it merely with a tabling in the Commonwealth <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS>. I think that is an undesirable and undemocratic state of affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If these regulations had been tabled in the Senate in any portfolio other than the immigration and ethnic affairs portfolio, we would perhaps think that they were innocuous measures, but I think a simple review reveals that this is not the case. In regard to immigration, we have only to look at the policies, not simply the process, of this government since it has come into office to see that what the minister is after is unfettered discretion&mdash;unfettered discretion over a broad range of policy areas in his portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think an example of this blatant disregard for the rule of law was the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996, which has been, of course, a source of attack for the government since it came into office.</PARA>

While the Democrats fundamentally disagree with the idea that economic rationalism should drive the immigration portfolio, we acknowledge that the minister, Mr Ruddock, has the prerogative to pursue those policies if he so desires.

<STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(10.11 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At close of play last night I was expressing my deep concern about the ATSIC bill's timing, about the bill's intent and about how changes had been altered yesterday without any consultation with those people who are mightily affected by the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3219"> changes that are occurring. I was expressing my concern about changing the paradigms of an election. Today, in fact, is the last day for nominations. I believe nominations close at 5 p.m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The nature of the election would be such that&mdash;and I am hoping that Minister Herron will clarify this in the committee stage&mdash;those people involved in nominating for an election would have had some information given to them about the nature of the council and the organisation for which they were nominating. It would be very interesting for the minister to clarify exactly what information would have been given to people about the nature of the organisation for which they were nominating, whether this information referred to the structure of ATSIC in anticipation of a change in legislation or whether this information related to the structure of the organisation as it exists. In fact, the legislation had not changed at the time the nominations opened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, in fact, that would be a very odd situation. I cannot imagine that in an Australian government election the electoral boundaries or the numbers of elected representatives would be changed after people had lodged their nominations. In  fact, that would be changing the rules after nominations had closed. I would think that would be a very odd situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the committee stage I will be keen to ask the minister questions such as: if this bill were to be shoved through now in order to change the nature of what people are electing in the ATSIC elections, what will be the cost of an ATSIC election and what might it cost either ATSIC or the Australian public to redo the election if there is a significant challenge to the election?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned last night as my time ran out that one of the significant changes in this bill was the government's proposal to give the minister power to appoint an administrator. I know that is part of yesterday morning's deal, but I would like to point out very carefully that, if the deal had not been brokered, the bill obviously still would not have gone anywhere and, in fact, we still would not have had an administrator in the bill and in legislation. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what have we gained? We will have put through a bill which has detrimental impacts, I believe, on self-determination. So what, in fact, has been gained by brokering the deal? That administrator still would not have been in existence because there was no legislation to allow that administrator to be in existence. What have we actually gained?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The appointment of an administrator would mean that the commission would not meet; that the commissioners would not be paid, whether or not they were in any way involved in the matters which led to the appointment of the administrator; and that any delegated powers of the commission may be revoked, thus possibly leading to downstream functions being stopped and so on. That smacked of the most blatant paternalism imaginable. Where else would we find such a power? It is certainly not okay to put such powers in the ATSIC Act because you can easily sell the idea in the community under the accountability mantra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what is happening at the moment. We are turning our back on self&hyphen;determination. We still, obviously, have to see what happens in the bill. There was information about what was part of yesterday's deal but, if the deal had not happened, we would not still have had an administrator, because the bill had not gone anywhere. I believe the original bill got taken off the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> in the House of Representatives. We did not have a bill; we did not have an administrator. Therefore, what have we gained except some other parts where we are moving further away from Aboriginal self&hyphen;determination? We are all responsible if we have been part of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must acknowledge that the minister has said he did not envisage these powers of appointing an administrator being used. But I think the whole principle of inserting them in the first place was coercive, threatening and an insult to the organisation. That is why we did not and do not support it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, we do not support the measures that are introduced by this bill. The Greens (WA) cannot support the bill in its present form. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did people think they were nominating for? What did those people nominating for the ATSIC elections believe they were nominating for? What was the basis of that belief? Can the minister provide any documentation to this chamber as to what nominees were advised they were nominating for? What would be the structure and basis of their organisation? It is my belief that the nature of people's nominations may have been affected by what they thought the nature of the organisation was. The size of the groups, the nature of the administration and so on may well affect people's desire or lack of desire to nominate for any organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I mentioned in my second reading contribution, it would be very odd indeed if, in an Australian election, electoral boundaries or numbers of senators, for instance, were changed after nominations were closed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand what the minister is referring to, section 102, to which I drew his attention yesterday. In fact, that is not what I was asking. Yesterday I expressed my concern that there was in fact a change of criteria for eligibility within the bill which <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3223"> people could well say would be misleading if one were to nominate and after the close of nominations find out that one either was no longer eligible or, perhaps the reverse, did not nominate because they thought someone else was eligible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That would mean there are changes to the bill. The bill was announced and it was assumed it would pass in whatever form&mdash;and who knows what kind of form would come out of the Senate in the normal democratic process. There are a number of changes to the bill. There are changes that the government is making. There are changes that, obviously, the Greens would like to make. I cannot speak for other parties here; perhaps they are all very happy with everything that is going on. But it is strange to assume in any event that any of these changes will not occur, that there might not be an amendment to the bill which would change eligibility criteria and the nature of the organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No matter what is said here, the nature of the organisation will change once this bill gets royal assent. That was not there. Before the bill got royal assent, it did not exist in legislation. It will exist if the bill goes through to royal assent. It did not exist before that time. So the actual organisation will have changed no matter what was in a bill that did not go anywhere&mdash;it went to the House of Representatives and did not go anywhere after the Senate changed it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is we are dealing with changes to a bill. We are dealing with a process in the Senate. I would like to say that there is never any total guarantee that a government or anybody else has control of the outcome, and we are dealing with an anomalous situation relating to an election for which nominations will close at 5 p.m. today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am challenging you on this: is this not a strange and odd thing, are there not changes that were not in legislation yesterday and could this process by which the Senate is meant to debate a bill in fact result in a number of changes whether you have announced them or not?

I assured her that if I learned there was any problem with that in respect of the possibility of a legal challenge, then I would be happy to withdraw it. I asked ATSIC to give further consideration to the implications of the amendment proposed to paragraph 102 (1)(c), item 28, of the ATSIC Act. I can confirm that it is possible, in theory, that the election of a person who is a director, has a controlling interest in a body corporate or is a consultant to the commission or TSRA, might be challenged by an unsuccessful candidate. Although the situation is probably unlikely to eventuate, the government is prepared to withdraw the proposed amendment to paragraph 102 of the bill to obviate that. Given that that is withdrawn, ATSIC does not envisage any possible legal challenge in any way if the bill is passed with that amendment removed.</PARA></TALK.START>

ATSIC does indeed have the responsibility, as the minister says, within <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> its budget to pay for the election. The point that Senator Brown, with respect, is making is that this is in a situation where the ATSIC budget has already been seriously reduced. In real terms for the ATSIC commissioners it is not an across-the-board reduction of 11 per cent, as serious as that is, because the government has effectively removed two-thirds of the entire budget of ATSIC from the decision making of its commissioners. I might add in passing that the view of the opposition and my own strong personal view is that it is an iniquitous position to put ATSIC in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I welcome the government's agreement to remove some of the more obnoxious provisions, such as the appointment of an administrator. In real terms, however, ATSIC is but a shell of its former self. The shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs has rightly welcomed the government's agreement to withdraw what we found profoundly objectionable, that is, the appointment of an administrator to replace the entire board. But it should be noted in respect of the point that Senator Brown is making that effectively two-thirds of the organisation's entire budget has already been removed from the purview of the board of ATSIC. Therefore, in terms of real decision making and independence of that decision making, the majority of it has already been removed from the organisation by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point Senator Brown is making is that therefore ATSIC, the board of commissioners, effectively is only taking decisions in respect of one-third of its budget, and that is having to do the dirty work of handing out cuts of in excess of 30 per cent across the board to those areas where it is still left with any discretion.</PARA>

Yes, it is the responsibility of the minister to provide the information, but in the committee of the whole we have a practice which means that we are able to ask each other to explain the point of what it is that we are pursuing. That is the way the committee of the whole operates. While you are right to say that the minister should provide information, Senator Collins is equally right, under our rules, to ask Senator Margetts if she could clarify what it is that she is getting to.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, indeed. The point of my line of questioning was to find out whether in fact the statement by the minister is correct, that people would have known what the basis of the election was because there had been a discussion, an inquiry and papers put out about potential changes. I am trying to get to the veracity of whether people would have known what the basis of this election was and what the official information is actually telling them about this election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3231"> We have nothing, except the minister saying, `They would have known because we had an inquiry.' We have inquiries about many things but I can tell you that until a decision or legislation has been passed there is no certainty that that is the decision. The minister is suggesting that groups&mdash;candidates, electors and interested people&mdash;would have known what the election was about and what the structure and basis of the organisa tion was about because there had been a discussion about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I was trying to find out was the gap between what that discussion was all about and what any official information is that has been sent out to communities. If this information can be made available during the course of the committee, I will be happy to table it or I would be very happy if the minister could table it. I have given the page numbers. Perhaps through the parliamentary library or some way we can put this information on the floor to be tabled or to be put in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of information that has been distributed, I have checked with ATSIC and ATSIC said that the only information they have put out is a pamphlet saying: `Why participate in the election?'

What the new bill is proposing to do is not implement what was about to happen, which was the election of the chair of ATSIC, and maintain the appointment. So that is a change. When we get down to the other provisions of this existing bill, when we get down to the number of regional councils, the number of regional councillors and wards, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3232"> that is where I think we need some clarification.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Greens (WA) certainly have a severe problem with amendments 2 and 3, which allow the minister to appoint councillors. If there is nothing in the bill which sets out the basis of this appointment then, theoretically, the minister can decide how that will happen. Whether or not he chooses to do it by the next on the list or any other means certainly leaves a rather odd situation in terms of self-determination, if that is in indeed what ATSIC is meant to be about. So we would strongly oppose that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It just might be useful to explain why this amendment has eventuated. When we debated this last time and we talked about a reduction in the number of regional councillors, the recommendation to do that came from a review conducted by ATSIC. So we are not bypassing ATSIC consideration of this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Senate committee hearing, several regional councillors said, `We understand why we want this to happen, but it has a problem in that, because of the distribution of population in each ward, there will be some pockets of communities who are small in number who may be unrepresented.' At the time, as I recall, the Senate said, `We can appreciate the principle of the reduction in number and we take ATSIC's advice on board, but we are still uneasy about this lack of representation in certain areas.' This proposal is meant to address that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I think is missing from it is the finer detail, which would be: are you going to look at the list of nominees, those who put themselves up for election to the council, as a starting point, or are you going to take the advice of the regional council of that whole area, or are you going to simply ask the board of commissioners to talk to you?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It would give us all a say. But in general terms&mdash;and I would `fess up immediately that the difference in approach is caused by the fact that I, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> having been in government and having been a minister for seven years, think ministers should be properly accountable&mdash;knowing the processes of the Senate and knowing the extraordinary reasons why these directions should be issued in the first place, we are not minded to support this particular amendment although we have great sympathy with it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason that we have great sympathy with it&mdash;this is a matter of public record, but it should be put down again on the public record&mdash;is that I profoundly and strongly believe the ministerial direction which was issued for the first time earlier this year was iniquitous, was absolutely without justification. I also believe, rightly or wrongly, that the minister was nothing but a pawn in this arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that he himself did not take to cabinet such a proposition, in terms of freezing the entire disbursements of ATSIC causing the most horrendous repercussions in Aboriginal communities. He then had the ignominious task&mdash;it was ignominious; and, having sat over there, I know just exactly how ignominious it must have been&mdash;to be forced to come into the Senate and reissue an amended direction effectively negating the effect of his first direction because of the mess that that had caused.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Margetts, the reason I raise that point is that without the direction&mdash;this is why we will not be supporting it&mdash;being made a disallowable instrument, I thought the Senate on that occasion, and the opportunities it gave us to raise the problems caused by minister's directions, did make him properly accountable at the end of the day and it did it in a fairly expeditious manner. The evidence is all there in the Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. The minister was forced at the end of the day to reissue his direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In conclusion, I want to make a point about this matter  that I will make again in this debate, without apology, before we leave here today&mdash;that is, why this action was outrageous. I am not letting the minister off the hook. He is here to represent the government and he acknowledges that. It was a government action that was taken. I know who beat him up in cabinet and who took it. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3242"> It is the government that I have a problem with.

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator BOB COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is the appropriate comparison, I think, Senator Kernot, because the amounts of public money involved are very similar. This report was tabled in the parliament only a very short time ago. It makes very interesting reading. As the former primary industries minister, it was a scheme that I had some passing interest in although it was administered by the Customs Service. This Audit Office report reveals that this scheme&mdash;as supportable, in my opinion, as it is&mdash;is losing, conservatively, something like $40 million a year in rip-offs and rorts. The report itself makes the point that this is a conservative figure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government itself has placed a far higher figure on it. They expect to get savings&mdash;as they are referred to&mdash;of $400 million from this scheme over the next four years in fixing the rorts. That is in the budget papers. The government clearly agrees with the audit office that the $30 million to $40 million figure is indeed a conservative figure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> We had a ministerial direction issued to ATSIC freezing all of its disbursements&mdash;all of them. Every single organisation in Australia funded by ATSIC was considered guilty until proven innocent on the basis&mdash;Senator Kernot would recall it only too well&mdash;and on the minister's own admissions to a Senate committee, that the government had got spooked by some nasty publicity on television and by the statements made in public by people like Pauline Hanson.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister admitted to a Senate committee that part of the reason for the issuing of that direction&mdash;freezing ATSIC's funds&mdash;was because of statements made by people like Pauline Hanson and the publicity on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program about the Redfern Legal Aid Service, which I can tell you I will be happy to come down on like a tonne of bricks at the appropriate opportunity in the Senate as much as anyone will be. That was the basis for freezing the entire funds of ATSIC, an Aboriginal organisation. This audit report identifies $40 million in rorts from the scheme. The government itself has put the figure in the budget papers at $100 million that they expect to get back in eliminating those rorts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Would anyone have seriously suggested, on the basis of this report which was tabled in the Senate recently, that the minister responsible for customs would have issued a direction to the administrators of this scheme freezing every single disbursement to every Australian farmer and miner&mdash;the recipients of this benefit&mdash;as a result of these rorts which far outweigh anything that ATSIC, on its worst day, has ever been accused of doing? Of course, they did not. As I said <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3243"> publicly at the time, it would have been absurd of anyone to have suggested that they should have done so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In cabinet that day&mdash;and I have no doubt that it was not in the submission which the minister took to cabinet&mdash;the government took this outrageous decision which caused the most horrendous dislocation to employment programs, to the provision of water supplies and sewage services in tiny Aboriginal communities all across Australia with horrendous health problems and forced the minister, at the end of the day, into the ignominious position in the Senate of rescinding his original direction and issuing a new one which completely negated the first.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You may object, Minister, but I do not think it is an invalid comparison to make in the chamber, and I might give it a passing reference again in the appropriate amendment that is to be moved by me shortly. The way in which miners and primary producers were treated by this government, and the way in which the Aboriginal people of Australia were treated by this government on exactly the same grounds, stands in stark contrast.</PARA></SPEECH>

One does wonder from time to time with the debates we have had in here over the past three or four years. The way we held the minister to account last time was via a censure motion. I think this is a better mechanism for providing for permanent debate. You cannot always rely on the suspension of standing orders to bring on a censure debate in order to make the points that we are able to make in debate. We saw what happened as a result of the issuing of that general direction. It came out of the blue.

<PARA>The amendments all relate to removing references to prison penalties within the act and substitution of the appropriate penalty units. These are the same amendments moved by my former colleague Christabel Chamarette in relation to this same bill in June this year. There is no diminution in the range of discretion that is given, but there is a principle being applied. As many senators would be well aware, this is consistent with the campaign that my former colleague con <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> ducted in relation to social security and other bills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason that I am moving this amendment is to apply the principle that prison should be a penalty of last resort and that our commitment to that principle should not be simply nominal. In particular, I believe we have a case in point that the offences here are serious ones. There is no question about that. The question as to what is the most appropriate penalty can be answered with almost complete certainty that prison should not be used as a first resort, which is what is implied, and that has been stated in this way in the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should be up to the court to determine the appropriate penalties. To have penalty units means there is a range of sanctions and penalties the court can apply. We should be particularly concerned about this when discussing ATSIC bills because recommendation No. 92 of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody strongly urges that imprisonment be applied only as a penalty of last resort.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe we need to have a much stronger response in the area of Aboriginal over&hyphen;representation in prison. We need to look at the way in which prison is used in a coercive or threatening way if we are going to keep putting it through as a deterrent effect, and criminologists know that that is not the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe it would be beneficial to remove the reference to imprisonment and put the penalty unit's equivalent in support of that principle, that we should not act by implying prison has some kind of magic value by being mentioned in the act. We should certainly be supporting the idea that the penalty should fit the crime and the offence and that it should be left up to the appropriate court determination. That is why I urge the Senate to support these amendments.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In respect of all the Greens amendments which relate to penalties&mdash;that is, amendments 3 to 7&mdash;we will be supporting amendments 3, 6 and 7, but opposing amendments 4 and 5. The reason we are opposing amendments 4 and 5 is that, in respect of these offences, the effect of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3245"> Greens amendments is to remove any option of imprisonment, which we do not think, in respect of these particular offences, is warranted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to amendment 3, we agree that is not a problem&mdash;penalty units rather than imprisonment. Committee members would recall that, effectively, we defined this the last time this was debated when there was some confusion about whether penalty units could in fact be interpreted as prison terms. That was quite definitively ruled out. So the effect of the Greens amendments 4 and 5 is to remove any imprisonment option, which we do not think is appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, in respect of schedule 1, item 50, page 27, and schedule 1, item 52, page 28&mdash;and I apologise to the committee for this late notice, but the paper is being prepared now&mdash;we will be moving our own amendments which would add to the existing provisions which only provide an imprisonment penalty. They will be in respect of Greens amendment 4 to add the option of 100 penalty units in schedule 1, item 50, page 27 and amendment 5 to add 10 penalty units in schedule 1, item 52, page 28.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I apologise to the committee for this oversight, but these are in fact the same amendments that we moved in the House of Representatives to these provisions. It is not, with respect, too difficult to understand. As I say, we are supporting three of these Green amendments, but the problem with amendments 4 and 5 is that we do believe an option of imprisonment or penalty units is desirable in this case.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I could just explain the gravity of the offence we are talking about. I am quite happy to go to the principal act if you want me to, but that is just wasting time.

We think it is appropriate for a court to have the option of imprisonment as well, either/or, which is why the Greens amendments are not acceptable to us.

<PARA>These amendments all relate to the removal of the appointment of a commission administrator and a Torres Strait administrator. I think that I have adequately canvassed why we find this to be iniquitous. The government has agreed to these amendments. As far as the opposition is concerned, they were the most offensive of the proposed changes to ATSIC and were non-negotiable in respect of any of the compromises that have been reached, not for the accommodation of the government but for the good management of ATSIC. This one was utterly non-negotiable. I am pleased that the government has agreed to support it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I canvass again that I believe that any reasonable person&mdash;I have no doubt that this will be the view of history&mdash;who actually bothers to examine the record of this entire affair will agree that the entire package of proposals together, including special audit, freezing of funds and appointment of an administrator, was an absolutely inexcusable over&hyphen;reaction, probably poll driven, by the government in respect of an  Aboriginal organisation. It was taken uniquely in respect of that organisation and not even contemplated in respect of any other organisation dispersing similar funds and having, I would respectfully suggest on the basis of audit advice, far greater problems than ATSIC has on its worst day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will always be problems with the accountability and disbursement of moneys in the order of $1 billion. But it should be pointed out once again that a reasonable person should also examine the breakup of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3247"> that $1 billion. The minister referred to it in debate again today. It is $1 billion of public money. Fully one-third of that $1 billion goes to paying wages under CDEP. These are payments in respect of Aboriginal people who uniquely in Australia have elected to work for their social security benefits, something they do not have to do. To their enormous credit, entire communities do this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Frankly, I think it would be very difficult to find any other isolated communities in Australia where you would get consensus on this issue to the extent you can in an Aboriginal community. Entire communities, for the community benefit, have agreed to forgo their legal entitlements under Australian law to collect unemployment benefits, which would in any case have to be dispersed by the government, and have elected to engage in community development employment programs for the benefit of the community. That is one-third of ATSIC's budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An additional one&hyphen;third of the budget is taken up simply with the provision of essential services such as sewerage supplies and water supplies. These are services which every other isolated community in Australia&mdash;and there are many of them&mdash;take for granted, Aboriginal or non&hyphen;Aboriginal. That is two&hyphen;thirds of the billion dollar ATSIC budget. As I have said before in respect of the quarantine that has now been imposed on that budget, it effectively removes two&hyphen;thirds of the ATSIC budget from the operations of its commission. In that sense, it effectively makes something of a shell of the organisation. I have said before, and it deserves repeating at least once more, that it effectively imposes on the commission the dirty work of imposing horrifically large cuts on the remaining one&hyphen;third of the ATSIC budget where they all fall: that is, on those programs that are absolutely essential in terms of the cultural enrichment and preservation of Aboriginal society, language and art, legal aid services and all the rest of it in Australia. It is horrendous, as far as the opposition is concerned, as is the government's entire performance on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> I am pleased that at least the government has agreed to remove this obnoxious provi sion. The reason I want to make that point is that, as significant a result as this is for ATSIC and for the Aboriginal people that it serves, it is a long way from being a satisfactory result as far as the opposition is concerned because of the entire shabby way in which the Aboriginal community of Australia and ATSIC have been treated in this matter.</PARA></SPEECH>

We imposed layer upon layer of accountability on that commission&mdash;required in the main by the opposition of the day&mdash;so we have a high degree of accountability on regional councils and on the regional councillors who make up the council.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3248"> I have always believed that this extra level that does not apply&mdash;this need for a special administrator which is not a requirement of any other comparable entity in this country&mdash;was done for the wrong reason. Senator Collins has canvassed his view of what may or may not have happened in a particular cabinet meeting and what the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) went in with and came out with. I think it is not an exaggeration to say that much of this was done in a knee&hyphen;jerk way because of misconception about public con cern over Aboriginal organisational accountability in general.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am delighted that, as part of the cross&hyphen;party consultation that has happened on the particular bill that we are discussing, the government has been willing to withdraw this proposal. It is this proposal, on top of the general direction, which led to that wider and misinformed public debate&mdash;characterised by the maiden speech of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) last night&mdash;and this climate of misinformation about Aboriginal advantage in this country. I really regret the context of this decision which said we needed to have a special administrator appointed. The context was that out there we have Aboriginal communities and organisations who cannot handle money or who are crooks or who are bludging off the Australian taxpayer and, therefore, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs has to have the right to bring in, over and above everything that we have set in place, yet another layer called the special administrator. It was ill conceived, it was politically motivated and it was the wrong thing to do. I am delighted that you are withdrawing it, and I commend you.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My concern throughout this process is when many people recognise that there are problems in a system which has been imposed from above. It seems to be a system which was almost, in a way, set up to fail. It needs to have a mechanism by which people can go back and assess how it is doing. People should be assessing how it is doing if the whole system of ATSIC and ATSIC elections and ATSIC representation is meant to be serving the interests of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, it seems to me most appropriate that, if there are problems in the system, then there needs to be some way by which you go back to the people who are being affected by that system to find out what is working and what is not working and how the system can change to meet the stated functions and the real needs of those communities it is meant to be serving. This cannot be done, in my opinion, as a result of a survey at the end of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> every three-year election to see how the elections went.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There needs to be, in my opinion and in the opinion of a number of people I have spoken to recently, a way of finding out from those people most affected what is working and what is not working. It would seem to me to require an independent, properly funded review that can take time to go into communities and allow communities to speak for themselves, to enable the traditional operations of decision making, especially in groups that do not necessarily get represented in all decisions that are made through the current system of ATSIC operation, such as women's groups, to take place. It would seem to me to be at least a two-phase process; firstly, to work out how to put such an inquiry together and, secondly, to provide sufficient resources and time for such a process to take place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is my intention as a result of the debate so far not to put an amendment at this stage because that would be pre-empting what communities want and how they might want such an inquiry or review to take place. It is my intention to contact as many groups as I can in the near future to get their ideas about how such an inquiry might take place. If we are serious as a Senate in dealing with the issues of provision of services in allowing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities to move towards a greater level of self-determination, then making decisions from the top is simply compounding the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that there are no simple answers to this but I do know that we have to spend a lot of time working out how we can go back and ask communities how they think they can have a say in how this process might be improved. It is the disempowerment that seems to be having a very great effect at the moment. As has been described to me in one particular instance, a small amount of money is provided to a group of ATSIC commissioners and they are told, `You must make a decision about where this small amount of money goes to.' So they talk, information is given, there are arguments from different groups, there is extra information and finally, through all of that process, a decision is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3250"> made. Then the minister can say, `No.' That seems to be not recognised in its level of disempowerment. Many decisions are being made at the moment. A lot of them are about land issues. The disbursement of funds, the level of community participation and decision making and the level of self-determination are all very important decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that, if governments decide or even if we as a Senate decide how things should be done, we are forgetting that we should be doing our best to allow some process of real self&hyphen;determination. As I say, it is my intention to write to groups, individuals and any interested people to find out what their ideas would be about how such a process could start, how it might be put together and how it might be effective in getting ideas about how this whole process could work better. There is no doubt that there are problems but it is my contention that we should be serious about finding out how we can make it better and not simply slash and burn from above to get some cheap political capital. That is the most distressing part of this whole venture today.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to respond to some of those comments because I do not think we should let them stand without saying what ATSIC does. Someone has to say what ATSIC does: ATSIC reviews. It does not sit back and think everything is working perfectly. It is required to review regularly. You may have a disagreement about the success of the manner in which it communicates with its communities. Many communities are critical of that and the lack of balance in the two&hyphen;way process. I think that is a legitimate concern. I do not think it is fair to say that ATSIC has not tried to address it, because it has.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been part of a joint committee which investigated, by travelling to many Aboriginal communities, the difficulties experienced by indigenous Australians in taking part in the electoral processes of this country. The recommendations from those committees have been followed through. Some of this has been made difficult because funding to indigenous representatives who facilitate the processes to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> involve indigenous Australians in various elections has also been cut.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In structural terms, I do not think it is necessary to keep saying that we have to have another review and another review. In my view, the systemic failure is this: we have hugely insufficient funds to redress the disadvantage of indigenous people in this country. The previous government, this government and a proportion of the Australian population support the kind of ceiling that is on funding for this matter. While ever that decision is there in terms of the level of resourcing, it then requires, through the regional council process, Aboriginal communities to bid against each other in the most odious way for a very small pool of funds, and so many of them are disappointed time after time. This leads to division within communities and between communities, and that is a problem. It is the structure that causes that to happen, and the lack of adequate resources exacerbates it. That is the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unless this Senate can appropriate so many more hundreds of millions of dollars for indigenous matters, I do not think a review can address what Senator Margetts's concerns encapsulate. We have to acknowledge that there is a level of self&hyphen;determination that was not there before in the control of the regional councils over the budget. My problem is that the budget is woefully inadequate.</PARA></SPEECH>

What I said was that, if the communities are concerned about the way ATSIC is operating, their concerns will not assuaged by a review by ATSIC. In the end, we must be willing to set up some process by which the communities feel that they are being brought into the process. As I say, this is not an easy thing to do. I admit that. But I am hearing from the communities that an electoral review, an ATSIC review or even a Senate review is not meeting those needs of the community to be <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3251"> heard and to work out how things can work better. It is in ATSIC's best interest, I would think, that it has the confidence of the community that it represents. Whatever review takes place, it must take those views and needs into consideration. That is what I am suggesting. It is not a comment on ATSIC. It is a comment on what I believe needs to be done for the future to make sure that ATSIC actually achieves its potential, if it is capable of doing so.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night on the Jana Wendt <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Witness</EMPHASIS>  program an item was screened concerning the John Bertrand America's Cup research and development syndicate. The allegation was made that taxpayers had paid millions of dollars for a yacht race and that somehow I, who at the time was minister in charge of the industry portfolio, had participated in a cover&hyphen;up of this matter. I have been misrepresented previously on this matter and to my certain knowledge so has Mr Bertrand, and he may well take his own action.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> For my explanation I will give the facts of the matter. No cover&hyphen;up of any sort occurred. It is true that there was some controversy in the tax concession committee of the Industry Research and Development Board, the committee that approves syndication, and that related to the nature of the reports the syndicate had given and the timing of the arrival of those reports. It was sorted out when Price Waterhouse was appointed by the Bertrand syndicate to take care of that business for it. It then complied. The tax concession committee voted to grant recognition to the Bertrand syndicate and registered it as a proper syndi cate, and the Industry Research and Development Board endorsed that decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to my role in this, I had none. The reason is quite obvious. The IR&amp;D board and the tax concession committee are statutorily independent of the government and therefore of the minister. I had no role in directing their determination of any of the affairs before them. That is their obligation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The parallel situation is that of the Treasurer and the tax commissioner. The Treasurer cannot direct the tax commissioner in the conduct of his collection of tax. In a parallel situation, at that time I could not&mdash;and absolutely rightly, in my view&mdash;direct this board to take action which could confer a monetary reward on a particular company. And I did not. If I had done&mdash;the implication of last night's program was that I should have&mdash;I would have acted improperly and ought to have been dealt with accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further allegation in this program was that I had received a letter from the board asking me to act, and that has been repeated on a number of occasions. The fact is that I did not. The fact is that some members of the tax concession panel wrote to me asking me to take sides in an issue that the panel were dealing with. As I have said before, this is a statutorily independent body and it is entirely inappropriate for a minister to do that. And I did not do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee itself never wrote to me on this matter, and the committee itself, as I have said, fully endorsed the syndicate as an appropriate syndicate. Not only did they do that, but the tax commissioner, who in matters of taxation has the final say and does not delegate his powers, also granted the concession to this body.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further misrepresentation concerns remarks by me that I had appointed former Commissioner of Taxation and distinguished Australian ambassador to the OECD, Mr Trevor Boucher, to chair the tax concession committee, which I had done, and Mr Boucher's resignation. The nature of the last report was to infer that he had resigned in relation to the matters that were the subject of the report&mdash;i.e. the syndicate. I am advised that Mr Boucher resigned because this <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3252"> government cancelled syndication, thus removing the task that he had to do. He had no purpose in fulfilling that position, and he resigned for that reason.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further implication is that public servant Mr Alan Evans had to be shifted as a consequence of this. I am advised that the correct circumstance was that, as a consequence of a change of government, a change of structure within the department flowing from the appointment of a new secretary to the department and a downsizing of staff numbers in the department meant a transfer of some officers. That was the reason for Mr Evans's change of occupation within the department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an example of misrepresentation. I would trust that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Witness</EMPHASIS> program would show the same responsibility that the Seven Network has shown in its news service in ensuring that corrections to the record have been made in the news reporting, which they have to this day done. I would hope that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Witness</EMPHASIS> program would follow suit and correct the record where it has misled the Australian community.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this lunchtime debate to speak about an issue on which I moved a motion earlier this week with regard to the paralympians. By any measure, the Australian performance at the Atlanta Paralympic Games was an awe&hyphen;inspiring success. It even elicited superlatives from the most jaded of sports writers, and no doubt pride from many, if not all, Australians as they were enthralled and watched the enormous achievements of those people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The score line of 42 gold, 37 silver and 27 bronze medals&mdash;the largest medal haul per capita of any nation in the world&mdash;cemented our status as the premier paralympic sporting nation. Medal tallies are not really a good measure of success, and they are a poor measure of the achievement of these athletes, because each one of them has overcome life&hyphen;transforming disabilities to do what they did.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For many of them, simply learning to cope with the disabilities that they have either had from birth or have acquired through fate has been a challenge and an achievement in itself. Just overcoming the challenges of the activities of daily living is an heroic achievement on their part.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To transcend their disabilities and go further, to become athletes of international renown, is truly an awe&hyphen;inspiring feat. Our paralympians, through their performance at Atlanta, remind us of the possibilities that arise when we challenge the limitations we face in life rather than living down to them. For many of us who complain about an ache here or a pain there or that something is pretty tough, we see what tough really is when we look at what they have achieved. They also remind us that we ought to judge people by what they can do rather than by what we think they can't do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to comment on the behaviour of the paralympian athletes. Their achievements also remind us of the ethics of sporting activity. In these days when we all too frequently see in other areas of sport bad sportsmanship&mdash;we see violence, we see drug taking, we see complaints&mdash;it is worth noting that the Australian contingent at the Paralympics had no dope positives, no arrests for poor behaviour and no accusations of poor sportsmanship. We did not hear any of those sorts of comments coming out of the Paralympics that we had coming out of the Olympics themselves or other sporting activities even within our own country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the contrary, the newspaper reports commented on our athletes' friendliness, their cooperative attitude, even in the face of some very difficult organisational mishaps. So we should commend the paralympians not only on their performance as representatives of our nation but also on their performance in demonstrating the ethics of sport and what good sportsmanship is about. I think we can say that few countries have ever been so ably or well represented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Paralympics have become truly an international event. To put our athletes' performances in perspective, we should consider some facts about the scope of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3253"> Paralympic games. The Paralympic games were the world's second largest sporting event. They were bigger than the World Series, the Super Bowl and the World Cup in terms of scope, number of participants and events. Over 110 nations were represented by some 3,500 athletes with disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia was represented by 162 athletes, competing in track and field, swimming, cycling, basketball, rugby, shooting, goalball, lawn bowls, equestrian, powerlifting, tennis and judo, to name some of them. The competitors were elite athletes with physical, visual or mental impairments, representing four international federations&mdash;the blind, paraplegics and quadriplegics, people with cerebral palsy, amputees and others. In this context, the achievements of individual athletes stand out even more profoundly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By including some of them I will leave some of them out, and for that I am sorry. But as a Victorian I have particular pride in the achievements of our wheelchair racers&mdash;John Lindsay and Lachlan Jones. Born with spina bifida, John Lindsay, the `wheelchair whiz', set a new world record in the 100 metres. To understand the magnitude of his achievements it is worth reflecting on a report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 23 August, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When John Lindsay first started racing the 100 metres, it was in a standard day chair and it took him two minutes to cover the distance. On Wednesday 21 August, the Victorian did it in 15.22 second, and won a Paralympic Gold medal.</PARA>
<PARA>His words on that day, when asked about his gruelling training regime and its inherent risks, were simple and profound&mdash;he said, `You get hurt, you get up, you go on.' Maybe former Senator Gareth Evans ought to take a lesson out of his book&mdash;you get hurt, you get up, you go on. He is suffering from a bit of relevance deprivation syndrome. Victorian Lachlan Jones, who has cerebral palsy, also set a world record in winning his race in the prestigious men's 100 metre wheelchair sprint.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another highlight of the games was the achievements of Perth athlete Kingsley Bugarin. Bugarin, a visually impaired veteran of three Paralympics, had never won a medal <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in his chosen sport of swimming. He smashed the 12&hyphen;year&hyphen;old record of the USA's John Morgan in the men's individual medley B2 by 1.5 seconds, improving his own personal best by an incredible seven seconds. We saw parts of seconds being shaved off in the Olympics but here we see seven seconds slashed off his record. I think that ought to be noted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another memorable event was the win of Queenslander Brian Harvey, who has cerebral palsy, in the men's javelin. After his gold medal winning throw of 34.7 metres, Harvey was apparently disappointed with his performance. He said, `It's not good enough. It's never good enough.' That is another message that maybe we, as politicians in this place, ought to take. The message they have given us is: when you get hurt, you get up, you go on and when you have achieved you say, `It's not good enough. It's never good enough.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Harvey's comments illustrate that the ideal of striving towards one's personal best is not an anachronism confined to manipulative advertising, as we have seen in some of the advertisements lately; it is alive and well in the paralympian team&mdash;striving to do one's best. After the commercialism of the Atlanta Olympics, I for one found it refreshing to hear that ideals of sportsmanship and achievement are still espoused by Australian athletes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Paralympics are a rallying point for the thousands of Australians with disabilities. Each individual achievement becomes a focus for thousands of other individual achievements. No doubt for many young people with disabilities the sorts of role models they saw in our paralympians will spur them on and give them encouragement to achieve. Hopefully each individual paralympic achievement sparks another person coping with the disability to reach beyond their limitations and to pursue a dream of representing their country in international competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I could go on about the achievements of Atlanta&mdash;the achievements of the Australian team co&hyphen;captain Priya Cooper, the games' most prolific medallist, winning six gold medals, a silver and bronze in the pool, or Gemma Dashwood collapsing on the pool deck after winning a silver medal in her first event. But I guess one of the finest moments <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3254"> occurred when the paralympians returned home and they were going through the streets of Sydney in the ticker tape parade. One could not help but be inspired by seeing Victorian basketballers Stuart and Paula Ewin&mdash;Stuart is a paraplegic and Paula is an amputee&mdash;wheeling their way up George Street with their two-year-old son James along for the ride.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that we could see the true spirit of the Paralympics&mdash;dignity, courage and strength, combined with the active and loving support of friends, family, sponsors and all those in the community who have donated and worked to made it possible for those paralympians to achieve their goal and to represent Australia so wonderfully in Atlanta. I would like to congratulate our paralympians once again on their achievements. Like all of us, I look forward to watching them once again surpass all their goals and expectations in Sydney 2000. I am sure they will do us proud.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon I want to return to Wanneroo, which is a great place to live, and raise a matter that I raised some three weeks ago at the same time in this chamber. At that time I predicted that the pending royal commission interim report into the city of Wanneroo would be a whitewash. I take no joy in saying that my predictions were entirely accurate. Indeed, the commission report itself has a white cover on it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not the only person who has said that it would be a whitewash. I am not the only person who has said, since the report has come down, that it is indeed a whitewash. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian </EMPHASIS>on Thursday, 5 September, Dr Sandra Egger, an associate professor of law at the University of New South Wales and a member of the New South Wales Police Board, said the same thing as I said, only she used much more explicit language than I used.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take no joy in the fact because I have seen what has happened with the corruption that has been happening in the city of Wanneroo for a long period. The corruption involves <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> very senior officials and officers of the Liberal Party of Australia, Western Australia Branch. It has also involved Liberal Party members of parliament, some of whom remain under investigation, so I will not dwell on that or interfere with police investigations. We all know that assertions have been made by a number of individuals, some of whom have been members of my party, the Labor Party. Others who have not been members of any political party at all have also made allegations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that Mr Wayne Bradshaw, once a Liberal Party candidate, has just been released from gaol. David King, a councillor from the city of Wanneroo, has also served his time in gaol and there are a few others who remain under investigation. My colleague the Liberal senator from Western Australia came into this place on 9 September and stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I say at the outset that the report cleared the names of the Hon. Cheryl Edwardes, the Minister for Family Services in Western Australia, and her husband . . . The findings of Royal Commissioner Davis show the allegations levelled at Mr and Mrs Edwardes to be totally unsubstantiated.</PARA>
<PARA>I want to read into the record the findings of Commissioner Davis, as stated in the interim report that was presented to the Western Australian parliament last week. Under 3.6.1 it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There were audio tapes recorded by the IAU on which the voice of Mrs Cheryl Edwardes could be heard. The tapes were erased on or about 5 June 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> No police officer holds or has ever held an audio tape on which could be heard the voice of Mrs Edwardes engaged in a discussion in which a sum of money was discussed in an improper context.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The fact that Mr McLeod was acquainted with Mr and Mrs Edwardes did not create a conflict of interest nor did it influence Mr McLeod in the conduct of his investigation into Mr Wayde Smith.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Smith is the Liberal MLA for the state seat of Wanneroo. The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The audio tapes recorded by the IAU in the course of its investigation into the affairs of Mr Wayde Smith, together with the monitoring sheets and most of the transcriptions, were properly erased and destroyed by Mr McLeod <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3255"> and members of his staff on 5 June 1991. None of the remaining transcription contains any reference to Mr or Mrs Edwardes.</PARA>
<PARA>I find that very strange. If you go back in the report to page 85, under 3.2.3, the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the request of Mrs Edwardes, and along with other members of the club&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the club being the Little Athletics Club at Greenwood&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr McLeod helped Mrs Edwardes with an election campaign which he recalls was in "the early eighties", around 1984. Some members handed out How to Vote cards but, as a police officer, Mr McLeod said he restricted himself to driving elderly voters to the polling booth.</PARA>
<PARA>It was very sloppy for the commissioner to record words and dates such as that. Mrs Edwardes stood first for the seat of Kingsley in the year 1988. She was elected to the parliament of Western Australia in early 1989, not the early 1980s, and most certainly and most decidedly not in 1984.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note that, even though Detective McLeod worked for her campaign and was investigating one of her colleagues, a member of parliament and a councillor in the city of Wanneroo, Royal Commissioner Davis dismisses it in the findings that he has brought down. Under 3.2.4, page 86, the commissioner says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It must be kept in mind that the investigation was not into the conduct or activities of Mr and Mrs Edwardes. The target of the investigation was Mr Smith. Mr and Mrs Edwardes were no more than associates of Mr Smith. Mr McLeod made known to his superior his acquaintance with Mrs Edwardes from the outset. Further, that relationship was tenuous. Mr McLeod said</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">". . . it didn't concern me. I knew there was a possibility of being in a position to perhaps charge any one of the people involved with an offence of corruption and I would not have shirked from that at all."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I accept Mr McLeod's evidence and conclude that his acquaintance with Mrs Edwardes had no impact on his conduct of the investigation.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the case whether or not there is a record of what has gone wrong and where corruption has happened in the local authority where I live in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr McLeod admitted before the commission that he destroyed tapes on which it was <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> alleged there were recordings of Mrs Edwardes's voice. The commissioner gave an indication of that under point 3.3.6 on page 95 of the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In summary, Mr McLeod said he decided in June 1991 to erase the tapes and destroy the transcripts and monitoring sheets for three reasons. First, because there was nothing on the tapes of an evidentiary value; secondly, to comply with the Listening Devices Act; and thirdly, because some of the material on the tapes and in the transcripts was, in his opinion, politically sensitive. Mr McLeod explained that "nothing of an evidentiary nature" meant to him nothing of a criminal nature. There is no doubt that evidence of the commission of an offence is all that should have been of interest to Mr McLeod. As to the second explanation, it is questionable that the tapes and transcripts should have been destroyed before the operation was terminated in October 1991.</PARA>
<PARA>The operation was still on the go, yet this detective destroyed evidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The great damage is that the commission has accepted this code of behaviour in Western Australia. The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Evidence that may appear innocuous at one point may fit into a pattern when seen in conjunction with evidence obtained later.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not accept that the Listening Devices Act required the erasure of the tapes and destruction of the paperwork until the operation was completed. Mr Ayton agreed that there was no statutory requirement to erase the tapes until the operation was completed.</PARA>
<PARA>I said in my opening remarks that it would give me no joy to read this. It certainly gives me no joy, because what I see here is the whole make&hyphen;up of law and order&mdash;not only in my state of Western Australia, but around Australia&mdash;being completely and utterly discredited by the processes that have gone on at the Davis royal commission in Perth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask honourable senators&mdash;indeed, others will do it, even if we don't&mdash;to consider for themselves the happenings in the Davis royal commission in Perth and the manner in which the commission has been conducted, and compare that with what is happening in New South Wales in the Wood royal commission. How is the Wood royal commission being conducted and how was and is the Davis royal commission conducted? I think you will find there are very stark differences indeed <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3256"> between them. Dr Egger, whom I quoted earlier in the article from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> on Thursday, September 5, has also drawn attention to this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a whole lot of other matters raised in the interim report which will undoubtedly be dealt with&mdash;perhaps in this place, perhaps in another forum. They will not be allowed to rest, or to be pushed under the carpet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The involvement of Richard Elliott, a special adviser to the Premier of Western Australia, has again been dismissed in this report. He was at a meeting at the instigation of the police commissioner to stop certain investigation that was going on. It is all on the public record and it is contained in the report, but time does not permit me to deal with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the report, I also want to raise another extremely disturbing aspect. As I indicated earlier, I spoke in this place on 21 August on the matter of Wanneroo. My colleague Senator Ellison, a Liberal senator from Western Australia, came in on the adjournment speech on 22 August 1996. He refuted some of the things that I had been reported to have said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> that same day, 22 August. The matter that I want to highlight and express grave concern about is this quote from Senator Ellison. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are those in Western Australia who are simply not happy with the interim report of the royal commission which cleared Cheryl Edwardes, the Minister for Family Services, and her husband of any wrongdoing whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA>I ask the Senate to take note of the dates. It was 22 August 1996 when Senator Ellison sat in this place and made that statement. I am quoting directly from the print which comes from the computer, and which is available here in Parliament House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The interim report of the royal commission into the City of Wanneroo was actually given to the Governor of Western Australia, and it was reported in all our media, because of that, on Friday, 30 August 1996. The report did not actually become public until it was tabled in the Western Australian state parliament on Tuesday, 3 September. I made the assertion <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that the corruption that has occurred&mdash;and that, hopefully, has been stamped out now in Wanneroo because there have been many investigations into it&mdash;reached right to the top of the Liberal Party in Western Australia. I hope that what Senator Ellison said, in his admission to the chamber on 22 August 1996, is not an indication that it has reached right to this place, because it brings the whole matter of law and order in my state of Western Australia&mdash;indeed, throughout Australia&mdash;into complete and utter disrepute when a royal commission's findings could reach the hands of a member of parliament who is not directly connected with the royal commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to raise another matter in the short time that is available to me. It is also a matter concerning the area in which I live. The issue has been the subject of much concern, not only in Western Australia and Wanneroo, but throughout Australia. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> of 5 June had a report entitled `Residents up in arms over towers'. That was referring to the Gold Coast city in Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Western Australia, the most recent proposals to construct towers have been in the areas of Warwick, which is in the federal seat of Cowan, and Mullaloo, which is in the seat of Moore. In both instances, there were proposals to construct towers in extremely close proximity to a school or a child&hyphen;care centre. Residents, parents and P&amp;Cs are up in arms about this, as the Gold Coast residents were, and a number of public meetings have been held and petitions completed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was asked by the Labor candidate for Joondalup, Dianne Guise, who is also president of the Western Australian Council for State Schools Organisations, to distribute and present to the parliament a petition calling on the Senate to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a) immediately commence a moratorium on the erection of mobile phone towers;</PARA>

<STATE> (Queensland)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(1.15 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last Wednesday, one of Australia's most important export industries released details of a comprehensive study it had commissioned into how it can ensure its future sustainability. The sugar industry was presented with a detailed environmental audit of its operations aimed at ensuring cane farming is not only economically viable, but also environmentally sustainable. It set out to establish a benchmark of environmental performance for use in evaluating the effect of future farming practices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At present the industry's economic viability is not a real concern. It has grown over the last 130 years to a point where it is now the nation's second most valuable agricultural crop, generating $2 billion of income each year. The industry is particularly valuable in my state of Queensland, where 95 per cent of the country's entire supplies are produced. Indeed, my home town of Ayr is virtually slap&hyphen;bang in the middle of the Burdekin canegrowing region, which accounts for 36 per cent of the state's sugar crop.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although, as these impressive figures show, the industry is building on its economic success, its peak representative body&mdash;Canegrowers&mdash;recognises that the industry must be ecologically sustainable. For this reason it commissioned an independent consultant, Gutteridge Haskins &amp; Davey, to perform this environmental audit. The audit was conducted over four months of field work. The double pronged project involved interviews with 180 industry stakeholders and the performance of 130 farm audits right along the 2,100 kilometres of the canegrowing coast of Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The audit was carried out at complete arm's length from the industry and from any pressure groups that might have been around, and in accordance with the strictest international standards. It looked at sensitive issues which need to be addressed to ensure the industry's <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> longevity. These included air emissions, land and water management, dangerous goods and chemical usage, and fertiliser management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were some general findings which the consultants believe should be seriously considered by the industry. A major need was found to exist for both greater industry education of stakeholders and consultation with them. Whilst the results are obviously the bottom line, the perception of the sugar industry's environmental achievements is sadly lacking, with more than 60 per cent of the stakeholders interviewed considering growers' environmental measures in need of improvement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report also found that a concerted education program was needed to show farmers the benefits of adopting green practices. This would promote strategies designed to improve their individual crops without impacting on the wider off&hyphen;farm environment. The audit team found that, in general, growers would willingly do the right thing, but often did not due to lack of appropriate information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Airborne emissions from industry practices were extensively evaluated by the report, with one of the single largest concerns raised during stakeholder interviews being that of cane firing. The seasonal burn&hyphen;offs are not only visible but also emotive, with many people&mdash;particularly those residing near farming lands&mdash;being concerned about the environmental effects of the practice and the subsequent black ash, or `snow' as it is called up our way, that firing introduces. I know that my wife and I, and other people like us who hang out the washing, are always concerned about that snow during the crushing season, although that is a pretty minor aspect of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, partly in response to community pressures, growers have commenced action to reduce this problem by switching to green cane harvesting in many parts of Queensland. Since 1982, the percentage of the Queensland crop harvested green has increased by two per cent to over 40 per cent. In North Queensland as many as 83 per cent of farmers cut their cane green. The report raises the possibility that in future all of Queensland's 6,300 cane farmers might harvest their entire crops in this fashion. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3258">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, coming from the Burdekin, as I do, I know that, in spite of the best intentions of the industry, there are special factors that exist in some regions, particularly the Burdekin, which will preclude this. One of the hurdles is that in the Burdekin particularly, which is very flat and dry and in which, as a result, irrigation is used extensively for the crops, the foliage or trash that would be produced by green harvesting would lie in irrigation drains and would block water supply to large areas of cane. A second hurdle is caused by the sheer size of the cane crop in the Burdekin district, which is amongst the largest and the heaviest in the world. The machines used to harvest green cane are not able to do so as efficiently with the heavy crops in the Burdekin as with the smaller crops in some other areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, recently, there were some reports about Weil's disease, from rats in the cane, which has surfaced because some of the cane crops are not being fired. That is something that really has to be looked at. Canegrowers are being encouraged to look at that and also to review aerial spraying techniques, which concern communities in canegrowing areas. These days, only a few districts practise aerial spraying. The damage that used to occur in years gone by to townsfolk and to their vegetable and fruit gardens is not quite as much in evidence. There have been a lot of advances made in that area in the past few years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The consultants also reviewed a number of concerns relating to management of farming lands, a key one being the continued expansion of farming lands. While expansion is currently economically beneficial, the audit confirmed that the desire to grow must be tempered by a balance with careful and responsible use of land. Interviews showed that conservationists believed that the government was not doing this and that it was too eager to expand beyond sustainable limits. The Queensland coalition government has announced a moratorium on expansion of one of the state's key sugar areas&mdash;the Burdekin River irrigation area. This shows that the current state government has a responsible approach to ensuring sustainable farming. It <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is an approach that could be looked at by other governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might say that, in last night's Queensland state budget, another $23 million was provided for capital works in water in the Burdekin River irrigation area to complete some capital works that need to be done. I should also mention that I am just a fraction concerned about the approach of the previous government to the expansion of cane lands in the upper Burdekin area. To my way of thinking, it did not allow sufficient corridors and reserves for animals. That was something that the Burdekin Shire Council, more than a decade ago, when I was actually on the Burdekin Shire Council, asked the government to consider in its expansion of sugar lands. I am a little bit disappointed that there does not seem to have been enough attention paid to that particular matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Soil erosion and expansion on to marginal lands that are not entirely suitable for canegrowing were also tagged by the audit as potential industry problems. The consultants recommended that growers maintain a property management plan and information detailing ongoing soil changes on their properties. At present this is largely not being done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The management of water and waste water in canegrowing activities was also causing some concern for industry stakeholders. Around 65 per cent of growers use some form of irrigation, and the consultants believed that the potential for water related environmental damage was a concern. The most significant problem appeared to be the effect of farm discharge on off&hyphen;farm waterways and associated land areas, including erosion and nutrient loading. At present there is a lack of solid data to quantify the suspected detrimental effects that unchecked emissions may have on waterways. The consultants recommended the industry establish a monitoring system of water quality in waterways and creeks to counter the negative perceptions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Farmers' use of hazardous goods and chemicals was also tagged as an area in this environmental report. In this regard, however, the report showed that growers have displayed sound practices which minimise environmental risks. A decreasing amount of chemical <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3259"> solutions is being used to control pests and diseases, and growers' knowledge of their application, management and storage was found to be excellent. I know, from my conversations and from living in a canegrowing community, that farmers have for many years had a very high appreciation of the dangers of uncontrolled use of chemicals in fertiliser and in pest control. The audit team found that there was no suggestion of excessive rates of fertiliser being used. Again, I know a lot of canegrowers are trying to grow their crops using natural enhancements to canegrowing rather than the application of chemical fertilisers. Past farming practices may not have had widespread approval, but the audit did highlight that the industry was heading in the right direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should stress that the audit report is simply that at this stage. At the time of the launch last Wednesday, the industry had not had the opportunity to go through the report in any detail or to challenge some of its findings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were some findings which did seem, at face value, to be of some concern. For example, the report said that acid soils comprised nine per cent of canegrowing land. That statement was a surprise to me. It was also a surprise to many of the canegrowers at the launch. Those findings were challenged on the spot. Of course, it is now up to the industry to look at that report, to comment on it and to move from that point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Queensland Canegrowers Council has given an undertaking to seriously evaluate the recommendations raised in the audit. It will no doubt be the basis for the development of an ongoing strategic plan. This will not only ensure that the environmental concerns of the broader community are met, but also keep Australian canegrowing practices amongst the best in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should say, as an aside, that it is disappointing that, at the time that the industry is doing such good work in its own backyard, the union movement&mdash;with typical disregard for the industry and all the people who are supported by it: growers, millers, the communities and the contractors&mdash;decided a couple of days ago to go out on strike tomorrow over <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a matter that the sugar industry can do nothing about. It is not related to the sugar industry; it is a broader industrial issue. But the union, in typical irresponsible form, is stopping the whole industry. Some 24 sugar mills, in the busiest part of the season, will be brought to a halt with a quite substantial loss of income to the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I congratulate the industry on this environmental initiative. It is particularly noteworthy that the industry, of its own accord, had the courage and foresight to commission this environmental audit. It does show a display of some courage for the industry itself, without any pushing, to take on this audit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was very pleased to be able to lend my moral support to the industry in this far&hyphen;sighted move by attending the public launch. I was disappointed to see that there were no Democrat or Greens senators at the launch. These self&hyphen;styled champions of the environment did not seem to be present. Apparently, the environment is important to them only if it involves an attack on a Queensland industry. When an industry does something positive, of its own initiative, it apparently attracts no interest among these so&hyphen;called environmental champions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as I am aware, this is an industry first. It is the first time I have been aware of a major agricultural industry taking on an environmental audit of its own volition. It is a very welcome initiative and I wholeheartedly congratulate the industry on this initiative.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise by way of personal explanation in relation to a matter that Senator McKiernan raised a short time ago in the chamber. He referred to a speech I made in the Senate on 22 August this year, wherein I mentioned the interim report of the royal commission in Western Australia, which had not yet been delivered. At the time, I said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are those in Western Australia who simply are not happy with the interim report of the royal commission which cleared Cheryl Edwardes, the Minister for Family Services, and her husband of any wrongdoing whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, that was a slip of the tongue, a mistake made by me. When one looks at the context in which it was said, one can readily see that that was so. I had been talking about an address that counsel had been making to the commissioner and the fact that the counsel assisting the commissioner, and the commissioner himself, were not able to defend any comments made about them because the matter was still continuing. Indeed, what I meant to have said, or should have said, at that stage was that there were those in Western Australia who simply would not be happy with an interim report of the royal commission which `would clear' Cheryl Edwardes, the Minister for Family Services, and her husband of any wrongdoing whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is indeed a long bow to draw to imply that I had any knowledge of what the commission's finding was going to be. If there is any implication to that effect, I reject it out of hand. That implication, indeed, would be to imply that the royal commissioner had collaborated with me, which is totally untrue. It would imply that there was, indeed, some corruption on the part of the commission and myself, which I reject entirely. If a slip of the tongue is the best that the opposition has to hang its hat on in this matter, then I am indeed sorry for them.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am grateful to Senator McKiernan for giving me notice of the fact that he was going to make mention of me in this matter. I must say that I refute entirely his comments. One only has to look at the press in Western Australia to see that Cheryl Edwardes and her husband were cleared. The public of Western Australia believe that, and it was a matter that the state government was indeed confident in. It called the royal commission. The Premier has stated on a number of occasions that he was confident that Cheryl Edwardes and her husband would be cleared, and it was a confidence which I myself always shared with the Premier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was the situation, Madam Acting Deputy President. There was nothing more or less to it than that. To imply anything further as a result of some slip of the tongue is indeed stretching things too far, and I reject any implication whatsoever that there was any collaboration or collusion between the royal commission and myself in this matter or that I had any knowledge of what was to come. I may have been confident as to the outcome&mdash;as I have indeed been in a good many cases that I have observed and been a party to&mdash;but I have also been not too confident on some cases which I have been a party to and have observed in the past. But the evidence in this case was indeed strong. As eloquently put by Narelle Johnson, the counsel assisting the royal commission, the evidence was undeniably there which led to the clearing of Mr and Mrs Edwardes.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government's decision in the budget to impose a 15 per cent surcharge on contributions for higher income earners has been universally accepted and welcomed as making the superannuation system much more fair and equitable. I think even Senator Sherry accepts that point. It is something that Labor, throughout its years in government, steadfastly refused to do. Indeed, the inequities and excessive concessionality in the system for higher income earners were two of the major flaws of the previous government's system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So far as the administration arrangements for the 15 per cent surcharge are concerned, Senator Sherry is broadly correct in terms of the mechanics, but they are still being finalised. The government is having discussions with the superannuation funds and with other interested parties and will be doing all we can to ensure that the administrative costs are minimised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have deliberately chosen the course that we have so far as administration is concerned so that we will be imposing no additional burden whatsoever on contributors or employers. It is true&mdash;we have acknowledged it up front from day one&mdash;that there will be some administrative costs imposed on the funds and there will be also additional work imposed on the Australian Taxation Office. We have resourced the Taxation Office to take account of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The additional administrative costs and activities will vary from one fund to another, but I can assure the Senate that much of the wild, speculative rumour running around about how much additional burden will be imposed on the superannuation funds in their administration is just that&mdash;rumour. It is speculative, it is unsubstantiated and you will find that many of the funds are in fact supportive of the arrangements because, as the government moves further down the superannuation route in terms of co-contribution and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> employee contribution, many of the steps they will have to take as a result of this budget's decisions will stand them in extremely good stead. In fact, they would be required for any future activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are making the situation more efficient. We are going to minimise the administration costs. We are negotiating and discussing that with the funds. I have held two seminars in the last week with major players in the industry. There is, I think, a growing understanding of the situation and a growing understanding of the fact that not only is the arrangement fair and equitable and produces, therefore, highly desirable benefits in the superannuation system but also at the end of the day we will have a more administratively efficient superannuation system.</PARA></ANSWER>

From Senator Lundy's description of it, I take it that what she said is broadly correct and, if so, that it is correct in fact, because the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> announcements in the budget will have no impact on middle and lower income public servants or, for that matter, on any other lower and middle income earners.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, as you are aware, the surcharge applies to employer contributions and, for an unfunded scheme, there are no such contributions to apply the tax to. Therefore, in the interests of equity for all superannuants and superannuant contributors, there will have to be arrangements made that will apply fairly and equitably to people, whether they are members of funded or unfunded schemes. The actuarial committee is examining and reporting on that at the moment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Three hundred and fifty-eight thousand. That will be 6,000 more than the number of places provided this year. In 1998, the number of undergraduate places will rise to 364,000. That, senators, is the minimum number of places that will be available to Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The provision for the return of HECS revenue to universities&mdash;something the previous government was never prepared to do&mdash;for overenrolled students will, of course, provide further opportunities. I note that one university has already announced that it expects it will have a 10 per cent overenrolment next year. A 10 per cent overenrolment across the sector would mean an additional 36,000 places. Universities would receive an additional $90 million in HECS contributions for those places&mdash;something, I remind you, Madam President, the previous government was never prepared to do. When universities overenrolled, the previous government took HECS from the students and kept the HECS itself instead of giving it to the universities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government's commitment to expanding opportunities for participation in education is absolutely unequivocal. The only reduction in government funded places that the government is seeking is in course work postgraduate degrees. It is important to understand that this reduction takes place against massive expansion in the last decade, particularly in the last five years. Since 1985, course work masters degrees have expanded by 200 per cent. Research masters degrees have doubled over 10 years. PhD places have doubled over the past four years and increased by 175 per cent since 1985. Government funding for <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> research postgraduate degrees will continue to expand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reductions in government funding for course work degrees will achieve a more appropriate balance between the public and private funding. Much of the expansion in higher education under Labor was in postgraduate education, giving people from generally privileged backgrounds second and third degrees. What senators opposite do not want to hear is that between 1989 and 1992&mdash;wait for this, because you probably do not know it&mdash;the number of people undertaking first degrees actually fell from 102,000 to 93,000. In other words, the previous government was happy to see the opportunities for new graduates to fall and to put those places into people getting their second and third degrees. We think it is more equitable to increase the places for undergraduate students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you realise that the average salary of a Melbourne University MBA graduate is $95,000, it is not unreasonable to say that the government is going to reduce its funding to those sorts of courses, maintain its funding for undergraduate students, maintain its funding for research students, and let the coursework students&mdash;some of whom already pay for themselves&mdash;continue to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very important that people do understand that the higher education budget put forward by this government allows for a substantial expansion of undergraduate places. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Assistant Treasurer. Minister, what steps will the government take to prevent employees earning more than $85,000 avoiding the new superannuation levy by repackaging their remuneration and taking salary benefits in a way which will not attract fringe benefits tax? What estimates has the government made of the amounts of national savings that will be lost as high income earners withdraw from voluntary superannuation in order to avoid the surcharge? Is it a specific policy of the government to catch up more and more medium income earners in the 15 per cent superannuation levy by the device of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3264"> failing to index the $70,000 point at which the levy starts to apply?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The overall impact of the budget on national savings is unequivocally positive by a very significant extent, both in terms of public sector savings and private savings. The impact of the budget on savings has to be looked at as a package, including the area of superannuation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The implication in the senator's question is that, if there is any move out of superannuation, that will have a detrimental effect on national savings. That, of course, is a false assumption because it depends entirely on where the funds might go and the uses to which they would be put. There is no earthly reason to expect that they would be put to less savings and more consumption than would otherwise be the case. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as any move away is concerned, and it is highly questionable to what extent that will happen, the funds could go into other forms of savings. If there is a repackaging of salary packages, that will not necessarily have a negative impact on the revenue because if, as the senator suggests, there is more into the FBT area, then there is a higher FBT take by the Commonwealth. So the assumptions on which the senator's question is based are inaccurate and false.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The overall aspect that is of the greatest importance is that we have made superannuation a fairer system for all Australians. That has been universally acknowledged by everyone but the Labor Party. The reason they have not acknowledged it is because they went for 13 years making the system more and more unfair and concessional for high income earners relative to low income earners. The fairness and equity of the system are there with the changes that we have introduced and, as I said at the outset, the impact of the budget as a whole, including the superannuation changes, will be positive on national savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The greatest single problem we have in this nation is a lack of national savings. In government, the Labor Party went for 13 years running down the nation's savings to ever record levels. We will never solve our basic problems of unemployment and lower <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> than optimum growth if we do not get our national savings up. We will never be able to solve the fundamental problem of weakness in our external accounts if we do not get our national savings up.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator O'Brien for his question, which gives me an opportunity to remind the Senate of the enormous benefit that the government gave small business in this budget by its decision to provide exemption from capital gains tax for the rollover of a small business into another like business. It is something that has been very much in the minds of small business for many years. They have suffered unnecessary and very costly deprivation in terms of cash flow and funds availability because of the application under the previous Labor government of the capital gains tax without exemption on rollover. It is a decision in the budget that has been very widely welcomed by the small business community and by anyone interested in the growth of the Australian economy, the growth of employment, jobs and all the other things that flow from a healthier economy, social as well as economic.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Again, I think the answer to Senator Murphy's question has been very adequately canvassed by Senator Newman over many questions. The thrust of what Senator Murphy is suggesting is that a person who has superannuation assets, who is aged between 55 and 65 and who finds himself unemployed for a period longer than nine months, should voluntarily be able to retain those assets and go onto other benefits on the public purse for a period of up to 10 years and then avail himself of his superannuation. </PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Newman has said on many occasions, and it has been repeated by the Prime Minister and the government generally, we do not believe that is fair and equitable.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the minister representing the minister for small business. Minister, you would agree that the small business sector is the engine room of job creation in Australia. You would also agree that the Labor Party's only contribution to small business over the last 13 years was an increase in taxes and paperwork, running up interest rates of over 23 per cent for small business, overseeing record small business bankruptcies and load <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3270"> ing small business down with unfair dismissal laws.

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to thank Senator Boswell very much for that question. It is interesting that we have been in government for six months now and the first question we have had from the opposition relating to small business came from a new senator today. He was silly enough to ask a question on the minutiae of capital gains tax when it was his government that brought in capital gains tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor government never recognised or had any understanding whatsoever of the small business sector. It did not recognise that there are 800,000 small business people out there who create real jobs. You went out of your way over a long period of time to make it difficult for those people to create those jobs. We all know the reason&mdash;because the industrial arm of the Labor Party does not like small business; they are traditionally non-union employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this government is doing after 13 years of devastation by the Labor government of the past is attacking the budget deficit. By doing that, the government will ensure a downward pressure on interest rates. This is vital for small business, which borrows some $46 billion from the Australian banks. The previous government's irresponsible fiscal policy, to which Senator Boswell referred, crippled many small businesses and, in the process, created high unemployment, particularly among young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have kept our election commitment to reduce the provisional uplift factor. This will inject $180 million into the small business sector, which they will then use to reinvest. We have kept our election commitment to allow small business to defer the capital gains tax arising from the sale of their business to a like business or to use it to fund retirement. Again, you never understood all that; it was beyond you. You did not understand that small business people build up their businesses for their own retirement funds. The previous government refused to do this.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have stopped the contentious tax law No. 5 which was introduced by the previous government. It would have changed the status of subcontractors, creating not only a nightmare for small business but yet another union type push to make contractors employees rather than contractors. The roping in of the industrial side became the roping in of the fiscal side. We have raised the threshold for fringe benefits tax exemptions to ease the compliance burden for small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I could give the chamber many more examples of the benefits of the budget that we bring to small business. One of the most important ones is the industrial relations reform. You were so out of touch in government. If you had had your ears and eyes half open you would have realised that the greatest disincentive to employment by the small business sector was the unfair dismissal clause in the Industrial Relations Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, former Senator Gareth Evans, is now, as he says, suffering from relevance depravation syndrome. Now he knows how small business felt over the 13 disastrous years of Labor government.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. Minister, I understand that in the next year the coalition will spend $1.6 billion on labour market programs which assist the unemployed. I also understand that over the next four years the government will spend $5.4 billion on this type of expenditure. How does this level of spending compare with Labor's spending on the unemployed when there was a similar level of unemployment?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="3272" SPEAKER="Vanstone, Sen Amanda" NAMEID="7E4" ELECTORATE="SA" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has been a degree of misunderstanding promulgated largely by the Labor Party with respect to this government's proposals on labour market assistance for the unemployed. It might be of interest to some to understand that over the next four years the government will spend $5.4 billion on labour market program assistance. I am asked by Senator Abetz to compare that with labour market expenditure by the previous government. In the equivalent number of years up until 1993-94, that is, in the pre-Working Nation years, the previous government spent $4.9 billion in real terms, that is, in prices that are constant. In the four years prior to Working Nation the previous <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3273"> government spent less than this government is now planning to spend.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to clarify some of these points. Only yesterday, when I indicated that we were spending $1.6 billion next year, Senator West interjected: `That is over four years.' Some members opposite seem to think that that expenditure is over four years when it is just next year's expenditure. In 1990-91, when unemployment was at 8.3 per cent, about the same level as it is now, labour market spending by the previous government in today's prices was only $640 million. That is, the last time unemployment was at around this level the previous government spent half the amount that we are planning to spend next year in today's prices. In 1992-93, when unemployment was at 11 per cent, labour market expenditure by the previous government was only $40 million more than will be spent this year. That is when unemployment was at the all-time high of 11 per cent under the previous Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year, when unemployment was at around 8.5 per cent, labour market spending was $2.2 billion. That is an important point to note because it highlights the fact that Labor, under its Working Nation program&mdash;which did not work&mdash;was wasting labour market expenditure money. The proof of that is that last year, when unemployment was about 8.5 per cent, they spent $2.2 million, and unemployment is still at about 8.5 per cent. That only serves to highlight the ineffectiveness of the Working Nation program. It is important to note that in the last financial year, the previous government spent, I think, $860 million on the three least effective programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you and I, Madam President, were to go to low income taxpayers through to high income taxpayers and say: `Would you like us to spend $860 million of your money on the three least effective programs we can find?', the answer would be: `No, we do not want you to do that.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, we are spending more in real prices in the four years post&hyphen;Working Nation than the previous government spent in the four years prior to Working Nation. We are spending double the amount of money in real prices that they spent in 1990-91, when <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> unemployment was at around the same level. The figures only demonstrate how much money they spent in order to promote themselves without creating real jobs and real opportunities for Australians.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The answer read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">RESPONSE TO QUESTION WITHOUT NOTICE FROM SENATOR WOODLEY&mdash;Monday 9 September 1996</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On Monday, during Question Time in the Senate, Senator Woodley asked me a question without notice concerning the budget measure to apply a deeming rate of 5 per cent to the first $2000 (and $4000 for a couple) held in deposits or cash.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I undertook to provide further information and I now have those details for the Honourable Senator.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pensioners whose only source of private income is from financial investments can only be affected by this proposal if they have total financial investments of more than $45,000 ($78,000 for couples) and they are receiving less than 5% on some of their deposits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pensioners with total deposits with financial institutions of less than $2,000 cannot be affected by this measure unless they have significant amounts of other income or assets. If a pensioner has relatively few assets and small levels of private income, he or she will continue to receive the full pension because of the general income test "free areas". These free areas allow pensioners to have assessed income of up to $49 a week ($86 a week for couples) without any effect on their pension.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The estimate that 600,000 persons in receipt of a pension paid by the Department of Social Security will be affected by this proposal was based upon records of pensioner investments and the interest rates paid on them as at 1 December 1995. All of these pensioners have relatively high levels of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3274"> income and assets. The average loss in pension was estimated at around 50 cents per fortnight. The maximum possible pension loss is $2 a fortnight. This was then used to make assumptions on a possible impact on allowance recipients.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, Social Security recipients who could be affected by the proposal could reinvest their low interest savings to earn more interest at the deeming rates, thereby increasing their total income. Some of those affected will already have done this.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this regard I am advised that nearly all of the deeming accounts offered by financial institutions (including those offered by the four major banks) pay interest at least equal to the deeming rates if the balance is over $2,000. Pensioners with total deposit savings of over $2,000 could therefore easily reinvest their low interest savings to obtain the deeming rate. Deeming accounts are at call and are easily accessible. Some deeming accounts pay the deeming rate of 5% even if the balance is below $2,000. Our information indicates that Westpac, the Bank of Melbourne, Challenge Bank and some building societies and credit unions offer this facility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am advised that many of the deeming accounts (including those offered by the major banks) are available to people receiving any type of pension or allowance payment to which extended deeming applies. They are not restricted to age pensioners.</PARA></QUESTION></QUESTION.BLOCK></QWN>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Pursuant to an order of the Senate agreed to yesterday, and on behalf of the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, I present an executive summary to the review of the Australian National Railways Commission and the National Rail Corporation conducted by Mr John Brew, and a statement relating to the document. I also seek leave to incorporate the statement in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> .</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The statement read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tabling Statement on the Brew Report</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the surprises the Labor Government left for us was the state of Australian National.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian community, and AN's employees had been assured repeatedly by former Ministers Brereton and Beazley that all was well at AN and that its future was secure. It wasn't, and they knew it.  <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They had been advised by their Departments in 1992 and 1995 that AN was experiencing serious problems and significant reform was required urgently. Laurie Brereton was also advised by the Chairman of AN in late 1995 about these problems, and instructed the Chairman not to do anything. `Its too close to the election', Mr Brereton said.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Labor Government misled the Australian people; and they cruelly misled AN employees about the health of their business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In effect, they planned for the current problems at AN, as the leader of the Opposition acknowledged on 26 August.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They established National Rail, removing from AN its major business but leaving it with all the debt accumulated by a much larger business. They then sanctioned some highly unusual commercial arrangements with NR which severely disadvantaged AN.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But they gave no thought to AN's future&mdash;they decided to do nothing to ensure it had a future. They knew what this meant&mdash;death by a thousand cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Labor Government understood the problem, understood that they had largely created it&mdash;but lacked the courage and honesty to do anything about it&mdash;to plan a future for AN and its employees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Transport and Regional Development commissioned the Brew Report soon after the Coalition Government came to Office&mdash;to reveal the true state of AN's problems and assist the Government in planning a future for AN and NR.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is now examining every aspect of its involvement in the rail industry. We are considering the Brew Report and a range of other sources of information and advice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The problems we need to address have developed over a long period, and the decisions will affect a lot of people. We are taking the opportunity to plan our future role in this industry carefully.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It hasn't been done before and we want to do it properly. A special Cabinet sub Committee is currently looking at reform options, and consulting with interested parties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate is now using its numbers to seek release of the Brew Report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am today providing the Executive Summary to the report, and the letter of transmission from Mr John Brew. The Executive Summary has been slightly modified to remove commercially sensitive material and some references to individuals&mdash;it is not appropriate that such material be publicly released at this time, although this may be possible after further consultation. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3275"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government will also consider releasing the balance of the report. We will need to examine material that is commercial in confidence, that provided to the review on a confidential basis, and that which is central to the Government's decision making process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will need to check with those people who contributed to the report that they are happy for their contributions to be made public. The report drew heavily on contributions made by people interviewed by the Review team and on written submissions to that team. These contributions were made on the basis that this was a confidential report to the Government on a range of policy and commercial matters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Their contributions were in many cases personal in nature and include commentary on individuals and groups of individuals which are reflected in the report. They had no indication, or basis for believing, that their views or submissions would be made available to the public.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Public release of this material should only occur with the agreement of these contributors&mdash;and with the deletion of material where there is no agreement to release.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This approach is consistent with past practice. I can cite some examples.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In October 1994 Senator Collins, the then Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, declined to release commercially sensitive information, and I quote</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of the documents sought contain commercially confidential and sensitive material relating to the businesses of third parties and/or ANL's current operations and business relationships. Release of these documents would be potentially prejudicial to the ongoing commercial operation of ANL and its business partners. Likewise, some documents contain records on the internal workings of government relating to confidential discussions on the privatisation process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Evans shared those concerns in speaking about this issue in September 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1993, Senator McMullan declined to produce papers concerning an individual's applications to the Australian Artists' Creative Fellowships, until the person had been consulted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">&hyphen; Senator McMullan (22 November 1993)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Brew review team consulted with over 50 individuals and organisations in preparing their report. The consultation process will almost certainly lead to some deletions from the report before it could be tabled.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In tabling this material from the Report today I want to emphasis that the Government has not made any decisions on its future role in the rail <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> industry, nor on any individual aspects of that role&mdash;including the future of AN.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth is actively considering its future role in the rail industry. The Brew Report is an important source document in that process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, it is only one of several sources of information being considered, and it is not necessarily indicative of the decisions the Government will take. The perception, which seems to be widely held, that the Report will be implemented, cannot be sustained at present. What elements of the report are to be implemented, if any, is yet to be decided.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An argument that has been used for public release of the report at this time is that there is a great deal of public uncertainty about the future of AN and the prospects of its employees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is very sensitive to the anxiety of AN's employees, and is seeking to settle these issues. No-one should assume the Government will be implementing this report in making decisions about their future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Government is committed to securing a future for the rail industry in this country. We will do it through carefully developed reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At this stage we anticipate making decisions on all elements of the Commonwealth's involvement in the rail industry in October. These will cover the future of AN and NR, and establishment of a national rail infrastructure authority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In particular, we will secure rail's future by creating an environment that encourages private sector involvement in rail operations and investment in the industry.</PARA>

<PARA>The question that was posed to Senator Short, and indeed a number of other questions in question time, related to the superannuation surcharge. I would just like to make it very clear on the issue of the surcharge itself that it is a new tax. It is called a surcharge but it <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is a 15 per cent surcharge on people earning more than $70,000. It is a graduated surcharge, up to $85,000. The Labor opposition will be supporting this new surcharge. We will be supporting this revenue raising measure.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="SHORT" NAMEID="DJ4">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator Short</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to hear that.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps you should acknowledge, Senator Short, where this new tax measure was in your election commitment, because it makes no mention of it. In fact, you went to great pains and efforts before the last election, as I am sure you have been told by people who are affected by this new measure, to say that you would not be introducing any new surcharges, any new charges or any new taxes. This is a direct breaking of that commitment that you gave before the election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But putting aside that issue, where we raise our concerns is with the way in which you propose to collect this new surcharge, because the effect of this new surcharge and the administrative arrangements that you have announced to date is that the superannuation funds will have to establish effectively de facto miniature tax offices within the funds themselves in order to collect this new surcharge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the fascinating things about this issue&mdash;and Senator Short went very, very close to misleading the Senate on this matter when he talked about funds welcoming the administrative arrangements&mdash;is that I have not yet met or had any submission from any superannuation fund that has welcomed the proposed administrative arrangements of this new surcharge. There has not been one fund. In fact, to the contrary. There have been many funds who have complained bitterly about the administrative complexity involved in the collection of this new 15 per cent surcharge&mdash;and not only that issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point of the question in question time related to the cost of the administration of this new surcharge being passed on to all people in superannuation. All of the 15 million superannuation accounts will have to pay a part of the administrative cost of this new surcharge that is supposed to apply only to people earning more than $70,000. Senator <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3277"> Short did not acknowledge, in response to my question, that there will be some people who earn less than $70,000 who will be affected by this new surcharge. Looking at the puzzled face of Senator Short, that is people who do not provide their tax file number or may not know that they have to provide it. I see you are nodding in agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there will be a range of people who earn less than $70,000, who will have to be taxed this new 15 per cent surcharge in addition to the other 15 per cent in, 15 per cent out. They will be granted a refund, but the complexity of doing that, returning money to members' accounts, will be very, very difficult and very, very costly.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to speak to the same matter&mdash;the answer of the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Short) to the Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Sherry). It was interesting that, when responding as best he could, Senator Short said that Senator Sherry was broadly correct in his question. The question outlined the complete administrative nightmare that this initiative by the government will create. It details what the superannuation funds will have to do in liaison with the tax office for 15 million accounts in this country in order to target that small proportion of the community who are on incomes of over $70,000 a year and making contributions to superannuation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Short said that this administrative nightmare, as described by Senator Sherry, was broadly correct. What he could not do, of course, was explain how this new tax that the government has introduced, despite its election commitments to the contrary, would be implemented. This tax was introduced on 20 August this year. It is already in operation. We are not talking about government plans; we are talking about a tax that the government has introduced. Senator Short is unable to explain in any detail how it is currently being applied to taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People who should have paid this tax on their recent contributions are currently retiring from the work force. What has Senator Short said about how that is going to be recouped, how it is going to be assessed? It is a complete mess. Senator Short cannot answer any questions that go to the detail of this measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He has refused to admit to the other major failing of this measure; that is, the administrative cost of this will be shared by all fund members, not just those earning over $70,000 per annum. The government is very keen to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3278"> espouse the rhetoric of attacking the rich and protecting the poor. But the reality of this measure is that the superannuation funds will have to meet the huge cost of administering this program. In doing so, the cost will be spread among all the fund members. So all 15 million accounts will have to be assessed, and the costs associated with that process will be spread among all working men and women who are paying into superannuation. Senator Short either does not know that or refuses to admit it. It is a cost on all people contributing to superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of my associates said to me that Senator Short should have been an ASIO spy rather than a minister, because as an ASIO spy he would be great if he was ever captured&mdash;he would never answer any questions. They could torture him, they could do what they liked, but Senator Short will never answer any questions. We had another example today where he refused to answer any questions. He either does not know the answer or simply refuses to be accountable to the Senate. The whole superannuation industry are bemoaning the fact that they invite him along to their conferences and lunches and he is unable to provide any detailed answers to their questions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I reiterate that it is not the detail of a government proposal that may be implemented in the future that we seek; this is detail of a tax currently applicable to members of the Australian community. It is a tax that people should already be paying. Senator Short cannot give us the detail, he cannot provide any information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He also cannot answer the question about indexation, about bracket creep. What happens when people who are currently on $60,000 or $65,000 a year get wage increases? There has been no mention about indexation. Is this just a revenue grab by the government? Will he protect people who are currently on those incomes as inflation starts to bite?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no detail on how the measure will impact on defined benefit funds. Some industry experts have suggested that this will be the death of defined benefit funds and that this will increasingly lead to accumulation <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> accounts rather than pension accounts. I want to know whether the government endorses that strategy or not. There is a whole range of issues that need answers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about the privacy issue, Minister? I assume that you are going to allow superannuation funds to have access to tax file numbers and use them to make the system work. None of that detail has been released. You cannot answer any questions about it. You say that we are broadly correct when we raise the complete administrative mishmash and nightmare of this proposal, and you cannot give any detail about a tax that you have already implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It certainly has the effect of reminding me of the last Premiers Conference and the tax measures that the Treasurer (Mr Costello) announced there. You just do not seem to be on top of the brief. You cannot provide any explanations. It is an outrage that the relevant minister cannot handle his own portfolio.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What we have just witnessed is Senator Chris Evans listing off about 20 questions, all of which were not asked during question time, and expecting the minister to have provided answers to all those questions in the four minutes that are allocated to him during question time. I suggest to Senator Evans that if he wants an answer to all those questions he put them on notice, and I am sure that the minister will provide answers to them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He is trying to set up a situation where Senator Short was asked all these questions during question time&mdash;which he was not&mdash;and then say that Senator Short did not answer them. The reality is that he was not even asked all those questions. It took Senator Evans five minutes to ask all those questions, and in question time you get only one minute to ask all the questions. So you are condemned out of your own mouths.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Labor Party either set up the straw men to knock them down, like Senator Evans did, or used the other tactic, which is the tactic of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate; that is, if you shout loud enough, hopefully that will overcome the deficiency in your argument. We are getting used now to Senator Sherry shouting very <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3279"> loudly, following the quite pathetic example of his leader when asking questions and making statements in this chamber&mdash;thinking that somehow volume adds to the quality of the speech.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that it does not and people out there listen very carefully and make their determination. They made their determination on 2 March 1996. Of course, what the Labor Party is suffering from, as Gareth Evans so rightly said, is relevance depravation syndrome. And it really is hurting them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was very cruel of Senator Sherry to set up his Tasmanian colleague Senator Denman with that question which was so embarrassing that Senator Denman is now out of the chamber. Senator Sherry should have known better and treated his Tasmanian colleague with a bit more respect. He farmed another one out to Senator Murphy, who has also disappeared from the chamber, undoubtedly out of embarrassment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we need in this debate is to get back to the basics. The basics are that the opposition wrecked the economy over a period of 13 years and they have no shame whatsoever in the way they treated this economy. Now we are charged with fixing it up. We are doing the job for the people, getting the economy back on track. Sure, we are taking some hard decisions, some tough decisions, but what is hurting the Australian Labor Party so very much is the overwhelming success of this budget. That is what is hurting you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Your shadow Treasurer has acknowledged that it is hurting him. It is miserable, it is sickening, it is hurtful&mdash;all those things that Mr Gareth Evans is now telling us. He is telling us what is actually in the heart of the Australian Labor Party. In they caucus they say, `What can we think of to try to attack the government?' because the budget has been such a success. It hurts them, it narks them and they do not know how to react. At least Mr Evans is honest about it. He is saying that he is struggling with the relevancy deprivation syndrome, but Senator Sherry does not.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What we have seen here today is a complete attempt to mislead this Senate, firstly when Senator Short infers that the Labor Party will not be supporting the surcharge. No such conclusion could be drawn from any of the questions asked today. What we have asked is what the consequences of implementation will be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that there are something like 15 million superannuation accounts floating around in this country. It is incumbent upon them, according to this government, to do all <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3281"> the necessary administration of searches and relations with the tax office in order to implement this so that the government does not pick up the cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Probably no more than a million at best of those 15 million accounts would be owned or in some ways connected to the 335,000 people who earn more than $85,000 a year in this country. What that means is that every one of those accounts has to be researched. A lot of them will not have tax file numbers because it was not compulsory. The enormous administrative cost of that, by law, is spread right across every policyholder, every superannuant&mdash;not just the rich. So, in effect, all those costs are borne equally, no matter what your income or what your superannuation is. That is a diminution of the rights of those particular people.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="KEMP" NAMEID="WW4">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator Kemp</NAME></TALKER>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is no use saying that it is our law. You have put the additional cost on without thinking about it. This is a government that shoots first and thinks afterwards. They want to go and soak the rich. Why not put an extra one per cent on income tax? It would raise the same revenue and have nothing like the same administrative burden.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we point out that the latest change to over 55&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds will force a lot of those people to go and get new financial advice, what do we have? We have the junior senator from Tasmania coming in saying what a stupid question it was. That is good from him. If anyone is a few runs short of the follow&hyphen;on it is Senator Abetz. But does he not understand the psychology of this age group?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the complexity of superannuation laws, which this whole parliament is guilty of, if you like&mdash;I do not just throw that to the other side&mdash;it has become necessary for people in this particular age group to go and seek some financial guidance. They go to experts and most of these experts charge $150 an hour for their financial advice. I am advised that an average transaction takes 2&half; hours, which would cost between $300 and $400 to seek this advice. A lot of them went and sought that advice six months or a year ago and paid that money then. What are they <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> going to have to do now? They are going to have to go back and do exactly the same thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just in case anyone thinks it is only the 67,000 people affected who are going to go through that particular process, it is a lot more. People will not know whether they are affected, so it is going to be a much bigger group that goes and gets this financial advice. At a minimum it is going to cost $20 million payout by these people overall, maybe up to $40 million. This is an awful lot of money that they have to spend in this particular regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, of course, Senator Short had no idea about the cost to revenue and national savings of these people&mdash;I am not talking about the over 55s; I am talking about the people earning more than $85,000 a year&mdash;who transfer and rearrange their salary packages in the term of a loan to go into a negatively geared property that will not even attract fringe benefits tax and thereby diminish the amount of federal revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is well known that superannuation issues are complex&mdash;I concede that&mdash;but, really, when you are Assistant Treasurer and you have very little else to do, superannuation should be your go. It should be the one area he is able to master. Senator Short goes up to Queensland and what does he do? He takes all the questions on notice. `I'll take these on notice,' he says. `These are a bit too hard. I don't have Senator Watson backing me up,'&mdash;old squeaky there, who at least does know something about it. He takes the questions on notice and comes in here and goes up every byway he can without actually confronting the question. You are a minister. You should be able to answer on this particular question. On a more obscure macro-economic policy or tax law you are forgiven, but on a thing like superannuation you should be able to answer those questions. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

But I do welcome Senator Sherry's acknowledgment, on behalf of the opposition, for the thrust and the basic policy decision&mdash;and it is the basic decision&mdash;in the budget in relation to superannuation. What is absolutely amazing is that the opposition spent the whole of today trying to launch an attack on a policy which they now have the graciousness to tell us that they support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing that is hypocritical beyond belief is that Labor senators opposite got up and accused this government of complexity in the administration scheme of superannuation and the complexity of the superannuation system, when it was 13 years of Labor government that produced the almost unfathomable superannuation system that we have today. We are absolutely committed to restoring some sanity into the superannuation system, to restoring some fairness into the superannuation system and to restoring simplicity in the administration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So far as Labor is concerned, Senator Conroy's contribution was very interesting. It was really Labor politics of hate. He had a go at the banks, as if the banks were going to be the only beneficiaries out of the establishment of RSAs. He knows that is not true. RSAs are going to be provided by banks, LIFA offices, credit unions and building societies. They are also going to be provided in like form by superannuation funds. They cannot be identical because superannuation funds operate under a trust structure. It is an absolute monstrous lie and a monstrous distortion of the truth to suggest that RSAs are going to be simply provided by the banks. He knows that absolutely. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have done in this budget in relation to superannuation&mdash;and, indeed, to many other things&mdash;is to introduce an element of fairness into the system which Labor, in 13 years, had not the courage nor the willingness to do. This attempted attack on administration&mdash;and it has fallen sickeningly short of any sort of attack&mdash;is all about the fact that you are worried about your mates in the union movement that you propped up and protected for 13 years. You gave them a special privileged position which will no longer continue. There is also a considerable amount of detail contained in the budget papers in relation to the proposals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also consulting widely. We have an actuarial committee set up to advise on many of these matters. Of course, the legislation has still to be drafted and introduced after we have had the consultation. The difference between us and the opposition is that we believe in consultation. We believe in having legislation which is framed in the best possible way after the best consultation you can get. Labor is absolutely opposed to consultation, and that is why they are so concerned about the situation at the moment. There is much detail already there.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Vietnam Veterans' Delegation to Vietnam</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some four weeks ago it was my privilege to lead a representative group of Vietnam veterans to Vietnam, Singapore and Malaysia. This visit was part of the Australia Remembers Vietnam 1962- <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3283">1973 commemorative program. It was but one of several activities held last month to mark Vietnam Veteran's Day&mdash;August 18. That is the day that we recall Australia's involvement in the Vietnam conflict and the courage, commitment and sacrifice of the 59,000 Australians who had a role to play in it. In particular it is a time to remember the 508 Australians who, in the course of the Vietnam conflict, gave their lives in the service of their country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was particularly significant in commemorating our involvement in Vietnam, that we were able to take a representative group of Vietnam veterans, back to Vietnam. It enabled the veterans to confront and understand many of the memories that have been with them and their families for the last thirty years. It was an opportunity for them to see the beauty of the country and the warmth of the people, when mostly they could only remember the ugliness and the horror of war. And now those who were part of the delegation have the opportunity to share that experience&mdash;a profoundly healing one&mdash;with their families, friends and fellow veterans.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was an honour and a privilege for me to be in the company of thirty such fine Australians. Their remarkable good humour, support for one another and pride in their country was a true highlight of the visit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to report to Members of the House some of the significant events of the visit and then outline what I believe are the major benefits that will come to all Australians as a result of this visit. It was an experience which deserves to be shared.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, may I express my appreciation to my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Honourable Alexander Downer. His personal efforts and representations to the Vietnamese government were critical to the visit's success. I would also like to record my thanks to Australia's Ambassador to Vietnam, Her Excellency, Ms Sue Boyd, and the staff of the Australian Embassy in Hanoi and the Australian Consulate-General in Ho Chi Minh City. Without their unflagging efforts, the visit would not have been the outstanding success, that ultimately, it was.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I must also say how much the Australian Government has appreciated the assistance and cooperation of the Government of Vietnam and the Peoples Committees in the provinces we visited, in making the tour program possible. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam more than twenty years ago, the relationship between our two countries has continued to grow in strength. We value this relationship very much and I am sure that visits such as these can only add to that strength. I understand that the Vietnamese Government were very satisfied with the way in which the veterans' visit proceeded.  <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are grateful, too, to the High Commissioners of Malaysia and Singapore and their staff, for the assistance they provided to the delegation while we were visiting those countries. The assistance provided by the governments of Malaysia and Singapore was also very much appreciated by the members of the delegation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The visit program, which began on 11 August, involved 27 Vietnam Veterans, 2 widows and a descendant of a serviceman killed in Vietnam. These thirty people were randomly selected to represent the more than 59,000 Australians who served in Vietnam. All three arms of the services were represented as well as philanthropic organisations and official entertainers who had served in Vietnam. All States and the two territories of Australia were represented in the group. The Shadow Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the Member for Cunningham, was also part of the delegation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first major commemorative activity of the tour was a ceremony at the Terendak Military Cemetery in Malaysia. It is here that 24 Australian servicemen killed in Vietnam are buried, including Major Peter Badcoe VC, whose widow, Mrs Denise Clark, was one of the veteran party.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the prologue in the order of service noted: "The graves here have not been kept separate from others in the cemetery. They have not been put to one side as though they did not belong, but neither have they been held up as heroes. Though it is called a military cemetery, it is very much a community cemetery. There are children here, and wives. There are young soldiers and older ones. In one way, this is as it should be. Our veterans, taken by circumstance and duty from us, have in death been returned to the wider community".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a moving and, for some, a very emotional ceremony we recalled the sacrifice made by all those Australians who died in Vietnam. The Australian serviceman or woman draws on a proud tradition stretching back nearly 100 years. The hallmarks across the years have been dedication, a pride in their work, a seriousness of purpose and a sense of achievement. In Vietnam that tradition was carried on.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At Kranji War Cemetery in Singapore our second commemorative service recalled all who had served in Vietnam. After the laying of wreaths, we moved a short distance to the Kranji Military Cemetery where the first Australian serviceman to be killed in action in Vietnam is buried. Warrant Officer Kevin Conway was a member of the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam. He was killed in July 1964 when the Special Forces outpost of Nam Dong was attacked by enemy forces.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But these activities, important though they were, were in many ways a prelude to the group's arrival in Vietnam. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3284"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As we arrived in Vietnam and throughout the duration of the visit, we were greeted with genuine warmth and friendship. From the Vice-Minister for Labour, War Invalids and Social Affairs, Mr Nguyen Van Quang to the Vice President of the Ho Chi Minh City War Veterans Association, Major General Nguyen Van Si, right through to the humblest of the village folk, the welcome was always the same&mdash;warm and friendly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During my calls on Vice Minister Quang and Major General Si I was able to stress that this visit by the delegation of veterans demonstrated the sincerity of Australia's commitment to Vietnam. They stressed that the Australian level of commitment was reciprocated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the Dong Nai museum in Bien Hoa, we were privileged to see the original Long Tan Cross, erected by Australians after the battle of Long Tan, which was fought on 18 August 1966. In that battle, D Company of 6RAR, held off a numerically superior enemy force. Eighteen Australians lost their lives in the battle.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Possibly the most poignant moments of the visit came when the group reached the Long Tan battlefield itself. In August 1966, when the battle raged, it was a rubber plantation. Today the area is a cornfield. Nevertheless, the Long Tan Cross site is still preserved in the middle of the field. A replica of the original cross has been made and erected in the original location. The site itself is in good repair and clearly regarded with respect as there is an undisturbed area around the site which has not been ploughed up. It is obvious that the villagers of Long Tan care for the site which means so much to Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cross itself is believed to be located at the point were Jim Richmond, another member of our party, was found, wounded, the day after the battle of Long Tan.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On August 18, Vietnam Veteran's Day, we were joined by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, the Honourable Tim Fischer, for a ceremony at Nui Dat. This would be the first time an Australian government group would hold a commemorative ceremony in Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Deputy Prime Minister's address highlighted the cost to both sides in the war. He said: "Inevitably, of course, we remember the heroism of our friends and comrades. But we also acknowledge the courage of those Vietnamese against whom we fought. In the years since the war, many of us have come to know our former opponents as friends and so it is natural that, at a service such as this, we honour the Vietnamese fallen."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The veterans then joined the Deputy Prime Minister and many local officials and veterans for the unveiling of a plaque by Mr Fischer at the site of the Ba Ria Australian Vietnam Veterans' Recon <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> struction Group Orphans and Disabled Children's Centre. The AVVRG, led by their president, Paul Murphy, is making a very positive contribution to the development of important infrastructure in the Ba Ria Vung Tau province.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This centre will provide the necessary facilities to care for many of the district's less fortunate children. Funding for the project comes from AVVRG members themselves with a contribution from the Australian Government. Australian companies in Vietnam have also been able to contribute to this project through the provision of building materials. This project is an important one, giving as it does, hope to those children in the Ba Ria Vung Tau province who will use its facilities. In any country, Vietnam as well as Australia, children are the future, and anything that we can do to ensure that they are given every opportunity to develop their potential as good citizens and leaders of the community should be encouraged.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But for me one of the important benefits of this visit program was the linkages that were made with many who once were enemy. Time and time again, from officials, from retired Vietnamese army officers who had once fought against Australians, came the message: "It is time to put the past behind us, build links for the future, but never forget those who suffered and died."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is the message that I have conveyed to Australian ex-service organisations, most recently at the RSL's National Congress held last week in Tweed Heads.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the orphanage site, for example, the now retired Lieutenant Colonel Nguyen Van Kiem, former commanding officer of D445 battalion which fought against the Australian forces at Long Tan, chatted enthusiastically with our veterans. We also met with Colonel Nguyen Thanh Hong, the former operations officer of 5 VC Division and the planner of the Battle of Long Tan. Colonel Hong has been quite ill, and it speaks volumes, I think, that he made such a determined effort to meet with us.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For some of those veterans or family members who went on this revisit program there were, I am sure, moments of deep, and perhaps painful, reflection. For some it may have meant a stepping away from the past, a closing of a chapter in their lives. For others, it was confirmation that our two countries can put aside the past, and work together as regional neighbours.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These thirty veterans, were ambassadors for all Australians and particularly for the 59,000 who served in Vietnam. The significance of our involvement in Vietnam should not be understated. It was our longest running continuous military commitment as a nation. Now, as each of the veteran representatives returns home and begins to relate his or her experiences and feelings to others in the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3285"> Vietnam veteran community, no doubt they will be catalysts for healing for others.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But despite the hope and promise we all share for the future, we can not and must not, forget the personal price that many Australians paid in serving their country. It was a turbulent time in our nation's history and tragically many of our veterans and their families felt the impact of that turbulence during their service and on their return home.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The comments of one of the veterans at the Welcome Home reception hosted at Sydney airport by my colleague the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, crystallised for me, the healing value of visits such as these. After the first commemorative ceremony, the memories and the emotion were too much, he said. He thought he couldn't go on. After the second ceremony in Singapore, again he thought, this is too much, I can't go on. After the visit to Long Tan, he knew it would be hard, but he wanted to go on. The healing had begun. Now he would like to take his family on a return visit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would not be out of place I believe, if I were to paraphrase part of what I said at the ceremony at Kranji. "To each of you who served in Vietnam, we say thank you. We know that for some the cost was high. For some it was their very lives; for others it was a hurt and suffering that even the passage of time has not yet healed. But we recognise and value your experiences and we shall endeavour to ensure that all Australians today and in the future know and remember, as well."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australians generally take a great deal of interest in Vietnam. Yet, even so, the relationship between Vietnam and Australia is a lot closer than some people realise. The twinning of Vung Tau and the Australian city of Parramatta is but one example of the increasing friendship between our two countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many of our large companies have set up offices there to work together with Vietnamese partners to develop important business and trade links. Indeed, the visits by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and by the Veterans group will, I am sure, not only further strengthen the already very strong relationship between our two countries, but assist in furthering opportunities for Vietnam and Australia to cooperate in a range of fields. There are a myriad of opportunities available to Australian companies. The proud and responsible way in which our veterans have represented Australia during and since their involvement in the Vietnam conflict has played a significant role in developing the strong relationship that exists today between the two countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have many reasons to remember those Australians who served in Vietnam. Some thirty years on, it is time to thank them also.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report which I have just tabled deals with the activities of the Public Works Committee during 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What a busy year it was.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, some statistics.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We met on 98 occasions, conducted 32 public hearings and 40 inspections.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We met at locations throughout Australia&mdash;not just in capital cities and major regional centres where one would expect the bulk of Commonwealth public works proposals to be constructed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We ranged far and wide&mdash;to remote locations such as Christmas Island, Maralinga, Ceduna, Puckapunyal, Canungra&mdash;to name a few.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We presented 29 reports on projects estimated to cost in excess of 1.5 billion dollars. It was a busy year in comparison with previous years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1994 we presented 14 reports on 320 million dollars worth of projects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1993 it was nine reports on works costing 252 million dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1992 it was 21 reports on 1.4 billion dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In short, last year was one the busiest and most productive years in the Committee's long history. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Parliament, and the people of Australia were well served by the Committee whose role is essentially that of a watchdog of Commonwealth public works.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee examined projects wide&hyphen;ranging in purpose and cost.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In terms of their stated purposes, they ranged from Defence projects, to office accommodation, law courts, CSIRO laboratories, overseas works, soil decontamination and Defence housing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In terms of cost, these ranged from 6.8 million dollars for a Defence Housing Authority project at HMAS Cerberus to a massive 264 million dollars to be spent in the Northern Territory on Stage 2 of the Army Presence in the North project.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Defence housing projects costing more than 232 million dollars were examined during the year. They involved housing developments at Canungra, Westernport, Darwin and Townsville.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also reported on overseas public works estimated to cost 74 million dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I should mention here that the Act prevents the Committee from formally meeting and conducting official business overseas&mdash;this in effect means that a very important component of the Committee's operational procedures&mdash;site inspections&mdash;are not possible at present.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Instead, the Overseas Property Group provide us with a video of proposed new sites, or of existing conditions, and a model of what is proposed to be constructed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is therefore being asked to report on multi&hyphen;million dollar projects with incomplete or inadequate information available.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have attempted to get around this unsatisfactory arrangement by undertaking inspections individually whilst in the various locations on other parliamentary business or at our own expense.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the year themes and issues common to a number of inquiries emerged and appropriate recommendations were made in reports. These included the need for sponsors and designers to adopt more stringent energy conservation measures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's concerns have resulted in a review of energy standards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee continued to insist that solar hot water heaters be provided in houses being constructed by the Defence Housing Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a number of instances environmental clearances were not obtained before projects were referred to the Committee. This resulted in one instance in a proposed site being declared unsuitable for development due to the presence of an endangered species of earless dragon lizard. The result was a new site had to be found and additional expenditure of 650,000 dollars was incurred. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3287"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One area of concern involves soil or site contamination. The rehabilitation of the former British nuclear test sites at Maralinga in South Australia is a case in point.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cost estimate was $104 million. I am happy to say that about half of the cost will be borne by the British taxpayers. As is our practice, we spent a day at Maralinga during which the Commonwealth's experts in nuclear test site remediation showed us the extent of the problem and the ways in which contaminated soil and test detritus will be made safe.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A newly developed technique which will encapsulate highly radioactive material such as plutonium in a substance resembling glass or granite will be used in the project. The technique is called in situ vitrification which involves enormous amounts of electricity being transmitted through two electrodes into the soil.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of course, being newly developed technology, the Committee adopted a cautious approach, and recommended that before full&hyphen;scale in situ vitrification commences, smaller scale trials should be undertaken to provide assurances that encapsulation and mixing meets prescribes standards. This has now been successfully undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other projects involving remediation or uncertainty were the site selected for a housing development in Darwin, the need for the site of the Australian embassy complex in Hanoi and the new High Commission in Port Moresby to be declared free of unexploded ordnance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cost of projects continued to be a matter of concern, especially professional fees for consultancies and considerable sums set aside for contingencies. The Committee continued to question the proportion of project costs allocated for these areas. This will continue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report gives well&hyphen;deserved credit to the untiring efforts of two former members of the Committee&mdash;Ray Braithwaite and Ben Humphreys, who, throughout the past year, and previous years, continued to question sponsors and designers about mechanisms designed to deter collusive tendering, and guarantee the payment of subcontractors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The latter is now covered by Australian Standard 2124 which should serve as the basis of any tender documents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the question of collusive tendering&mdash;otherwise known as anti&hyphen;competitive conduct, we know that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission found evidence of it in the Brisbane concrete market and has imposed heavy fines. This will hopefully serve as a salutary lesson to the construction industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report acknowledges the leadership of the former Chairman of the Committee, the Honourable <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Member for Throsby, during 1995 which marked the tenth year of his appointment to the Committee and his eighth year as Chairman.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am sure that the House recognises that under his leadership, the Public Works Committee has earned an enviable reputation as a watchdog, and maintained its long tradition of a bipartisan approach to all enquires.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Honourable Member for Throsby has been scrupulously fair in his decisions and tenacious in his questioning of all who appeared before the Committee at public hearings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report acknowledges the efforts of a number of members whose term of office expired. They were Mr Ray Braithwaite, Mr Russ Gorman, Mr Ben Humphreys and Senator Bryant Burns.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They brought to the Committee a wide range of backgrounds and interests, many of which were reflected during the public examination of witnesses and in the Committee's reports. Again, the Parliament was well served.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's Secretariat, under the leadership of Peter Roberts, also deserve recognition and thanks. As I mentioned earlier, last year was characterised by a record number of references and reports and attendant travel, inspections, public hearings, report consideration, private meetings and briefings which required to be organised. All members of the secretariat rose to the challenges and achieved the desired results.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the report to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA>These amendments relate to the development plans. Development plans are required where there is a major development project. Major developments include a few straight forward developments like new runways or runway extensions or a new terminal or terminal extension. Most of the other developments need to be projects involving the expenditure of over $10 million or such higher amount as is prescribed. My amendments would add a requirement for submission for a plan if a development is likely to have a significant environmental or ecological impact or if it affected a site noted as evironmentally significant in the environmental strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> You can imagine that many communities might be concerned that the changes that could occur in plans that do not have to be submitted as a plan may well have major environmental impacts but may not be anywhere near $10 million in dollar amounts. Currently, there is no need to bring such new developments to the attention of the minister or the department although the lessee might have to indicate how they had managed the impact in a subsequent environmental strategy if the impact was on site. But there are cases <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> where the impact is not on site, so currently the impact might be ignored or not even noted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The requirement for a development plan occurs whenever there is a major development. I have fears that the definition of `major development' is too large. I believe there may be significant impacts to the community or the environment in less costly developments, and I believe there is scope for a company to do a sequence of developments of, say, $9 million each and so avoid this requirement altogether. You can imagine the sort of development by stealth, and that could be any number of different kinds of developments in terms of buildings and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot try to fix everything in this bill, but putting this amendment will ensure that, where there is a significant environmental impact that is likely from a project, the lessee should prepare a development plan. For example, if there is an ecologically significant wetland on the airport site&mdash;as there is in Perth&mdash;or if there is one nearby and a development project includes elements that would either result in increased or decreased run-off, there is a potential to either lower the water table having a big effect on water quality and species balance or to result in the run-off of pollutants leading to toxic or eutrophic effects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It could be a cheap development, say, establishing a heavily fertilised lawn, a parking lot or a drainage system to take water away from the area. I believe it is the responsibility of operators of an airport to be accountable for such developments. The master plan or environmental strategy are for a five&hyphen;year period and may continue longer without revision, while a development plan must be submitted whenever there is a significant development. I think the level of development considered major or significant is too big. It allows many developments which may be environmentally significant to impact on the community without federal scrutiny and, therefore, without community scrutiny. Nonetheless, such major plans should, where they clearly note an environmental or noise impact, include an explanation of how these will be addressed, since they will not need to make <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3290"> revisions in the environmental strategy. I seek the support of the committee for my amendments.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA>The development plan is required for every major development, whether or not it is included in the master plan. We are particularly concerned with the way new developments are likely to affect the environment. Increasing environmental protection was the major outcome of the amendments we have already proposed to this section, in particular the need to include a development plan wherever there is a significant environmental impact, regardless of the cost of the project. I have also called for lessees to state their management plans, as well as the likely impact on their development plans. I now draw your attention to the fact that section 122 says that non&hyphen;compliance with the environmental strategy is not an offence. However, under section 81 it is an offence to do a development without a development plan, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> or not in compliance with a development plan, and the draft development plan is open to public comment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our amendments assure that there are penalties for non&hyphen;compliance with the environmental management aspects of the development plan but, in our assessment, those penalties are very light. We are talking about a plan costing, for instance, over $10 million and very large corporations that are lessees. The current penalties are only $25,000. We propose penalties more in line with the consumer protection portion of the Trade Practices Act. Typically, they are $40,000 for individuals and $200,000 for companies. We propose that the level of penalties for non&hyphen;compliance with development plans for airports should be consistent with part V of the Trade Practices Act, that is, dealing with consumer protection. We are saying that, if it is not an offence, there should at least be a realistic penalty for non&hyphen;compliance.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA>The major shortfall of the regulations themselves is twofold. They only cover the on&hyphen;site impact of pollution waste and noise impact other than from aircraft in flight. They do not cover the general impact of activity on habitat and biota. So if you are looking at the effect of a particular strategy, we have included biota or habitat, natural or heritage values and sites of significance to Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current wording does not consider the impact of general activity, as I said, and does not consider the impact of all activities or activities that affect off&hyphen;site environments. The lessees do need to consider such general and off&hyphen;site impacts in their strategy, but government cannot draft regulations on those areas. The fact that the restriction is specific also casts doubt on the necessity of the lessee considering such impacts, since there is no explicit requirement to consider them. The requirements of the strategy also do not explicitly refer to noise impacts, so the regulations may cast doubt on their inclusion, particularly because noise was explicitly included in requirements for what must be included in the master plan and development plan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My amendments to clause 107 would include biota, habitat and these other issues in the strategy. Clause 118 indicates that the minister must consider the noise impact. My amendment to this clause adds the need for the minister to consider impact on biota and habitat, natural or heritage values and sites of significance to indigenous people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These amendments add to clause 124 the ability to regulate regarding biota and habitat, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3292"> heritage value and areas of significance to Aboriginal people. Airport activities may impact on such things and regulations may be worthwhile, even if they are only guidelines as to what the lessee must consider and what the lessee must do in the way of examining the impact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clause 125 switches from prevention or minimisation of impacts to monitoring, remedying or rectifying impacts. My amendments also extend these regulations to biota and habitat, heritage and significance for indigenous people, in the same way. Whilst it might be considered that there are powers under other acts which might allow such things to occur, if the bill specifies that `the minister may make regulations on the following', it could well be argued by companies involved that regulations falling outside that in relation to airports may fall outside the purview, or it might not be a natural way of thinking by the relevant minister in terms of what is required to regulate the activity in and around airports&mdash;especially, as I said, the fact that many FAC airports around Australia include a buffer zone. Many of those buffer zones, by historical accident, include some very important areas of remnant urban bushland or even rural bushland. So it is important that there is at least the means by which this is considered to be part of what a minister can do in helping to look after the area held under a lease.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA>This amendment removes the capacity of the Commonwealth to exempt airport lessees from state and territory environmental law. Commonwealth exemptions have been a problem in the past, as they are currently. We need look no further than the exemptions currently given to Telstra and Optus on stringing overhead cables or putting up towers to see this. We need look no further than the level of community concern about the proposals in the future to provide further amnesties for that to happen. The community has many concerns about this, especially as it is going further and further into the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we wanted to look further, some of the Defence exemptions are truly worth noting. There is no good reason to exempt an airport lessee from state environmental law. The government claims that maybe the states would use an ability to set higher environmental standards than the Commonwealth does for airports to hold the Commonwealth to ransom or somehow gain a huge power. But this is something different. You are not asking for the power to ensure that the states do not make incredibly strict environmental law; you are demanding the right to exempt the airport lessees from ordinary state and territory environmental law. This is odious. I consider it is a potentially disastrous situation, based on past performance in relation to the power to exempt companies from state environmental law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As more and more of the effects of competition policy bite, I think the community will be watching very carefully to see whether or not exemptions are passed to the private sector, whether or not the Commonwealth is really going to be able to look after the community concerns, and whether or not the normal laws of environment and planning will apply.</PARA></SPEECH>

That is a reasonable thing. If in the end we have the ability to regulate down environmental standards, one would think that might create a problem.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA>The Airports Bill cannot be seen, in my opinion, as a good bill, regardless of the improvements that have been made. There is still far too much scope for abuse, high charges and, with a compliant minister or government, a lack of rigour in responding to environmental impact and ensuring they are avoided or properly managed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that there may be scope for a responsible minister to assure a decent outcome, but there is little or no scope for either the parliament, state or territory government, local government or the community to actually affect the outcome of the approval process or how the breaches of plans are handled. Yet the minister has significant powers. She or he can override state and territory environmental law. They can exempt lessees from state and territory environmental law. As we have seen, that is what they wish to do and continue to do. A local government gets no look in at all. The minister can approve any project, no matter how bad the impact or how poor that management plan. They can choose to ignore breaches of law or the agreements a company makes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of breaches of the environmental strategy, as I noted before, it is not an offence not to comply. An injunction can be sought under part 15, but only by a minister. The only recourse for the public, including state or local government, is the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. That is bounded by conditions that make ministerial decisions unquestionable. They include the issuance or non-issuance of an injunction, which is the measure to be taken for non-compliance with the environmental strategy. I believe that the public, state or territory government, local government, community or environmental groups, indigenous people and so on need the right to object to what has been done. It is not right to allow untrammelled executive power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People should have the right to take a breach or a threatened breach of this act or the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act to court. Parliament will no longer have an effective role in controlling executive power in relation to airports after this bill is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3295"> passed. There must be some check on the system and the appropriate one is a judicial one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Aggrieved parties can apply. They can currently apply under a number of acts, including the environment protection act, but the difficulty is in establishing the right to appear as an aggrieved party. We have seen various cases where it is difficult for communities to raise issues in the court because they have not been judged to be aggrieved; they have not been given standing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Especially with environmental damage, it is difficult to approve a personal loss in regard to loss of environmental quality and even more difficult when that loss is something as abstract as the basic right of a wetlands or species to exist. How can that be considered a personal loss? How can it even be considered a loss to a local council or environmental naturalist group? We know it is, but it is difficult under law for that to be proved. It is difficult to argue and my fear is that it will not be able to be argued.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the other hand, there are more and more opportunities for corporations to use their economic power through the legal system. We see corporations suing citizens who dare to complain about their waste being dumped into rivers. We see the current government about to reinstate measures against secondary boycotts that can and will be used against environmental and community groups organising boycotts for community reasons. We see people being stripped of their power even to take an issue to court, while those with substantial funds can take actions against individuals and voluntary community groups. This is not appropriate. It is not fair and we do not believe it is right that our amendment would allow anyone to take up a breach of this act or the EP act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have heard that some people wonder why we are making an exception for airports in the general measures for taking legal action on the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. It is our legal advice that the other act would still contain requirements that a party must show they are aggrieved and that they have been harmed. I do not think it should be there in the Environment Protection <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> (Impact of Proposals) Act. However, this is not the place to amend that act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to establish here the fact that anyone should be able to take legal action on breach of environmental law. That is particularly important in regard to the environment. Taking legal action against the government and lessee will not be a small thing. It will be a major challenge, probably costly and time consuming and I doubt very much whether anyone would take such an action casually or mischievously. It is also a challenge that is unlikely to be taken without a reasonable chance of winning against a great imbalance of economic and political power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that anyone&mdash;an ordinary person, a community group, a group of councils or whatever&mdash;should be able to call for a remedy for a breach of this act or of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act, which would protect the environment. Again, this measure would be consistent with the consumer protection measures of the Trade Practices Act. I think it is a reasonably good model to use in terms of the impact of a private sector operator on the community and things a community or sectors of the community value.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an inclusive measure. It allows anyone to initiate legal action if they believe there is a breach of the airports act or the environment protection act. It is not open-ended and requires an accuser to prove their case. Court action does not automatically stop a development, although the courts may issue an injunction if they believe there is a case to answer and such an injunction is justified. As with any legal challenge, an unsuccessful challenge is costly in many respects. We do not believe challenges would be made lightly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment would provide the community and other levels of government with some opportunity for redress if a minister chooses to overlook breaches of the act. That is all it does. It gives legal recourse to the community where misuse of ministerial power allows violations of law under the act. It is an element that we would like to see more broadly incorporated into law. We believe that our society would be better for it. We do this in the Airports Bill because it is before us and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3296"> because the agenda of both the current and previous government has often been clearly aligned with the agenda of either the airlines or private sector rather than the wider community.</PARA></SPEECH>

But I must say that that would be, in my view, significantly outweighed by enacting a law here that would simply overturn the question of standing which, of course, is a matter routinely addressed by judicial bodies around Australia. This may well be a matter clarified in the negative by the Acts Interpretation Act or some other act, but I was curious about the reference to any person being able to take this course of action as to whether that person would necessarily even need to be a citizen of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;By way of explanation, I think it is necessary to say that over time,  and in very quick time, we are seeing that environmental legislation of many kinds&mdash;whether it be state or federal legislation or even local ordinances&mdash;is being overridden by the very fast march of competition policy. We see that competition policy has an overarching impact. When bodies, including Commonwealth bodies, are privatised, then much of what happens ends up in corporate law. The interests of the minor shareholders tend to override the interests of the community. It is hard to see any means by which public interest in any true sense of the word is actually being protected. In the past we had people going out from Australia&mdash;certainly from Western Australia&mdash;and saying, `We've got the world's best environmental legislation.' But if there is no way to enforce that environmental legislation, it is hardly worth the paper it is written on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More and more the community are feeling that they ought to have some means of saying to government and government bodies&mdash;in this case we still have some government connection to the land in the federal airports&mdash;`If you've got these rules we should be able to require you to at least stick to them.' It seems that the environment tends to be given a short straw. Corporate laws can be enforced. As I say, the interests of minority shareholders can be enforced. Over time we will see Australian competition and consumer protection taking over regulatory functions more and more, so public interest will very much get a back seat&mdash;if any seat at all. It seems to me that, if we do not start providing this minimal protection, the environment and other human values will not get a guernsey at all. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3297">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this is the wrong way to put this, I look forward to the future and to perhaps being able to work with the opposition and the government to see how this might be placed in legislation so that this protection is given and that eventually we see that such things as the environment are not just things that can be overridden by every other law. If consumer protection is such that a person can have a grievance and the world has not fallen apart by persons being granted such standing, then perhaps we ought to think of similar models for the environment. As I said, if this particular model that I have suggested does not work, I would be very happy to work with either of the parties who are represented here today to see what will work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If, in the end, we move towards the fact that corporate profit is protected and there is some weird view that competition in an imperfect market is protected but other rights are not protected and there is no redress for rules to be enforced, then we are going to be in a very sad and sick society. I will look forward to the future and seeing other proposals coming up. We will, of course, be looking at other models which we will be glad to present in the future for your combined scrutiny.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is continuing to work towards the leasing of the first airports this financial year. My colleague the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) announced on 3 September that the tender process for the sale of leases of Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth airports will commence shortly. The government is, therefore, keen for the Airports Bill 1996 and the Airports (Transitional) Bill 1996 <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3298"> to be passed by the Senate to enable the leasing of airports to proceed. Advertisements calling for the registration of expressions of interest in these airports are expected to be published in national and international newspapers within the next fortnight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The beginning of the airports tender process is another important step in the government's privatisation program. The tender process will be open and is expected to be highly competitive. The Minister for Finance also announced that leasing of Adelaide airport will be deferred pending the completion of a feasibility study into an integrated passenger terminal at Adelaide airport. It is envisaged that this will be completed in early 1997, after which the timing of the sale of Adelaide airport will be revisited.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government recognises that airports are vitally important to the communities and regions which they serve. The government believes that leasing of the major airports will deliver significant benefits to airport users and industry and will enable airports to continue to develop to meet future requirements. The government expects that leasing of the airports will promote efficient airport operations in the interests of transport, tourism and trade. It should also encourage economic development of airports in ways which are responsive to the needs of users and the regions which they serve. The government will encourage airport operators to develop a partnership approach to airport operation and development. This will provide opportunities for participation by airport users as well as state and local governments, local communities and the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cross-ownership provisions and the sales processes will establish an appropriate diversity of ownership of federal airports at the outset. Airport ownership will also be subject to ongoing scrutiny under normal trade practices controls. Of course, the airports will also be subject to restrictions on foreign and airline ownership. The government will welcome outcomes which promote the development of an export oriented Australian airport infrastructure and services industry. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has made every effort to address fully the matters that interested parties, including many senators, have raised on the airport bills. Some of those concerns have been addressed in the amendments to the Airport Bill which the government has moved. The government has responded to others, including through the Senate inquiry and in both houses of the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to emphasise, as I did in the Senate committee hearings, that the Airports Bill 1996 and the Airports (Transitional) Bill 1996 are very sound pieces of legislation. They have been developed over a lengthy period with the benefit of wide consultations with interested parties. They represent a considered balance between the need to have regard to the reasonable commercial interests of private airport lessees and the need to protect airport users and the community. The regulatory framework contained in the Airports Bill contains substantial protection of the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I conclude I would like to emphasise briefly the environmental protections included in the bill. These include requirements for airport operators to develop and implement approved environment strategies. The Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 will also apply. As well, the existing Commonwealth legislation, like the Endangered Species Act 1992 and the Australian Heritage Commission Act, will continue to apply at the leased airports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As senators may be aware, the government has consulted with relevant parties on airport pricing over the past few weeks and will enter shortly into consultations on the regulations to be made under the Airports Bill on matters such as airport environment and building controls. The government recognises the interests of the states and territories in these matters and will consult closely with them. I certainly commend the bills to the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Obviously there has been a level of debate on this bill in the committee stage. Unfortunately, my ability to participate in the amendments is limited to the amount of time that we have and the amount of issues that we are required to deal with. I can recall that I <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3299"> was trying to follow the Telstra hearings as well as the industrial relations hearings during the non-sitting periods. It is extremely difficult to be in several places simultaneously. My non-appearance or even `non-efforts' to hear the inquiry by Telelink are not related to any lack of interest in the issue. Honourable senators will realise that I have followed this issue with great interest over some time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is unfortunate that many people in Australia still are not aware of the fact that these issues will affect them. It is not just about Sydney. It is about any FAC airport in Australia. The issues can be dealt with by the privatisation of airports. They can be dealt with by regulation. I do not think the aspects of public benefit and so on are properly protected. Nothing that has occurred with this legislation, even the improvements to the legislation, has made me feel that I should be supporting this bill to privatise Federal Airports Corporation airports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have never felt that creating a private monopoly is more efficient than continuing with a public monopoly. Anyone who lives in Perth would realise that there is not a great deal of choice when you want to fly to London other than Perth airport. You might be able to go from Broome but you will not go very far in terms of Europe or other places in the world. So basically somebody will be pocketing the profits rather than putting the profits back into the public entity. I fail to see how in the end we will all benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But that is beside the point. There are some other issues I would like to canvass. They include some of the issues I have talked about in terms of the biota surrounding airports. It has been brought to my attention that part of the problem that has been perceived by communities is a lack of environmental management. Recently I was escorted around Perth airport by representatives from the Federal Airports Corporation. I asked some questions with regard to oil seepage that I had been advised of in an area in a marshalling yard just outside the airport. The environmental officer for the Federal Airports Corporation indicated that he had no knowledge of this. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It occurred to me to wonder who was responsible for environmental management of buffer zones. If it was not the Federal Airports Corporation, perhaps it was the federal government, but who would be their representative on the spot to actually manage that land? You cannot expect the management to take place by people who are not there, and a day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day management or yearly management seems to be lacking in these areas. Even if there are community volunteers to assist in the management of remnant bushland or buffer zones or wetlands, they need some assistance at least to have their costs reimbursed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Campbell, at the beginning of the debate, mentioned that he recognised that Perth airport bushland was one of those areas which, although it is considered to be a significant area of remnant bushland, is in bad need of management. Even putting a fence around a piece of remnant bushland is no guarantee that that area will be managed. I would like some sort of guidance from the minister as to who is responsible for management of buffer zones, remnant bushland and wetlands, for instance, around airports and what guarantees we have that those areas will actually be managed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I was cynical, I might say that sometimes, when there is pressure for development, it might be easy for the lessee simply to allow an area of remnant bushland to degrade. For instance, you could allow off&hyphen;road vehicles or fires or rubbish dumping and, within a short time, you could argue that the area no longer needed care or saving or protection. What duty of care is there of lessees and, if it is not the lessees who have that duty of care, whose is it?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As is customary, I wish to acknowledge the support of the people who have provided advice or assistance in my life to date in the Labor movement. They know who they are because I thanked some of them a few weeks ago in public in Perth. It  is appropriate, however, to single out one person who offered me the opportunity to work in the trade union movement many years ago. That man was Jim Maher, a former national president of the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association. He also held a number of senior and influential positions in the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1981 he offered me the opportunity to assume senior office in the SDA in Western Australia at a relatively young age. He guaranteed no success&mdash;simply offered a vision of the likely growth of that state and said that a job needed to be done. He offered me the chance to participate in the building of an organisation from the ground up and to be part of the dynamic growth of service industry unions in the Australian economy. As later events were to demonstrate, that was no mean offer. I thank him wholeheartedly for his support and help over the intervening period and wish him and his wife, Fran, well in their retirement.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my own case, I studied law at the University of Adelaide and graduated in 1981. After graduation I chose to pursue a career in the SDA, because it offered the ability to give practical expression to a number of longstanding interests. Those interests were, and are: law, economics, politics and history. Indeed, I took the opportunity to pursue some postgraduate study in economics and public policy in the United States in the years 1993 and 1994. If I had my time over, even with the benefit of 15 years hindsight, I would make the same decision again without reservation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My family background is typical of many people who grew up in the outer suburbs of our major cities. My parents had few assets and many demands which did not shrink as their family grew to six children. Occasionally I read press or newspaper stories of the golden days of the 1950s and 1960s. Australia was apparently a land of milk and honey. I grew up in that period and have no memory of that fabled land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Behind my family fence it was a time of insufficient earnings, mean comfort and poor to nonexistent public facilities. It was a struggle to keep family and home together. One of my clearest memories is of my mother waiting impatiently for the quarterly child endowment cheque doled out by the then government to fund purchases of school uniforms and other essential items. I do not, however, paint any extreme picture of unmitigated hardship, simply one of constant struggle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both my mother and father, for different reasons, placed great emphasis on the value of education, hard work and personal effort for individuals to make the most of their talents. Equally important was the expectation that individuals had an obligation to give something back to their community. Both of them were people who acted out their principles, and I know they are proud to see all of their children successful in their respective careers and professions. In particular, I have been touched at their pleasure in my election as a senator in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I see the two big issues for public policy in the coming decade as reconciling the imperative for economic change and the natural <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3305"> desire for personal and family security. Government is the only mechanism we have that can hope to reconcile the potential for conflict between these two equally pressing imperatives and so avoid further polarisation of the Australian community. In terms of people's desire for individual and family security, the actions of the previous Labor governments in this area of family payments and family assistance packages were worthy initiatives indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this context, the policy initiative of the current government in providing tax assistance to single&hyphen;income families with dependent children is an interesting development. It seems to suggest a heightened role for the states in the provision of assistance to families and is something worthy of further study. This is because the form of the payment reflects economic recognition of the partner in a single&hyphen;income family with primary responsibility for dependent children. Personally I have no quarrel with this new direction. However, I do not think it should be at the expense of other family support programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suspect this particular payment will cause much discussion in a range of circles in forthcoming years. It will be interesting to note how a government responds to the inevitable requests for its extension in future years.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The soft option of cuts in other programs will not be available forever. Our side of the house well knows this because for many years we looked everywhere for the painless cut. Unfortunately, they did not exist then and they do not exist now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second theme I briefly wish to address is the absolute need for our economy to grow and expand in future years. A lot of the reform initiated by the former Labor government in the period 1983 to 1991 will bear rich fruit in the next few years. I suspect the productivity growth alone will surprise a lot of commentators. If those policy prescriptions had been maintained, Australians might not continue to be satisfied with achieving the modest growth outcomes of western European or Anglo-Saxon economies but might start to understand that our country has the potential to match the economic outcomes consistently <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> delivered by our Asian neighbours over the last generation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government agenda&mdash;including micro-economic reform, the reduction in tariffs, the emphasis on growth in manufactures, and the obsession with an export orientation&mdash;were correct. I make no apology for endorsing the overdue modernisation of the Australian economy in any way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The years in a private sector union left me with an appreciation of the dynamics of that sector in our economy. I am not aware of any superior system to that of our mixed economy. That necessarily means a continuing role for government. Generally, the mechanics of price allocation as a determinant of outcomes is satisfactory. There needs to be good reason for government intervention in the marketplace, and in no way do I advocate a return to the dreary days of yesterday's economy. My earlier comments on my own upbringing bear witness to my attitude concerning the sad state of affairs that prevailed in the 1950s and 1960s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the market is not God and government has a role to play, not only in mitigating the harm occasioned by efficiency but also in stimulating industries which show clear potential for national competitive advantage in the future. In that context, our country could usefully profit from rigorous study of a number of Asian economies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The World Bank has indeed done that study and, in 1993, concluded that the ongoing growth of east Asian economies was due to the use of both fundamentals and interventionist policies by government. By fundamentals, the World Bank said that macro-economic management was unusually good in providing a framework for private investment. It was a focus on policies that, first, encouraged high levels of savings; second, provided education policies that equipped students with the ability to enter industry; and, third, provided agricultural policies that stressed productivity&mdash;all contributed to sustained high levels of growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bank, however, also conceded these policies did not tell the whole story. The bank went on to observe that in most of these economies, in one form or another, the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3306"> government intervened to foster development&mdash;in some cases the development of specific industries. In saying so openly, the bank acknowledged its own violation of neo-classical theory and went on to conclude:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Government intervention resulted in higher and more equal growth than otherwise would have occurred.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>So according to the World Bank there is a critical role for government intervention in the development of firms, industries, sectors and markets. We on this side have never doubted the wisdom of that conclusion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue of industry policy and industry development is out of favour at the moment. Instead, the government has an alternative strategy of debt reduction, balanced budgets, transparent accounting and minimal social programs. If those policies are successful in giving us full employment, low inflation, low interest rates, a balanced current account and high growth, I will be flabbergasted and delighted. I have no doubt that on their own those policies are inadequate to give the Australian economy a period of sustained economic growth of above three per cent per annum. In the final analysis, those policies will result in massive unemployment and the undoing of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is nothing inherently wrong with balanced budgets, reducing borrowings to a minimum or even transparent accounting. In most circumstances, they are desirable options. However, this government will never achieve higher and more equal growth simultaneously, because its members fail to heed part two of the advice of the World Bank concerning government intervention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope to be a member of the next Labor government, which will place more emphasis on this aspect of public policy. In my time in the Senate, I intend to maintain an interest in the areas of trade and industry policy. I have also been asked to take an interest in tax and defence associated areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This side of the Senate is currently suffering that most terrible of punishments. That punishment is rejection. Rejection, however, can be temporary and is very different indeed from irrelevance. The next few years are times of opportunity. The opportunity to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> revisit our roots, the chance to plan our future and the need to develop policies that guide our country are tasks I face with relish and anticipation. I know many of my colleagues share that sentiment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In closing, I wish to publicly acknowledge the role of my wife, Fran Marsh, and two daughters, Gabrielle, eight, and Georgia, six. The travel in this business breaks your back, particularly when most flights are of five or seven hours duration. I have been doing that travel since 1980 and, in recent years, up to 30 or 40 times a year for a range of negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the interesting consequences of enterprise bargaining in both national and medium sized companies is that it has centralised the negotiation process more often than not in both Melbourne and Sydney. That was an unwelcome development for those of us who lived on the western side of our continent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The end of the week is the best time for me, as it is the time I am welcomed home and find comfort. So to Fran, I thank you for your support and our two children. Finally, I thank my colleagues for their attendance in the Senate today and I look forward to many years of robust participation in the issues that face our nation. Thank you.</PARA>

<STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(5.19 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Madam President. In rising to give my maiden speech, may I first say that I regard it as a great honour to have become a member of the Senate. I have very great respect for the place of the Senate in the Australian constitution and its role in our process of government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3307"> <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is a vast and varied country with great differences between the regions, some of which, while having great economic potential, have low populations. Because of that, I believe that a system of government recognising the need for regional representation is essential for the continued develop ment and good government of this country at both state and federal levels. I was pleased that the High Court of Australia, in rejecting the recent Western Australian ALP challenge to the electoral boundaries in Western Australia, held that the concept of regional representation was implicitly recognised in the constitution as a feature of the Australian system of government, which, needless to say, in the federal sphere is provided by the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also a great honour to have the opportunity of representing my own great state of Western Australia in the federal parliament and, in my case, to represent here in Canberra the north of Western Australia. The north of Western Australia makes a massive contribution to the national economy. For example, the Pilbara mining industry alone contributes 10 per cent of Australia's merchandise exports. Yet, notwithstanding this, the north of Western Australia has never had any effective representation here in Canberra, much less been represented by a person who comes from the area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having lived in the Pilbara for the last 22&half; years, been Mayor of Port Hedland for the last three years, been chairman of the Pilbara ward of the Country Shire Councils Association, a member of the board of the Pilbara Development Commission and closely involved in the formulation of WA Liberal Party policy for the north since the early 1980s, I believe I am well qualified to give the people of the North&hyphen;West and the issues which concern them a powerful voice here in Canberra, and give the north effective input into the federal political process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that traditionally in a maiden speech one should say who one is, where one comes from in the sense of what relevant life experience one brings to the Senate, and what one's beliefs are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am a fourth generation Australian. My great&hyphen;grandmother, Alice Murray, was born&mdash;as Senator Abetz will be pleased to know&mdash;in Van Diemen's Land in 1839. My grandfather brought my part of the Eggleston family to the west in the 1890s. I grew up in Busselton in the south&hyphen;west of Western Australia and I went to school and university in Perth.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was a medical student at UWA and at that time I joined the Liberal Party and became what is now described as a `student politician', being involved in the UWA Guild Council, NUAUS as it was then known, and my national faculty bureau, the AMSA or Australian Medical Students Association. I then spent four years in the UK and, after returning to Perth, to fulfil a long&hyphen;held curiosity, I went to the North&hyphen;West&mdash;supposedly for six months, but, as is the story of so many people in the north, that six months became 22 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The life experiences I bring to the Senate are, most importantly, having lived in the north of this country, having been a medical GP at a time of great change in Australian medicine, having been involved in local government at a fairly senior level and serving as a member of a state regional development commission, the Pilbara Development Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to say a little about general practice medicine, which is undergoing something of a crisis of identity at the moment. As a recent ANU survey showed, many GPs are disillusioned and frustrated. As things have evolved over the last 25 years, the status and scope of work performed by GPs have diminished. The income of GPs has fallen, both in absolute and relative terms to that of their specialist colleagues, so that today many GPs, especially in the metropolitan areas, are genuinely struggling to meet the cost of providing the equipment necessary to enable them to give good service. Although reassuring noises are constantly made about general practice medicine remaining the cornerstone of Australian medicine, the contemporary role of the GP has never been satisfactorily defined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If general practice is to be maintained in this country, it is important that the role of the GP within the Australian medical system should be defined and adequately funded because able and intelligent young men and women are not going to enter a discipline which does not have a definite role in the scheme of things, as well as offering job satisfaction, challenge and reasonable rewards. This is a matter which should concern the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3308"> Senate because the community makes a large investment in the training of doctors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the great problems of Australian medicine is that of getting medical practitioners to go to small country towns. The reasons for this are complex and not only related to working conditions but also to social factors such as education and shopping facilities and the fact that doctors' wives tend to be city girls who do not relate well to living in country towns for long periods. For some time I have thought there was an analogy to be drawn between the health and education services under which young teachers are sent out to country schools for a few years after graduation. It occurs to me that one solution to the problem of providing adequate medical services in small rural communities might be to establish community health centres in areas of need where not one, but two or three salaried doctors&mdash;to ensure reasonable duty rosters&mdash;would work as part of a team of health professionals which might include a visiting physiotherapist, occupational therapist and social worker.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I strongly support the endeavours of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, of which I am a fellow, to improve GP medicine through various means, including more effective political representation in the forums of medicine. I congratulate the college on the excellence of its innovative continuing medical education programs which are recognised world wide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I spent eight years in local government, which I found to be an interesting experience, encompassing a wide range of activities from running an arts centre and privatising a busy airport, to dealing with tourism projects and regional development issues, as well as administering a HACC program and an aged persons' village. There is no doubt that the scope of local government is growing and, while I do not agree with the vision that some participants in the field have for the role of local government in the future in terms of local government superseding state governments, I do believe that the role local government plays in delivering services to the Australian community should have formal <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> recognition in the constitution, as well as more secure funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The North&hyphen;West is that area of Western Australia roughly north of the 26th parallel encompassing the Gascoyne, Pilbara and Kimberley regions and represents about 50 per cent of the land area of Western Australia or half a million square miles. While the North&hyphen;West is a vast and ancient land, the modern north is, in many ways, a microcosm of Australia's future. By this I mean that the population is young and multicultural, there being a wide diversity of nationalities and ethnic groups, including some with close ties to Asia, not only in the old towns of Broome and Carnarvon with their Japanese and Chinese links but also in the new towns such as South Hedland where 10 per cent of the population are Malay Muslims. Furthermore, the economy of the north is export oriented and increasingly linked to the tiger economies of Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said in my introduction, the North&hyphen;West makes a truly massive contribution to the national economy, and the great powerhouse of the north is the Pilbara. The development of the Pilbara region into one of the world's greatest mineral producing areas over the last 30 years has been a remarkable success story. The Pilbara economy is based on iron ore, natural gas, petroleum and solar salt production. The Pilbara now produces some $7 billion worth of minerals per annum generating, as I have already said, 10 per cent of Australia's merchandising exports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the years, concern has been expressed that Australia was no more than a quarry for the steel mills of Asia. I am pleased to say that secondary processing is now beginning to occur. Plants are being constructed to process iron ore into hot briquettes which are the feedstock for electric arc furnaces, which is the new way steel is made. It is now quite possible that the future will see such steel mills being established in the Pilbara, which will see the fulfilment of Sir Charles Court's great plan&mdash;he once told me off, in no uncertain terms, for calling it a dream&mdash;to see steel production in the Pilbara become a reality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having returned today from the Pilbara conference which was held in Karratha on <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3309"> Monday and Tuesday, I can tell senators there are many other possibilities for large scale industrial development in the Pilbara, such as the establishment of a petrochemical industry, to mention but one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is educational for the Senate to know why it has taken 30 years for secondary downstream processing to begin in the Pilbara. The reasons why secondary processing is only now becoming possible are these. Firstly, it is because of the previously appalling industrial relations record in the Pilbara, which only improved when the unions came to understand in the early 1980s that the Japanese could go to Brazil as an alternative source of supply for their iron ore and that there was no question of industrial problems occurring in Brazil, for obvious reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, automation has reduced the price of labour, which is a major disincentive to further development. The Pilbara 21 study of a few years ago revealed that it cost about $65,000 per annum to employ a skilled tradesperson in the Pilbara compared to about $30, 000 for the same person in Perth. While the cost of labour has not come down, automation means fewer people are employed, with a dramatic fall in the total cost of labour to industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, the deregulation of the energy market in Western Australia has substantially reduced the price of energy, so that now the Pilbara offers the lowest priced gas in the South&hyphen;East Asian area. The Pilbara is now the nation's leading producer of petroleum products, the value of which was $3.77 billion in 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To the north of the Pilbara is the Kimberley region. The principal drivers of economic activity in the Kimberley are the mining, tourism, agriculture, pastoral, pearling and fishing industries, with the total Kimberley economy earning the nation about $890 million per annum. Irrigated agriculture at Kununurra on the Ord River has grown rapidly in recent years, capitalising on out&hyphen;of&hyphen;season markets in Australia's southern capital cities and developing international markets.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Currently, the annual production of agricultural crops in the Kimberley is valued at about $42 million, coming chiefly from the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Ord River irrigation area, which is set for major expansion as another 65,000 hectares is due to be added to the irrigated area in the near future, chiefly to grow sugar, the yields of which on the Ord are much, much higher than those in Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am delighted with the success of the Ord River scheme and salute people such as Bill Withers, Alma Petherick and Howard Young who have been there from the beginning and have been through all the trials and tribulations, because they are genuine, modern day pioneers who worked hard and endured great setbacks before they enjoyed the success that they do today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third region in the north&hyphen;west is the Gascoyne, which is centred on Carnarvon and extends to the eastern goldfields. In the Gascoyne, apart from the mining and pastoral industries, the seafood industry is important and provides over 60 per cent of Western Australia's prawns and scallops, with major export markets in Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tourism is the great growth industry of the north, with the icons being the Ningaloo Reef at Exmouth, the Karijini National Park in the Pilbara, and the spectacular beauty of the North Kimberley area. Broome, of course, has become a major holiday resort. The northern tourist industry is already generating about $200 million a year and the industry is only in its infancy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thus it can be seen that the economy of the north is not only truly massive, but it is diverse and it has come a long way from what was once the stereotype image of stockmen and cattle yards as typifying the north&hyphen;west of Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I first went to the north in the 1970s, the Pilbara was regarded as being marginally less remote than the far side of the moon. But that is not the case anymore. Whereas once the population of the north was transient, many people now remain in the north because they find the weather congenial, the lifestyle pleasant and the economic prospects much better than in most other areas of Australia. A generation of young people have grown up in the north who simply regard the north as home. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3310">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I want to place on record in the Senate is that the North&hyphen;West is now simply another part of regional Australia, albeit a region which makes a very substantial contribution to the national economy, and to remind the Senate that the people of the north expect to be given due consideration when policies affecting the north are under discussion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A good example of this not being done was the fringe benefits tax, which was designed to tax benefits paid to corporate executives in Sydney and Melbourne, but the fringe benefits tax has had a devastating impact across the whole of northern Australia. This could have been avoided if allowance had been made for differences in regional requirements, so that housing, meals, airfares and airconditioning subsidies could have been classified as necessities required to attract staff to remote areas, rather than luxuries to be taxed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The impact of the fringe benefits tax is still being felt in terms of loss of population and restricted development in the north. There remains a need for further rationalisation of this tax. Senators may be interested to learn that the Pilbara Development Commission is currently doing a study designed to demonstrate how much revenue the federal government has lost through the cancellation of development projects in the north caused by the impact of the fringe benefits tax. When this report is completed, I assure you I will be tabling it for the record in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since 1982, I have attended a number of northern Australia development conferences in the north of Western Australia, Queensland and the Northern Territory. To those who attended these conferences, it was very apparent that the issues across the north were very similar. I look forward to working with my colleagues from Queensland and the Northern Territory&mdash;and I include Senator Bob Collins&mdash;in jointly pursuing the interests of the north while I am a member of the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning to my beliefs, senators will not be surprised to learn that I am a committed federalist. I believe that states and state governments have a valid and ongoing role in looking after the interests of regional Australia and that the federal system provides the best formula for the good government of this <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> country. In terms of political philosophy, I am a classical liberal. I believe in the individual and the right of the individual to conduct their affairs without undue interference from the heavy hand of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">True to classic liberalism, I believe society should provide for the needy and I believe that government should provide community infrastructure. In my case, I believe there is a community service dimension to government&mdash;meaning, among other things, that equitable community services should be provided for our citizens, wherever they live, including with the objective of lessening the impact of the tyranny of distance which has been so much a part of the Australian ethos.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a classical liberal, I look to the future and do not unnecessarily cling to the past. I accept the need for well ordered change, which in my case includes supporting a purely Australian institution for the office of a national head of state and the conversion of Australia to a republic. I am not anti&hyphen;British and I do not deny the value of our British heritage. I do not want to change our parliamentary system, nor would I want Australia to leave the British Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very proud of being an Australian, proud of what Australia stands for in terms of political ideology, if I might put it that way. That deep pride has been engendered by the knowledge that Australia is a land to which people came&mdash;people who for the most part were not from privileged backgrounds and had little in the way of material possessions, but they are people who, through their diligence and the opportunities Australia offered them, have enjoyed success.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In contrast, the monarchy is an institution representing a system which divided people into social classes and is the very antithesis of the democratic and egalitarian values for which Australia stands. One may ask whether the breaking of the symbolic tie to the British monarchy is such a big step to take.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the legal world, a similar step has already been taken. In the mid-1970s, Australian appeals to the Privy Council in London were abolished so the High Court of Australia became the final arbiter in Australian legal matters. Many Australians see the breaking of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3311"> the symbolic tie to the British monarchy as very much akin to the abolition of legal appeals to the Privy Council and, just as Australia has taken charge of its affairs in the world of the law, they believe the time has come for Australia to take ownership of the institution of our national head of state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senators will be interested to learn that three years ago at the 1993 Western Australian state conference of the Liberal Party only 55.5 per cent of delegates voted in a formal ballot for a motion confirming support for the monarchy. In other words, 44.5 per cent of delegates were not prepared to vote for the retention of the present system. That is worth noting because the Western Australian division of the Liberal Party is regarded as being more conservative than most.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Conservative lawyers such as Sir Harry Gibbs have made much of the difficulty of drafting a set of words for a republic constitution which would recreate the balances and political stability enjoyed by Australia under the present arrangements. Without doubt, the task will be complex, but I have long suspected more was being made of this difficulty than needed to be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To me, it has never been credible for monarchists to argue that, in a nation which has produced as many brilliantly clear thinking lawyers as Australia, a constitution could not be written which protected and preserved the rights of the Australian people, entrenched responsible parliamentary government under a prime minister and cabinet and created an institution for head of state not only having clearly defined and limited powers but also embodying formulae for the democratic means of resolution of crises should the good government of the Commonwealth be in jeopardy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dubious lawyers can take comfort from the knowledge that the Irish have successfully written such a constitution, as have Germany and India, among other nations. With the passing of Paul Keating from the political stage, I hope the debate on the republic can be conducted in a more objective and thoughtful manner. The republic was never Keating's republic.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to Professor Geoffrey Bolton of Edith Cowan University in Perth, there has been discussion about whether Australia should convert to republican status since the 1850s, and Henry Lawson's mother, Louisa, for example, was the editor of a pro-republican newsletter in Sydney towards the end of the last century. Now in the 1990s, just as in the 1890s, I believe there is a renewed sense of the need to define our national identity and to express that identity in the institution of the office of our national head of state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I look forward to contributing to the debate on constitutional change which, apart from the issues I have mentioned, I would like to see include a review of Commonwealth&hyphen;state financial relationships and the role of the High Court. It is my belief there is also a need to give consideration to constitutional protection of the civil, political and human rights of our citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam President, I conclude with some thanks. Firstly, I express appreciation to my parents and family in general and the many friends I have made along the way. I also wish to thank those long-term players in the Liberal Party in the north who have supported me, including Greg Kneale, Maxine Middap, David Chapman and Joy West. As Senator Ellison will no doubt somewhat ruefully confirm, Greg Kneale, I and the powerful Kalgoorlie north division have had some famous victories in the forums of the Liberal Party in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year was not an easy year for the Liberal Party in Western Australia. The preselection for this Senate seat, or for the Senate team, was a drawn out, hard fought process extending over 4&half; months. In winning this Senate seat, I was supported by a broad coalition of the members of the state council of the Western Australian Liberal Party, which no doubt in part reflects the fact that I have been around the Western Australian Liberal Party for a long time, but it can also be said to have been a statement that the Liberal Party in Western Australia was taking a different, more inclusive, more cohesive and less divisive pathway.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I stand to speak from a position of great privilege here today. The first and most obvious privilege is to be elected to the Senate. I have accepted that privilege knowing that it is a huge responsibility to act honourably, to be honest and to make good judgments for all Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come here from a privileged background. I have never known what it is to be unemployed. I left school at year 11, I walked into a job and I negotiated my conditions and I chose my own direction. I entered university as a mature age student and my degree in teaching was paid for by general revenue. Without my university education, I would not be here today. As much as any other factor, my teaching career has shaped my views on social justice and on the role of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I first taught in a school which took students who were not privileged: students with learning difficulties and behaviour problems; students whose fathers were in prison; students whose families had been murdered in front of their eyes; students whose first language was not English and whose culture at home was very different from the war zone of the schoolyard in inner Melbourne; students who were good with their hands but could not read properly, if at all; students who were disturbed; students who for various reasons had stopped learning at some time in primary school; and students whose parents had no reason to value learning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was a Catholic technical school, the last in Melbourne and now closed. It closed because educating such students is expensive. You cannot teach thirty&hyphen;five 14-year-olds metalwork all at once, at least not these kids. You cannot teach these kids without support services for their teachers. You cannot teach these kids without occasionally providing <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> them with textbooks. These are the kids who will grow up to be the most cynical about politicians, and you will not find them on a bus coming to Canberra to see how parliament works.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am proud that I was educated in a state primary school and a state high school. If I achieve little more in my parliamentary career than to improve the lot of our education system, I will be satisfied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind the Senate that a truly egalitarian, prosperous and healthy society is one which above all else does not discriminate against children because their parents are unwilling or unable to send them to a wealthy school. I hope that one day parents will choose public education because it is the best.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Funding for schools in Australia has dropped 25 per cent in real terms in the last 20 years. My commitment to Australian children is to argue for a reversal of this decline. I believe that a strong education system starts with a strong state education system. Parents and teachers are deeply worried about the decline, particularly in primary schooling. In Victoria I am ashamed to say that class sizes have actually risen in primary schools. Poor schools get poorer with the increasing dependence of schools on fundraising and sponsorship for the most basic education. Those least willing or able to court the corporate sector miss out as a result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On a personal level, I can say that I am privileged to have a generous and supportive partner, a man who is principled and abhors injustice, someone who will not much like coming home to an empty house. My parents are proud, if a little surprised, that I am here today. What is an art teacher doing in a place like this? Party politics was never discussed at home when I was a child, but community politics and concern for themselves came naturally to my family's notion of its civic responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another reason why I am here is because of my passionate belief that women should share equally in decision making. I am immensely proud to be part of a strong team of women, so ably led by women, and I am proud to represent a political party which finds its female majority unremarkable.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3313">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I entered real politics as a councillor in Port Melbourne in 1992. For the first time in Port Melbourne's history there were more women in the chamber than men. The number of Victorian councils was reduced by almost two-thirds. In many metropolitan councils women had won 50 per cent of the seats. But more than 80 per cent of the state government appointed commissioners sent to replace elected councillors were men. Democracy was removed in Victoria so local government could be converted into businesses with customers and privatised services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have visited many country towns in Victoria over the past two years and I have watched in horror at the way in which rural communities have borne the brunt of government obsession with the dogma of the level playing field, the notion that the private sector necessarily does it better and the idea that all endeavour is improved but in a competitive environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Cooperation, community responsibility and public interest have been put aside in the name of privatisation&mdash;that panacea for ailing economies in which the Telstras of this world are transformed into core&hyphen;focused, streamlined, private corporations, downsized and ready for competition. As a teacher, I know that some children respond well to competition, but I also know that every child cannot win. Some kids never win. Does this mean that we put them on the scrapheap of unemployment?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Winning the prize for being the first and only nation to remove protection for its primary products has not excited our farmers. Chicken producers fail to see the logic in GATT if it means we must import poultry from other countries where Newcastle disease is rampant. Our chicken meat industry is one of the most efficient in the world and free from this disease. So is our native bird population so far.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Primary producers have cause to be sceptical about promises of support for the bush. The rush to remove public utilities from country towns has been breathtaking. In rural Victoria, the state government has privatised or closed down electricity and gas utilities, schools, hospitals, railways and regional veterinary <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> laboratories. A veterinary scientist at the height of her career is now on the treadmill of labour market programs, at least until they, too, are removed. She is retraining in computers and office administration. There is the teacher in the country who picks fruit because the literacy program in his school has been cut. I am always shocked at the way in which those with the training, the skills and the experience of some of our best are laid waste in the name of competition, restructure, downsizing and reform. I find it scandalous that we do not ask what happened to the work that they once did.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Victoria has been a model competition state. The state government forces councils to put to tender between 80 and 100 per cent of their services. Where once Victorian councils formed regional organisations and shared resources, they are now competitors bidding for one another's contracts. Absurd and anomalous situations are emerging, like the council staff business unit which wins a Meals on Wheels contract from a neighbouring council but loses its own tender for its own service. The big end of town in Melbourne and the larger regional centres are reaping the economic benefits of winning contracts at the expense of small councils and small business. The Victorian state government has such a strong commitment to competition that it has legislated to guarantee its success. Councils are forced to cut rates by 20 per cent and they have capped this rate for the foreseeable future. Competition, it seems, must be seen to be working, regardless of the consequences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I raised the matter of competition policy because of the effect on rural economies&mdash;and it can be devastating, from what I have seen. Jobs go and families go and they are not replaced. There is a slow realisation that governments are acting on the supposition that the family farm has a limited future and is no longer competitive. I would argue that Australian cities are already too big and country towns already too small to sustain viable rural communities. We are told that the hope for the bush is in mining, woodchipping and tourism. We are told that reduction of the deficit and a complete overhaul of our system <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3314"> of industrial relations will lead to lower interest rates and make farmers more competitive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Farmers have pushed their land to the limit already in order to be competitive. Many have gone over that limit with disastrous consequences. Dairy farmers are producing more milk, but the results of their flood irrigation and their fertilisers and the fact that their cows graze right up to the water's edge leads to waterways clogged up with silt and poisoned by algae. Farmers downstream have high water tables and paddocks laid waste by salt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Landcare groups have mushroomed around Australia, but this awareness, this desire to reverse the degradation of once fertile land, has been a mixed blessing. Governments have seen the emergence of these groups as an opportunity to cut their own services. Extension workers in departments of agriculture, parks and management and salinity control have been made redundant. Meanwhile, landcare groups lose funding for their coordinators in favour of other newer groups with more lengthy and more inventive grant applications. The problems landcare groups seek to address were created over the last 100 years and they will not be solved by short&hyphen;term fixes. They will not be solved, either, unless farming becomes viable. I am told that 80 per cent of farming income in Victoria is now earned off&hyphen;farm and the average age of farmers is more than 60. These are statistics which suggest that rural communities are in crisis and, whilst this is the case, the land will not be restored.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another major factor in shaping my views and leading me to the Australian Democrats has been the damage we in this country have wrought on the environment. Much of this has come about because of the notion that development and growth, no matter how insensitive, is fundamentally worthwhile. Bayside was a large industrial site on the seafront in the heart of working class Port Melbourne, where I come from. Its proposed transformation into a haven for those wealthy enough to have their yachts moored at their back garden was typical of the cargo cult mentality of development. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Developers and governments were prepared to overlook the pollution of the site, but locals could recall the days when the disposal of toxic waste directly onto the soil was commonplace. Bayside's proposed 40&hyphen;storey office and hotel towers would have offered spectacular views across the bay. The streets would be private and the public would not have access to the foreshore. It would be a walled city&mdash;a modern cross between Dubrovnik and Venice&mdash;but the seven kilometres of canals would capture seawater loaded with nutrients from the nearby river mouth: a perfect environment for the growth of toxic blue&hyphen;green algae. The arrogance with which the developer and the governments ignored local anger was enough to stir the dead. It was locals, not governments, which eventually forced a site clean&hyphen;up, and their action, together with the recession we had to have, won out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The battle against opportunism and greed can never really be said to be won. Our coast environment is precious. Not only will the next few years see an ever&hyphen;increasing threat from ill conceived development; there will also be pressure to take more fish, to drill for oil and to regard the sea, like the land, as a limitless resource. The reluctance to protect the marine environment means the waters in our bays and ports are being strangled by weeds and pests introduced in ballast water. Governments have not acted on recommendations. They  hold the view that the problem is too difficult and not important enough to increase the cost of shipping and not important enough for us to demand international action&mdash;too late, anyway. Whilst reports fill the shelves, more and more marine rabbits enter our waterways, finding environments in which they can thrive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I enter this place with very high expectations. I want to see the natural world protected. I want to see full employment, an environmentally sustainable economy, justice and equity, cooperation and harmony, world peace and disarmament, true economic and constitutional independence and reconciliation with indigenous Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope the Senate can be a place of genuine democracy, a place which might one day set <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3315"> aside the rhetoric and take a less partisan approach to decision making. I look forward to the day when women will cross the floor in solidarity and when the strength of argument regularly influences the vote. Madam President, I look forward to my term of office.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam President, democracy is founded on the principle of mutual respect and on the expectation of reciprocal dignity. This building and this chamber are designed and built to enhance the dignity of parliament and to express respect for the institutions and processes of our democracy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But dignity is neither the preserve nor the reward of office. Rather, it is the duty of office, because it is the fundamental right of every person to be treated with dignity, whoever and wherever they may be, throughout the three phases of our lives: firstly, in our youth; secondly, in our work; and, thirdly, in our retirement. To strive to do anything else, is to suffer from delusions of self&hyphen;grandeur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The need to have dignity and to be treated with dignity is the special element that sets us apart from all the other species on this planet. We are something special and, as such, should treat ourselves and our fellow humans in a way which gives dignity. Dignity is not a commodity to be bought, sold or traded. It is an inalienable right. Unfortunately today, too much time, effort, energy and money seems to be devoted to stripping away dignity rather than maintaining or enhancing it. It is for this very reason that I became involved with the pursuit of social justice in both the trade union and political arena&mdash;to do what I can to maintain and enhance the dignity of people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My particular focus has been to help those less fortunate than I. Whilst I came from humble surrounds, foremost in the ethos of my parents was the impeccable value of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> helping and serving others. I have inherited that ethos.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In reflecting on the great changes and advances made in our society over the last 200 years, one factor remains constant&mdash;the need for the dignity of people. There were two industrial revolutions which I wish to briefly refer to that have profoundly affected humanity. The first was in the early 1800s. It was a time of dramatic change. It saw: one, a greater rate of wealth creation than at any other time; two, the nature of work and the way it was done changed forever; and, three, the organisation of society changed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">None of this was or is intrinsically bad. The creation of wealth logically precedes its redistribution. However, out of this era emerged the development of a social conscience to redress the abuses that had surfaced as a result of the enormous change. The social conscience sought to give dignity to those who were most vulnerable to the rigours of a system not of their making&mdash;that is, the workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trade union movement emerged as the principal force to upgrade and improve the quality of life for the vast majority who found themselves exposed. It saw the redistribution of wealth from the rich to the poor. But for the intervention of the trade union movement, there would have been no redistribution of wealth. Dignity was never achieved for all, but we had proceeded a long way down the path of achieving the goal of dignity for all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second industrial revolution was in the 1960s. There we saw the invention of the microchip, which has changed the face of life. Again, it saw: one, a greater rate of wealth creation than at any other time; two, the nature of work and the way it was done changed forever; and, three, the organisation of society changed. Again, none of this by itself was or is intrinsically bad. However, the social conscience was or became confused; the principal force for equality, the trade union movement, has or is under relentless pressure to roll over and die or be eliminated; and there is now a re&hyphen;distribution of wealth the other way, from the poor to the rich.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The economic rationalist rhetoric of today has blurred people's judgement as to what <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3316"> constitutes dignity or how it can be achieved anymore. The constant factor though remains the need to give people their dignity. Pivotal to this whole concept of dignity is the need to work and to be paid a meaningful wage for that work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The computer era has radically changed the concept of work from what we once knew. No longer can the models of work that applied in the pre&hyphen;1960s or pre&hyphen;1800s have any place or relevance. Hence, it is sad today to still see people trying to apply those models to today's world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst the rhetoric which went with those models may well sound good and warm to some&mdash;hard work never hurt anyone&mdash;it is certainly no solace to those who cannot achieve the first step to dignity: meaningful work. This is simply because the work is not there for everyone to access. There is no greater challenge that we as a society have to deal with than the issue of unemployment. Servile work, pretend jobs or work for the dole schemes do nothing to alleviate the mental and social anguish felt by the unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The unfettered growth of technology, without any concern for the impact on humans and their lifestyle, shows how contemptuous our society has become of the dignity of people. Why, whales, trees, and koalas are treated with greater concern than many humans. It is my view that, unless our society can change its view on what is work, we are headed down the path of social cataclysm.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Essentially, the issues to be addressed are these. What is going to constitute work? On what basis are jobs to be allocated? And how are jobs going to be created? Skills, training, and work organisation must be addressed. Well&hyphen;structured training programs and education curricula are essential to ensure that meaningful work is available to all. Full&hyphen;time employment must re&hyphen;emerge as the linchpin of employment. Maybe caution will have to be thrown to the wind and full&hyphen;time employment be recognised as something substantially less than 38 hours per week with rates of pay equivalent to our current weekly rates being paid. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part&hyphen;time and casual jobs have stripped many workers of their dignity. More part&hyphen;time and casual jobs are not the solution to unemployment. Under&hyphen;employment is as great a curse as unemployment is. Some gurus have tried to popularise job sharing over the last decade as a means of masking the problems of unemployment. Invariably, those who have actively promoted job sharing have been the last to share their own job. Whilst this form of work may have been attractive to a few, for the vast majority it has been a slow way of condemning them to poverty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of late, a more pleasant face has been given to stripping people of their dignity. It is now called downsizing. Downsizing has no logic to it other than lining the pockets of its perpetrators with gains in windfall profits made from share price gains as the all&hyphen;powerful market counts as good news the loss of some person's job. Everyone seems to be downsizing. The only ones not being downsized are those who have the power and control and quite blindly subscribe to this callous and insidious practice because it does not hurt them;  it benefits them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No matter how one dresses things up, the result is always the same: people have lost their jobs, their dignity. I know that, without meaningful work, people are deprived of their dignity and stand condemned to poverty and despair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It disgusts me the way our world outwardly comes forth with pious platitudes about the horrors of unemployment or under&hyphen;employment but, furtively, in the background, proceeds down the path of doing everything possible to satisfy the motive of greed. We, as a society, stand condemned for the way we treat the dignity of our fellow humans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second component of dignity is the right to a meaningful wage. Over the last 200 years, this has been the key element for the worker to get a share of the massive wealth that has been created. Both industrial revolutions have been typified by the enormous creation of wealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been, and are, a limited number of ways to achieve a share of the wealth created in our society. The first is that you can rob. The second is that you can inherit. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3317"> The third is by chance or lottery. The fourth is that you can run your own business. And the fifth is that you work for a wage. It is the last option that covers most of us. It is through the mechanism of meaningful work and a meaningful wage that most of us achieve our share of the wealth being created in our society. The wealth created does not just trickle down. In that time, as wages and conditions were improved, so the wealth was redistributed from the rich to the poor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The disturbing fact now, both nationally and internationally, is that this trend continues to be reversed. This reversal is being driven by the forces of conservatism seeking to reverse the wealth redistribution of the last 200 years. Wages and conditions have been universally attacked in the name of competition, profit, productivity or international trade. Any excuse to reverse the distribution of wealth is used. And the sufferers&mdash;those on the receiving end&mdash;have been, and will continue to be, the ordinary workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Driving wage outcomes down for low income workers is no way of providing them with a path to achieving their dignity. In recent times, we have seen CEO wages in the corporate world blow out to between 25 to 100 times the wage of the base worker. Twenty&hyphen;five years ago, this was a one to three ratio. This widening gap is not sustainable in the long term. It simply breeds envy, contempt and hatred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst some people might take a short&hyphen;term kick in the guts by suffering pay cuts for some trumped&hyphen;up reasons, I have no doubt that they will not stand condemned to long&hyphen;term poverty, as some economic rationalists are trying to achieve. Low income and single income earners need, and are morally entitled to, a fair share of the wealth being created. Their dignity cannot be achieved by a trickle&hyphen;down effect. It will not be achieved by paternalistic handouts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Hand in hand with wages is the need for a fair family support scheme and a preferential treatment tax&hyphen;wise for low income and single income earners. For, if these people are disadvantaged, the poverty trap closes and their dignity is denied. In a related matter, the ability to work and earn a meaningful wage <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> should lend itself to the person being able to be adequately superannuated to enable them to live their retirement with dignity. For not to do so is a fundamental breach of humanity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is morally wrong to say that the strong can have dignity in youth, at work and in retirement whilst the weak have to fend for themselves as best they can. If that is the approach to life, and I believe it is for many people today, then I believe we have not come very far at all. The focus needs to get back to the fundamental of the dignity of people. If our society is to advance, then it needs to address the issues of technology, taxation, superannuation and family support collectively to fulfil the basic need of the human to be able to achieve their dignity. I believe this is the challenge before me in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But in many ways it is no different from the challenges I have faced as a trade union official with the SDA for the last 20 years&mdash;15 as the Queensland branch secretary. It is in that respect that I must acknowledge the counsel and leadership of Jim Maher, the former National President of the SDA. Jim imparted to me over that time much wisdom and an enthusiasm for helping the shop assistants we represented. I am proud to be associated with an organisation that has as its focus the welfare and wellbeing of low income and single income families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was Jim Maher, Joe De Bruyn and my Queensland predecessor, the late Wally Major, who first gave me the opportunity to serve the members of the SDA. I thank them for the chance to serve SDA members. I thank the SDA and my colleagues, including Senator Bishop, for their supporting me in my role now as a senator.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The SDA fought for: one, wage justice for low income earners; two, security in employment; and, three, tax justice&mdash;the biggest tax cuts for the lowest paid. It opposed both major political parties on the introduction of a consumption tax or GST, and constantly fought for improvement to family allowances and the introduction of a homemakers allowance. But the essence was fighting for low income workers and still remains that way.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3318">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to acknowledge the support of my Queensland political colleagues who have supported my move to the Senate, especially Bill Ludwig, Con Sciacca, Jim Elder, Wayne Swan and Mike Kaiser. I pay a special tribute to my late parents who presented me with the principles and values of life and who gave me such a clear understanding of what dignity was about and how to fight for it. Family support was not far away, with the counsel and wisdom of my sister Mary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The importance of family has translated into my later life where I now have the support and encouragement to pursue my interest in my fellow humans from my wife Sue and children Stephen, Elizabeth and Louise. Without their support and understanding, my task would be impossible. So it is with great personal and family pride that I stand here in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I sought preselection in my party, I made it clear that my interests were one, a preferential option for the poor; two, solidarity with the poor; three, seeing that the common wealth was shared; and, four, seeing that things should be done for the common good. Those who are well&hyphen;heeled, in positions of power or otherwise advantaged have little or nothing to worry about. Those people can take care of themselves. The people that I am concerned about are those who are poor, who do not have any power or are otherwise disadvantaged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I shall work through the avenues of my party and through this Senate to focus on the right of the individual to their dignity by being given meaningful work and meaningful pay. I hope I am able to raise the status of people above that of some mere pawn in a production line or something as disposable as a tissue. I will fight for dignity in youth, in work and <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">in retirement.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ipswich was once a thriving industrial centre with mining, woollen processing, railway workshops and meatworks. Those traditional industries are now in decline as Ipswich, like so many working class communities in Queensland and around Australia, feels the impact of structural adjustment on its local economy. Ipswich still has its meatworks but the mines have been reduced, the woollen mill has gone and there is one railway workshop where once there were two.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3319">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For many people, immigrants and locals alike, the land of opportunity has become the land of rising unemployment as people's skills become less valuable on the open market and as the opportunity for retraining and for re&hyphen;employment is suddenly closed to them. They are the people whose interests I am here to serve and with whom I feel an enduring affinity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular, I would like to take this opportunity today to express a special interest in one group among the disadvantaged in our society&mdash;people with disabilities, whose interests and needs I intend to make a focus of my position as a senator. It is true to say that after 13 years of Labor government our community has raised its expectations of services for people with disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those with disabilities, particularly their families, have also had their expectations increased by the Disability Services Act and programs like home and community care. But it is important to distinguish between a physical impairment and a disability. While physical impairment may be incurable, disability most certainly is not. So why must the physically impaired be expected to adjust to a world designed for the rest of us? Why don't we accommodate their disability?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We as a community have to learn to treat each other as equals, to focus on what unites us rather than what divides or distinguishes us from each other. In its 1993 survey of disability, ageing and carers, the Australian Bureau of Statistics found that almost 3,200,000 Australians reported one or more disabilities. That figure represents 18 per cent, almost one&hyphen;fifth, of the Australian population. Of this group, 721,000 reported a profound or severe handicap. In Ipswich alone there are more than 4,000 people on disability support and almost 1,300 who receive the carer's pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ten years ago the Labor government developed the Commonwealth-state disability agreement. The agreement jointly funds employment, accommodation and other disability support services. To the previous government's credit, the agreement has resulted in a real increase in funding and a focus on outcomes. It also led to state and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Commonwealth legislation which formally recognises the human rights of the disabled. The agreement expires in June next year and will need to be renegotiated. I will be taking a close personal interest in those negotiations. For the Howard government, it represents a tremendous opportunity to continue to support people with disabilities, for there remains significant unmet demand for disability services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More than 13,000 severely or profoundly handicapped people are in critical need of accommodation or respite services. Almost 8,000 severely or profoundly handicapped people have a carer over the age of 65. Seven thousand carers are without access to respite, and up to 70,000 severely or profoundly handicapped people may need access to recreational activity to give meaning to their lives. The achievements of our paralympians ought to be enough to demonstrate that. I hope the Sydney Olympics will do a better job of looking after them than Atlanta did, which I am certain they will.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For much of this decade, many rural farming communities, particularly in Queensland, have been crippled by drought. The economic and social isolation brought on by the drought pushed many families to breaking point. When their plight was revealed to the wider Australian community, the response was as swift as it was sincere. The burden borne by the families of the disabled is no less real and no less destructive. It is a burden they have borne on behalf of us all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Physical impairment is only one of the disabilities which many Australians are forced by circumstances to endure. Disadvantage can become a disability unless there is hope. Some people are born with disabilities; other people can become effectively disabled if their disadvantage becomes entrenched. Unemployment, then, is a disability, as is homelessness and poverty and lack of education. It is the responsibility of governments to prevent disadvantage becoming disability. Disadvantage without hope is effectively disability. A just society is one where we not only provide opportunities for people but also give them the support they need to take advantage of those opportunities.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3320">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consider the government's proposal to cut almost $2 billion from labour market programs over the next four years. Getting a decent job has always been the greatest concern for young Australians. Denying young people meaningful employment has proven to be disastrous. Young unemployed people can feel rejected and discarded. They are also more vulnerable to depression, ill health, homelessness, crime, drugs and suicide. But the fact remains that the more efficient and productive our economy becomes, the fewer jobs there are for our young people. The number of jobs for unskilled 15- to 19-year-olds has fallen from 600,000 in 1966 to 240,000 in 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the last decade has taught us anything, it is the futility of blaming the young and unemployed for the situation they find themselves in. A more productive approach combines the creation of opportunity with the provision of support. That is why the Labor Party opposes the government's planned cuts to labour market programs. The cuts send a clear signal to the community that the focus of government policy has shifted. It has shifted from unemployment being the problem to the unemployed being the problem. But the truth is that the great majority of young unemployed people are not dole bludgers. They are the same kinds of people who in my generation left school, got jobs, got married, bought homes and raised children. By breaking that cycle the way we are, we are denying our children and grandchildren the chance to make a future for themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week the Governor-General told the nation that homelessness is perhaps the greatest disadvantage of all. He estimated conservatively that there are currently more than 60,000 homeless Australians. Half of those people are believed to be under 25 years of age. The causes of youth homelessness are known to include family breakdown, poverty and unemployment. Whatever the reasons, there is simply no excuse for anyone in this country to be without a home. For every person who is homeless, there is likely to be another four who are at risk of joining them. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Predictably, no group is under more pressure in the housing section than the young. The youth housing strategy found the mean income of young people to be about two-thirds that of the general population. At the same time, housing costs as a percentage of gross income are 40 per cent higher than other groups. To help overcome these difficulties, many young people live in group households to reduce their housing and general living costs. I share the concern of many people in the community about the impact of the government's decision to reduce rent assistance for people in this situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are living in danger of creating a fractured society. Our communities and our families are in danger of fracture by poverty and unemployment, by hatred and intolerance, by drugs and by crime. I do not believe there is a single answer to all of the pressures which are tearing our communities and families apart. Rather, I think what is required is a building block approach to equality and justice. Particular government programs can give disadvantaged groups and individuals the support they need to take advantage of the opportunities enjoyed by the wider community. By removing those supports, we risk creating a society that is more dependent on welfare rather than less, and less able to cope.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In life, good fortune can never be taken for granted. My progression from the election date of 2 March to taking my position as a senator has not been easy. My son died exactly one week after my election. He was only 28 years old, one month away from his 29th birthday.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That this bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>In placing the bill before the Senate, I want to reiterate two points which cannot be made often enough. Firstly, Australia needs to become more productive. Our living standards, international competitiveness and ability to provide employment depend on it. This bill is intended to help that productivity be delivered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, we have a mandate for the reforms embodied in this bill. Since the election, we have been concerned to ensure that our policy would be implemented in the most effective way possible. Accordingly, we have consulted widely with employers and employer organisations; with unions and the ACTU; with state and territory governments; with women's organisations and the churches; and with ethnic, community and welfare groups. We have been open to the views put by all these groups and have benefited considerably from their suggestions. This is reflected in the bill that is before the Senate. But the fundamentals of the policy itself remain as put to, and accepted by, the Australian people on election day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not, as the opposition is trying to suggest, presenting the Senate with a photocopy of the deregulatory provisions in place in New Zealand or Great Britain. There are critical differences between what we are proposing and what is in place in these countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our reforms will deliver flexibility, as we promised the Australian people, but they will <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> also deliver the fairness and the safeguards promised in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Better pay for better work</EMPHASIS>. Our commitment to the award safety net and the minimum conditions we have identified for agreements make comparisons with the American labour market totally inappropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Several issues have been raised in the public debate and by those here present about the proposed reforms; notably, the future role of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, the simplification of awards, the future of paid rates awards, the assistance being offered to workers with family responsibilities, the government's proposed arrangements for equal pay, the impact of our arrangements on young people, and the ability of employers and employees in the federal jurisdiction to enter into state awards. Let me comment on these important matters before outlining our proposals as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Role of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly the commission's role will change, as it must necessarily do, given the changed environment it operates in. Indeed its role has already shifted under the current arrangements to one of maintaining the award safety net and facilitating bargaining. This shift is reinforced in this bill as the emphasis is placed more comprehensively on the direct parties at the workplace and enterprise level taking responsibility for their own industrial relations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Getting the relationship between arbitration and bargaining right is critical for the overall effectiveness of the system. We know all too well from our past the consequences when the balance is not right: inappropriate wage outcomes develop, taking the focus off workplace reform, fuelling inflation and constraining the scope for sustainable improvements in living standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> For this reason, the AIRC's arbitral role is proposed to be more tightly focused. At the same time its role would be enhanced in a number of other important areas. It would have a new unfair dismissal jurisdiction. It would have enhanced compliance powers. It would be able to make recommendations by consent&mdash;so that it would, when conciliating and if requested by the parties, make such a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3322"> recommendation to resolve differences, provided it is satisfied that the parties will abide by the recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other functions proposed for the commission include:</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the need to establish new principles for the simplification and review of current awards and to govern the handling of the allowable award matters;</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> arbitrating safety net adjustments, taking account of the needs of the low paid;</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> managing competition between unions where this harms a business, by determining representation rights;</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> handling, including the possible arbitration, of disputes where all attempts to reach an agreement have failed and the dispute threatens serious harm to the community or the economy;</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> active involvement in the resolution of disputes in the award area, and where the disputes procedures in agreements empower it to play such a role; and</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> supervising recourse to protected action and dealing appropriately with unlawful action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, we envisage a role for the commission which is consistent with its standing, but a role which is also consistent with the changed requirements of the overall system we are proposing.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Award simplification</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The idea of award simplification is not new. In its Working Nation statement, the previous government stated that `with the expected widespread shift to enterprise agreements over the next few years, the detailed regulation of wages and conditions will largely be determined by agreement at the workplace level, and awards will increasingly only need to protect basic core provisions as a true safety net'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The existing section 150A of the Industrial Relations Act simply does not have the capacity to make that happen. It is now more than two years since that provision came into effect and all we have is a pilot phase in place&mdash;even that is only partly completed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One substantial reason for this is the inherent complexity of awards themselves and the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> range of detailed and confusing provisions that have grown up over the years. In addition there has been resistance to making substantive changes, and in particular to the introduction of flexibilities through the insertion of workable facilitative provisions and enterprise flexibility clauses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill takes a more effective approach to the simplification of awards by:</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> setting out, by statute, what subject matter should be able to be included in awards so that there is a commonly understood starting point;</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> providing for a structured review process, superintended by the AIRC, and working to a clearly established timetable of 18 months following the commencement of the relevant legislative provisions. The 18&hyphen;month period is designed to strike a reasonable balance between not allowing the process to slow again, giving the parties an impetus to agree on the necessary changes and allowing sufficient time to take the necessary action; and</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> recognising that guidance will be needed, and providing for a supervisory role for the AIRC in the process.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Paid rates awards</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the new agreement making environment in which awards provide a safety net of fair minimum wages and conditions the need for different awards types has already disappeared. The differential treatment accorded to certain groups of employees through the existence of paid rates awards is inconsistent with the concept of the award system as a safety net, and can cause instability in the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Over the past decade, reliance on paid rates arrangements have been reduced, with parties to these awards increasingly settling their detailed remuneration and conditions through certified agreements. These reforms will accelerate that process, but they will do so without reducing employees' pay. The government's policy on paid rate awards was clearly spelt out in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Better pay for better work</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3323">
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Workers with family responsibilities</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government made a commitment in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Better pay for better work</EMPHASIS> to help people to combine their work and family responsibilities. The bill implements that commitment across the reform package: in the bill's principal object, and in all the anti-discrimination requirements affecting awards, certified agreements, and unfair dismissal provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A key change to award restrictions which will benefit workers with family responsibilities is the removal of restrictions on `regular part-time employees'. These employees work less than full-time hours but still receive award conditions such as annual, maternity, sick and carer's leave on a pro rata basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I seek leave to incorporate the remainder of my speech in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They also generally work predictable, unlike many casual part-time workers. However, many award provisions for regular part-time work have quotas on the proportion of regular part-time employees, or maximum and minimum levels of hours that can be worked, for example between 16 and 30 hours a day. Employees who wish to work outside these limits may then be forced to accept casual employment in order to have access to part-time hours, or they may be left with no employment at all.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Removing these restrictions will increase the opportunities for workers with family responsibilities to work less than full time hours while retaining pro rata leave and other benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Alternatively, employees can make agreements with their employers which will provide increased flexibility about their working time arrangements. Such agreements could be made under facilitative provisions in simplified awards, or through formalised agreements. If employers and employees choose formalised agreements, those agreements will be underpinned by minimum conditions which include</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Equal pay for work of equal value is a principle the Government is committed to upholding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is strengthening the equal pay provisions in relation to the making of awards and agreements. The Commission is to have regard to that principle in the making and varying of awards. It is to be a minimum condition for all formal agreements&mdash;certified agreements or Australian workplace agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has been questioned about repealing provisions that enable the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to make orders about equal remuneration, including in relation to overaward pay. The Government is strongly committed to equal pay for work of equal value in both overaward, and award pay. The issue is one of process, not principle.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be clear and effective machinery for dealing with the alleged discrimination against women in overaward payments. Individual employees can bring equal pay complaints to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC) or, in the case of an AWA minimum condition, to the Employment Advocate. If the complaint involves direct compliance with a federal award or certified agreement it will be referred to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission for resolution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In combination, the Bill and the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 will give women a clear right to equal pay for work of equal value in relation to awards, agreements and overaward payments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Young people</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill proposes to allow age&hyphen;based junior rates to continue to be used by removing the provisions in the Industrial Relations Act which would require the abolition of junior rates from 22 June 1997. This reflects widespread concern that the shift from junior rates would have significant adverse consequences for the youth labour market. While the bill does not force the replacement of junior rates it allows their replacement over time in particular industries or sectors as the industrial parties identify and develop suitable practical alternatives that will not have an adverse impact on youth employment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill includes a range of provisions directed towards furthering the training prospects for young people. It includes provisions in respect of wages that will facilitate the implementation of new training arrangements through the Government's Modern Australian Apprentice and Trainee System (MAATS). The greater flexibility and expansion in training pathways arising from the MAATS arrangements will substantially increase the employment prospects of young people. The wage arrangements provided for in the Bill preserve existing <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3324"> award rates of pay for current trainee and apprentice arrangements and ensure young people are paid award rates for time spent in productive work for MAATS traineeships and apprenticeships.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Access to state agreements</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the fundamental principles on which the Bill is based is that of freedom of choice. This principle underlines the key reforms the Bill seeks to introduce, from choice about whether to enter into collective or individual agreements, to choice about joining or not joining an industrial organisation to movement between jurisdictions. The Commonwealth is seeking to put in place the same choice in relation to whether employees and their employers wish to enter into State or federal agreements from State or federal awards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill allows for parties on State awards to enter into federal agreements&mdash;either certified agreements or Australian Workplace Agreements. It also enables parties on federal awards to enter into State agreements that regulate wages and conditions by providing that a federal award cannot apply to employees covered by a validly operating State agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed arrangements give the large number of mixed jurisdiction workplaces new opportunities to develop an agreement which can cover their whole workforce. The choice&mdash;with the mutual consent of employer and employee(s)&mdash;to enter into a state agreement is voluntary and will be based on a judgement by those concerned about where they are best off.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principal object of the proposed Workplace Relations Act expresses our intention to establish a framework for cooperative workplace relations which promotes the economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The object focuses on giving primary responsibility for industrial relations and agreement&hyphen;making to employers and employees at the enterprise and workplace levels, with the corresponding role for the award system being to provide a safety net of fair minimum wages and conditions. As a corollary, emphasis is placed on due compliance with awards and agreements, reflecting the responsibilities that properly accompany the provision and negotiation of industrial rights and entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The object also gives priority to ensuring freedom of association, with democratic and accountable <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> employer organisations and trade unions that employers and workers, respectively, are free to join or not join.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would now like to elaborate on some of the key elements of this Bill to explain how the Government's reforms are to be implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our legislation puts the emphasis on direct workplace relationships, and on the mutual interest of employer and employee in the success and prosperity of the enterprise. The Bill promotes a legislative framework without unnecessary complexity or unwanted third party intervention. Above all, the legislation is designed to empower employers and employees to make decisions about relationships at work, including over wages and conditions, based on their appreciation of their own interests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Unfair Dismissal</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, the present unfair dismissal laws are not working&mdash;in fact, they are working against small business confidence, investment and providing more real jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is replacing these failed arrangements with a new unfair dismissal scheme&mdash;a system which provides employees with access to a fair and simple process of appeal against dismissal, based on the principle of a `fair go all round'. It is a scheme that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> is fair to both employee and employer,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> ensures legalism is minimised, while discouraging frivolous and malicious claims; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> is in line with Australia's international obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A new jurisdiction will be put in place for the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, empowering it to consider whether a termination of employment was harsh, unjust or unreasonable, and to create new entitlements accordingly, by way of orders (where appropriate) which will be enforceable in a court. An applicant will be able to be represented by a registered organisation. This jurisdiction will apply only in the traditional federal area of coverage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Terminating employment on certain proscribed grounds will be unlawful, reflecting the current legislation, with the addition of protection against dismissal where an employee fails to sign an Australian Workplace Agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission will be required to attempt to settle an unfair dismissal claim by conciliation, and if conciliation is unsuccessful, by arbitration. Where it determines that a remedy is appropriate, the Commission will have to consider its possible <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3325"> effect on the viability of the employer's business. This will allow the special circumstances of small business to be taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission will be able to grant reinstatement (and ancillary orders in respect of lost pay) or, if reinstatement would be inappropriate, such payment in lieu of reinstatement as the Commission thinks appropriate. The Commission will also be able to order payment of costs in cases of applications instituted vexatiously or without reasonable cause.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The Award System</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, I now turn to consider the impact of our reforms on the award system. At the outset, it is important to be clear that the Government has maintained its commitment to ensure that all employers and employees with federal award coverage will have the choice of remaining on their awards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the role of the Commission, the scope of awards, and arrangements for their adjustment, need to be consistent with and reinforce the role of awards as a genuine safety net. This is important for the viability of the wage system&mdash;to ensure its capacity to provide safety net protection, to encourage agreement&hyphen;making and to meet overall economic objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission's role in relation to wages will focus on the setting of minima&mdash;it will not generally be able to arbitrate claims above the minimum safety net. The mechanism by which the Commission adjusts safety net rates of pay and other award minima will not be prescribed in the legislation. This will be a matter for the Commission to determine.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consistent with the focus of awards on safety net minimum wages and conditions, the Commission's jurisdiction (and thus the capacity of the parties) to incorporate matters in awards will be confined to certain allowable matters. The Bill provides for a Full Bench of the Commission to establish principles relating to the future handling of these matters, as it has done in the past with its existing award jurisdiction. All matters beyond those specified in the legislation should generally be determined at the enterprise or workplace level, whether in formal agreements or informally.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, conciliation will be available with respect to all matters, including agreements and the Commission's making of recommendations by consent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From the date of commencement of the new Act, new awards will not be able to contain matters other than those allowed by the statute. Transitional arrangements will apply whereby parties to existing awards are encouraged and assisted to simplify their awards to focus on the allowable terms and conditions, with other matters addressed by agree <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> ment. After 18 months, any disallowed matters remaining in awards will not be enforceable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission will also be reviewing awards to ensure that provisions are more flexible and geared to the needs of individual enterprises and workplaces. In particular, and as noted earlier, restrictions on regular part&hyphen;time work will be removed from the award system. Such part&hyphen;time work, with pro rata entitlements to the conditions available to full&hyphen;time workers, and reasonable predictability in the manner in which hours are worked, will be a boon for many workers who, for reasons such as family responsibilities, are either unable or do not wish to work full&hyphen;time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With awards concentrating on safety net minimum standards, new paid rates awards will not have a role in the wage system. Existing paid rates awards will be subject to the award simplification process applying to awards generally and, in future, will be treated in the same way as minimum rates awards. Over time and after consultation, paid rates awards would be phased out.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All current legislative provisions relating to paid rates awards will be repealed and the Commission will no longer have the power to make such awards. Current entitlements for the allowable matters under such paid rates awards will be protected, with any changes being subject to the Commission's wage principles. It is expected that parties to these awards will make agreements that determine the detailed remuneration and working arrangements to apply, as most have done to date via certified agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because awards will be simplified, there will be more choice about how work is to be organised at the workplace. With simplified awards, employers and employees will find themselves talking to each other more about how they would like to organise, to their mutual benefit, matters that, until now, have been dictated to them by the award.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I have said, junior rates of pay will be retained to protect the jobs of thousands of young people whose employment prospects would be jeopardised if they were abolished from awards, as Labor intended. However, as appropriate, support is provided for improved training arrangements through trainee wages in awards. Provision for supported wages for employees with disabilities is also made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Agreement&hyphen;making</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, under this Bill, the options for agreement&hyphen;making will be significantly expanded and simplified. Employers and employees in the federal jurisdiction will be able to choose whether they want informal overaward arrangements, or whether they want to formalise their agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For those who want formalised individual agreements, we have provided Australian Workplace <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3326"> Agreements (AWAs). If they prefer formalised collective agreements, they will be able to choose certified agreements (CAs) made with unions or made directly between employers and employees. For those who want agreements under a State jurisdiction, we are providing access to such agreements, bearing in mind that it is a matter of consent for the parties if they choose to go that way.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill does not discriminate in favour of one form of agreement over another&mdash;collective or individual, union or non&hyphen;union. These are matters for decision by employers and employees, according to their own circumstances and their own perception of how their interests are best served.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both AWAs and CAs have been designed to meet the objectives of placing the primary responsibility for industrial relations with employers and employees at the workplace, and reducing the complexities imposed by the current system. However, agreement&hyphen;making under the Government's legislation will be subject to a set of statutory minimum conditions to ensure due protection for workers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both AWAs and CAs will have to meet these minimum conditions. Consistent with our election guarantee, pay must be no less than that prescribed under the relevant award whether you are a regular worker, a casual or a pieceworker. Other guaranteed minima cover conditions relating to annual leave, personal/carer's leave, parental leave, long service leave, equal pay for work of equal value, and jury service.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i) Australian Workplace Agreements (AWAs)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A major innovation in the Bill is the establishment of AWAs, allowing agreements to be reached directly between an employer and his or her employee(s). As I have emphasised, the Government accepts that greater emphasis on flexibility and self-regulation under AWAs must be accompanied by appropriate employee protections and sanctions against those who abuse the flexibility we are providing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AWAs will be formalised simply, by being filed with the Employment Advocate (EA).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The EA will be an independent Statutory Officer whose powers and functions are laid down in the legislation. The Office of the Employment Advocate will facilitate the operation of AWAs and foster proper understanding and application of the opportunities, rights and obligations provided for by the new Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Advice to employees on statutory entitlements and services of the EA will also be required by the legislation, and the EA will provide employers with readily accessible information and pro forma material for this purpose. This will enhance access to the system for thousands of individuals who have understandably avoided it, deterred by the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> time required to interpret complexities that have been generated over the years by the system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Procedures for filing AWAs will be straightforward. A simple declaration will be made by the employer that the statutory requirements for the AWA have been met&mdash;most notably, that the AWA provides terms and conditions which are no less favourable than the statutory minimum conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are specific provisions that protect the right of all employees to choose whom they wish to have representing them as their bargaining agent. For example, an employee from a non&hyphen;English speaking background could choose a bi&hyphen;lingual family member or friend to represent them in negotiating an Australian workplace agreement. This right includes being represented by a union, should employees choose to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Complaints relating to non-observance of AWAs, including breaches of the minimum conditions, may be taken to the EA for investigation, and following investigation and conciliation, can be taken to a court. Thus, if a worker has not received any of the legislated minimum conditions&mdash;or any other entitlements in the agreement&mdash;and if that complaint is substantiated, employers will be liable to a $10,000 penalty for breach of the agreement, as well as whatever recovery of entitlements is due to the employee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The use of duress to obtain an AWA will, where a complaint is upheld, lead to its invalidation, appropriate orders by the court (including rectification by the parties) and/or a penalty. The EA will be empowered to investigate complaints of duress in the making of AWAs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the course of reaching AWAs, there will be a right to take protected action. However, there will be no such right during the specified period of operation of an AWA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are relying on a range of constitutional powers for AWAs, particularly the corporations power. Provision is made for the States, by complementary legislation, to expand the coverage of AWAs to employers and employees outside the scope of those powers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii) Certified Agreements (CAs)</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current certified agreement provisions are being revised. Transitional arrangements apply to cover existing agreements, including enterprise flexibility agreements, provision for which is being repealed. We will again rely on a range of constitutional powers to support the new provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New simplified arrangements will make CAs more accessible and able to be finalised more efficiently. An agreement will be able to apply to all employees to whom an agreement applies within, the enterprise, subject to majority endorsement. The <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3327"> majority approval requirement will obviate the need for the present complex consultation requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CAs may also be made directly with employees. This mechanism will replace the existing Enterprise Flexibility Agreements, of which there have been few, because the provisions invite an intrusive and unwarranted role for unions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If a union wishes to make an agreement, or to participate in negotiations as a principal party, or on behalf of members, it must have a member in the enterprise concerned whose industrial interests it can represent. In the case of agreements made directly between an employer and employees, a union will be able to represent any member in discussions with the employer and, if it so chooses, may become a party to the final agreement if a member so requests (although the union may choose not to be bound by the final agreement). However, the agreement must still be approved by a majority of the employees to be covered, whether or not a union is involved. Special provisions will accommodate greenfields sites, so that agreements can be struck in advance of a business becoming operational.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the enterprise&hyphen;based focus of the agreement system, it is appropriate that the capacity for multi&hyphen;employer agreements to be certified should be tightly circumscribed and involve testing against the public interest by a Full Bench of the Commission. The consent of all employers and the majority of the employees to be covered by the agreement will be required. Protected action will not be available in the making of such agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provisions relating to protected action for bargaining for single business CAs will be retained, in modified form, but any industrial action during the specified period of operation of an agreement will be prohibited.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prior to certification, the Commission will test agreements to ensure the statutory minima are met. In that regard, as is the case with the present no disadvantage test, the minimum pay guarantee may be satisfied on a collective basis. Thus, the guarantee may be met for each employee of a particular kind covered by an agreement if the Commission considers that, when considered overall, the wages payable to all employees of that kind under the agreement satisfy the minimum pay requirement. This will facilitate the ready handling of certification of agreements by the Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In agreements with cashed&hyphen;up penalty rates and annualised salaries, for example, the minimum pay requirement will be satisfied if earnings under the agreement at least match what could reasonably be expected to have otherwise applied under the award at the time of certification.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There would be no ongoing test against the statutory minima, unless provided for by the agreement. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has also responded to concerns raised by various women's groups and community organisations by retaining absence of discrimination as a precondition to certification.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, the Bill contains a requirement for a triennial report on agreement&hyphen;making to be produced, covering the operation of AWAs and CAs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Freedom of Association and Organisational Arrangement</EMPHASIS> s</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I now turn to address the key issue of freedom of association and the role of registered organisations under the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Among the fundamental principles underpinning the Government's industrial relations policy, are the principle of freedom of association&mdash;including the choice whether or not to be in a union or employer organisation&mdash;and the principle that all Australians be treated equally before the law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Government's proposed legislation, employees will be able to make choices about union membership and, if they wish to be in a union, they will be able to join any union whose eligibility rules cover them. They could set up an enterprise union of their own. They could establish a union with special skills and service delivery to suit them, without artificial limits that protect current union monopolies. If they believe the `super union' which covers them is too distant from its grass roots, they can vote to establish an enterprise branch, or vote to support disamalgamation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission will be denied jurisdiction over preference in employment. Existing award provisions providing for preference will cease to have effect. Under the Bill, individuals (including independent contractors) will be protected against coercion to join or not to join an organisation or to cease to be a member of an organisation. Closed shops will be abolished.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is not anti&hyphen;union, and our legislation is not an attack on unions. The legislation will assist unions who are seeking to be effective in providing a good service to their members. Far from withering away, entrepreneurial unions will succeed in this environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To support that development and to overcome the union monopoly situation conferred by the current Act, the `conveniently belong' restrictions on registration and changes to eligibility rules will be repealed. The new provisions will assist in the establishment of new unions, including enterprise unions. The existing requirement that, to be registered, a union must be capable of being a party to an interstate dispute, will not apply. The minimum registration requirement will be lowered (from 100 to 20 members). The maximum annual income for organisations to be subject to less demanding financial accounting requirements will be raised from $10,000 to $20,000. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3328"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mindful of the possibility of adverse effects for innocent third parties from greater competition between unions, the Bill provides powers to the Commission to make orders about the representative rights of organisations. This will allow it to make orders to deal with disputes between registered unions over the representation of workers where there are actual or imminent harmful effects on an employer's operations. In making any orders, the Commission will have to take account of the views of employees involved, and the effect on the operations of the employer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Provision in the Bill to allow for the disamalgamation of federally registered unions recognises that there may be situations where amalgamations turn out to be unsatisfactory. Amalgamations occurred after 1991 in the context of pressured circumstances (for example new provisions of the Industrial Relations Reform Act 1993 designed to force small unions into such relationships). There should be an avenue for members to deal with unsustainable situations where disamalgamation provides a basis for more effectively representing their interests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, and subject to a majority being in favour of disamalgamation, the Federal Court will be able to approve the disamalgamation and make appropriate orders about the fair division of the assets and liabilities, and any other matters necessary to be dealt with to implement the disamalgamation fairly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the legislation, and reflecting the new objects that are proposed, we have moved to strengthen the powers of the Industrial Registrar to ensure that organisations meet the financial accountability and reporting requirements of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consistent with our view that uninvited intervention by unions in workplaces should be addressed, the current provisions in the Act relating to the rights of unions to enter workplaces are restricted under our Bill to unions with members who have requested them to visit their workplace.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, the Trade Union Training Authority Act 1975 is also being amended and repealed through this Bill, allowing for the winding up of the Authority's operations. The Government considers that it should be the responsibility of unions and their members, rather than the taxpayer, to provide the wherewithal for union training.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Compliance</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The existing compliance arrangements in the federal industrial legislation do not strike a fair balance and have been overhauled.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consistent with the generally accepted principles of collective bargaining, industrial action will be permitted in certain circumstances. Provided conditions are met, there will be a right to take <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> such action and a right to lock out in relation to bargaining for a single business CA or an AWA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, there will be effective legal remedies available to those who suffer harm from illegitimate industrial action.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondary boycotts are not an acceptable form of industrial action. Accordingly, meaningful secondary boycott provisions will be restored to the Trade Practices Act 1974 and the relevant provisions of the Industrial Relations Act 1988 will be repealed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current provisions effectively allow unions to hold sectors of the economy to ransom for 3 days at a time. This is inimical to an internationally competitive economy. The Commission will be able to conciliate where a federally registered union is involved in a boycott, but there will be no requirement for a specific period of conciliation before legal action may be initiated by firms which are affected by boycotts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission will continue to have powers to facilitate bargaining for CAs and to suspend or terminate the bargaining period, particularly where genuine bargaining is not occurring or where there is risk of serious harmful effects for the economy or the community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In handling the latter case involving critical situations, the powers of the Commission will be closely circumscribed, emphasising the need for conciliation to be exhausted before any consideration is given to arbitration. Any such arbitration will generally be confined and be undertaken by a Full Bench consistent with principles established by the Commission, and taking account of how productivity might be improved in the business concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Industrial action other than for genuine bargaining for agreements is not compatible with the norms of the system and will not be protected. Existing restrictions and delays inserted by the Industrial Relations Reform Act 1993 on access to remedies for such industrial action will be removed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission will have powers to give directions to stop or prevent unprotected industrial action. This will apply to any matters within its jurisdiction, including inter-organisational disputes (for example, demarcation/representation disputes). The Federal Court of Australia will be able to enforce such directions by injunctions and will be able to award damages and sequester funds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Parties suffering from illegal industrial action will have access to effective legal redress, including injunctions and/or damages. Industrial action that continues in breach of such directions from the Court will be in contempt of court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission will also continue to be able to exercise its existing powers in relation to unprotected industrial action&mdash;that is, stand down provisions; <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3329"> refraining from hearing matters where a party is not complying with an award, order, direction or recommendation; suspension or cancellation of awards; and orders in relation to industrial action in the Commonwealth and Territory public sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Non&hyphen;compliance with an order will provide a new ground for deregistration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will be unlawful: for an employer to pay strike pay; a union (or its representatives) to take industrial action to pursue strike pay; or for an employee to accept strike pay.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, at this point and before concluding, let me emphasise again that the Government is not, through this Bill, diminishing the standing of the Commission. Its role is changed&mdash;but remains important.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also introduces certain complementary institutional changes to give the Commission's operations greater flexibility and effectiveness.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&bull;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The obligation on the President to establish industry panels is being removed and the President, in directing the business of the Commission, is being required to have regard to efficiencies and effective handling of the Commission's work that may be achieved by complementary arrangements with State tribunals; and</PARA>

The detailed arrangements for this have been developed in conjunction with the Commonwealth Attorney&hyphen;General and in consultation with the Chief Justices of both Courts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill protects judicial independence and preserves the position of all judicial and quasi&hyphen;judicial office holders.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Conclusion</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In essence, this Bill meets the commitment which we made to the Australian people on the second of March this year&mdash;a commitment to put the focus of industrial relations policy on the workplace.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill has as a key premise that the simplification of industrial relations processes and formalities is an essential part of our aim to empower individual employers and employees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People will make different choices between all the available options and we welcome that.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is an enabling system&mdash;not a prescriptive system. It gives people in our workplaces the opportunity to design arrangements which:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such arrangements will deliver more jobs, better work and better pay for Australians because they are more productive, with better returns also for investors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is fundamentally what reform of workplace relations in this country must be all about. It's what this Bill is all about.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a very important document. The first paragraph of the introduction states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.1 This report is made in compliance with Division 2 of Part IX of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979</EMPHASIS>  (the Act), which requires the Attorney-General, as Minister administering the Act, to have prepared each year a report giving details of interceptions of telecommunications for law enforcement purposes. This is the sixth report prepared in accordance with the requirements of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3330"> that Division, and relates to the year ending 30 June 1995.</PARA>
<PARA>The Telecommunications (Interception) Act has two purposes: one, to ensure that we, as citizens of this country, can talk to each other over the telephone and use telecommunications in a way that is protected so that our privacy is maintained; and, two, to allow law enforcement authorities to carry out the very necessary purpose of detecting crime and suppressing it. It is important to keep those two things in balance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is for this parliament to set out for law enforcement authorities the limits that they must observe in going about their very difficult and necessary task of investigations. In recent times, the issue of how law enforcement people should go about their work has become a matter of some importance. There was the Ridgeway case last year and, more recently, the Elliott case in Melbourne, a case that was presided over by perhaps the most outstanding criminal law judge in this country, Justice Vincent. What was pointed out in both cases is the fact that we, as a community, must set those limits which preserve the democracy under which we live and, at the same time, enable the law enforcement authorities to go about their task.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> At times, great criticism is poured upon those law enforcement authorities. They have a difficult task and, by and large, they do an outstanding job in preserving the security of this community. It is important that we, as a parliament, are ever conscious of our obligations to see that Australia remains a free and democratic society. We do that by setting the framework within which this society operates, by passing laws such as the Telecommunications (Interception) Act and the various amendments we have made to that act, and by exercising overall supervision and monitoring of how things operate. On the other hand, we should never go too far in making things difficult for those who carry out the duty of policing our society or those who are subject to that conduct. One of the ways that balancing act is carried out is by asking for reports such as this. It is a report which comes out regularly and I think it is the first one that the new Attorney&hyphen;General the Hon. Daryl Wil liams has produced.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise, at this first opportunity, to pay a brief tribute to the contribution that former Senator John Coates has made in this chamber, in the parliament more generally, in the Labor caucus and in the Australian Labor Party. Senators will recall that John Coates announced his resignation on 20 August, on budget day. He did it in a way that typified the man: it was done without fanfare or fuss, it was straightforward and done in consultation with the Labor Party. That is what John Coates was all about. He is a person who has made a very significant contribution to the Labor cause. His contribution covered very many years. He was a member of the House of Representatives as the member for Denison throughout the life of the Whitlam government and was defeated, along with so many other Labor members, in the general election in 1975. He came back into the parliament as a senator in 1980 and his resignation occurred just a few weeks ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John Coates made a very significant contribution and handled his resignation in a way that meant it was difficult for any of us at the time, given that it was budget day, to acknowledge his contribution. I did not ask John Coates whether he thought it appropriate that I now place our appreciation on record. I suspect he might have said, `Oh well, you can take it or leave it,' because, although thinking of resignation for some time, he did not join with other senators during the valedictory speeches that occurred at the end of the last sittings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John Coates's contribution has been one that we ought to record in this place. His <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3331"> committee service in the Senate has been enormous. I do not know of anyone in the Senate chamber, during the time I have served, who had a better understanding of the workings of this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While he was not a person who regularly jumped to his feet and took points of order, when he did, they counted, because there was not a person in this chamber who had a better understanding of the standing orders and the procedures in this place. I suspect his long service on the Procedure Committee and in a range of other guises led to the development of those skills over a long period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was also a person who made a very fine contribution to policy development within the parliamentary party. He was a factional colleague of mine. There are many of us on the left of the Labor Party who also acknowledge his great loyalty to the cause of the left of the Labor Party over a very long period. Again, he took the same approach in relation to that commitment as he did to his loyalty and commitment to the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I found him a person who gave me a tremendous amount of personal support, which I always appreciated. But fundamentally, this was a man whose absolute commitment was to the Labor Party and the labour movement. He demonstrated that through thick and thin. He was a person who had the courage of his convictions within the forums of the party and within the caucus. He was a person who at times was willing to take the leadership of the party on when he felt strongly about an issue. That is always difficult in any political party. It does not necessarily mean that quick advancement is going to come your way when you do that. But he did have the courage of his convictions. He expressed his views without fear or favour, and did so for a very long time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John Coates is a person who is going to be a very great loss to the parliamentary Labor Party. I am sure he will remain an active member of the Labor Party in Tasmania. His retirement will be a loss for Tasmanian Labor as well. He has been a great servant of our party. I think so many of us in the Labor Party are delighted that such a capable replacement for John Coates, in Kerry O'Brien, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> has been preselected by the Tasmanian branch  of the Labor Party. It was so typical of John Coates, as we had a number of functions to farewell him and thank him around this place, that in every single contribution he made, he acknowledged Kerry's preselection and the role that he believed he would play.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So John Coates is going to be a great loss to our party. He has made a fine contribution. I wanted to say, on behalf of my Labor colleagues in the Senate and many colleagues in the federal parliamentary Labor Party, that we will miss him. We believe that his contribution, firstly as a member of the House of Representatives and then since 1980 until very recently as a senator in this chamber, has been a very significant one for our party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While he is a great loss to us, I am sure all of us wish him every success and an interesting future career. I know he is very much focused now on what he is going to do in the future. He has had an interesting career in the past. Before he came into parliament he worked as a scientist, as a biochemist; he has worked as a teacher at university. Of course, he also worked, in those tough years after the defeat of Labor in 1975, as an electorate assistant to Ken Wriedt, who led the Labor Party in this chamber. So he has had a very wide ranging experience outside the parliamentary arena. But we remember his long and very valued contribution in the parliament, in the caucus and in the Labor Party. On behalf of my colleagues, I say to John Coates: thank you. Thank you for the loyalty, thank you for the contribution, thank you for the dedication over the years.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to raise two issues tonight&mdash;firstly, an acknowledgment of the contribution of my Tasmanian colleague Senator Coates to this parliament and, secondly, some matters relating to income tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, I would like to add to the comments made by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Faulkner, on the retirement of Tasmanian Senator John Coates. John Coates <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3332"> served this parliament firstly in representing the Tasmanian electorate of Denison in the House of Representatives and more latterly as a senator. I suppose there are few senators in this place who have put their personal stamp on committee reports and the work of the committees in this House more than John Coates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I met with him on many occasions in relation to issues arising from finance and public administration committee reports. It was not his secretary who was doing the adjustments to the final drafts on the computers, or on the typewriters in the earlier days; it was John Coates himself. So his style was very much reflected in those reports. I must say he was always a dogged fighter for what he believed in. That quality is what we expect of all parliamentarians in this place&mdash;to fight hard for what you believe in and to stand up for what you believe is right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I always acknowledged John's rapport with the Tasmanian community. Even when he became a senator, his personal vote was exceedingly high, which indicated that he must have been very close to the Labor Party and the grassroots of the party that he served. His high personal vote was in spite of the system we have nowadays where there is a preference for ticking a box for particular parties. So I say farewell to John Coates. Thank you, and I wish you and your family the best of health in your retirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second matter that I would like to raise concerns the rewrite of the Income Tax Act. I must say that there are a few pieces of Commonwealth legislation that affect more Australians than tax laws. It should be a matter of considerable concern, but the most significant of these laws&mdash;the Income Tax Assessment Act&mdash;is still in danger of collapsing under the weight of its own complexity, even under the rewrite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The act, as I said, is in desperate need of a comprehensive overhaul. What we have recently seen in the plain English and renumbering system is just mark I. It is currently over 5,000 pages long. It cannot be easily read or understood. It no longer has a recognisable structure. Amendments have been piled on top of amendments over the last 60 years. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem is the cost to business and individual taxpayers of trying to understand and also to comply with this law. It has been estimated this cost ranges from $3 billion to $6 billion annually, a very significant amount. So any reduction in compliance costs, therefore, will be a significant micro-economic reform matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The defects of the 1936 act have been known for some time. Indeed, in 1993 the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, on which I served, in report No. 326&mdash;a landmark report on the administration of tax law and the operations of the tax office&mdash;recommended the law be simplified. The previous government accepted that recommendation only in part and the tax law improvement project was born. The purpose of the project was known by all as the tax law improvement project&mdash;TLIP&mdash;and it was to restructure, renumber and rewrite in plain language the income tax law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point that I wish to raise is that what has been done in no way mirrors what report No. 326 of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts really recommended or asked for. In that 1993 report, we said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . any attempt to redraft the Act must necessarily look at broader, structural issues within the total taxation system. Simplification, in this context, should concentrate on achieving a tax system which is fair, equitable and economical. The objective must be to reduce the total cost of the taxation system. Consequently a redraft of the Act, while crucial, cannot be successfully achieved in the absence of a fundamental review of the administrative, political and social implications of changes to the Act.</PARA>
<PARA>From there you can see we have only done mark I in terms of the plain English rewrite. So, consequently, in performing a redraft, the committee in 1993 believed the fundamental assumptions underlying the act, including the basis on which the act must be administered and the policy directions inherent in the act, should be evaluated, discussed and clarified. That has not been done. The report went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, the possible alignment of the taxation law with accounting standards and concepts would be a fundamental change to be considered. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3333"> </PARA>
<PARA>I express some concerns. It is for those reasons that I got myself back on the Joint Committee of Public Accounts to try to bring the system back on track. In a sense, we have partially done that. While it was stated that one of the main objectives was to reduce the long-term costs of compliance, it is unlikely, in the committee's view&mdash;and this is in the latest report&mdash;that the cost will come down significantly until such time as the underlying complexities of tax policies are addressed. So for the first time since 1993, parliament was told of the significant need to address these sorts of issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there still continues to be a sense of frustration that unworkable sections of the Income Tax Assessment Act are being perpetuated in the 1996 bill. Unfortunately, addressing those concerns was beyond the mandate of the current tax law improvement program. That was, indeed, unfortunate so my comments are in no way a criticism of that team which was very admirably led by Brian Nolan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In practice, the tax law improvements mandate could not have been expanded without the rewrite process becoming bogged down in policy debates, but we as a committee, when we reviewed this tax law rewrite, indicated there is a minimum. There is a continuing need to address the small policy complexities being highlighted by the tax law improvement process. The success of the committee's review process suggests that a parliamentary committee may be an appropriate forum to examine those sorts of issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee also believes that the tax simplification does require more than just a rewrite or a tidying up of even policy complexities. What is ultimately required is this wide ranging review of tax policy at the federal and state level. I do acknowledge the comments made by the new senator from Western Australia, my colleague Senator Eggleston. I was particularly moved by the comments that he made in relation to the fringe benefits tax and the adverse effect it is having on the development of the Pilbara and north&hyphen;west of Western Australia because this is an area where a fringe benefits tax was designed for city based operations rather than <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the bush. I suppose the fringe benefits tax has done more than any other piece of legislation to move people out of the regional and remote areas and back into the city. This is a tragedy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to take this opportunity to thank all those people who have participated&mdash;the tax law improvement team. It was not their fault that the mandate was so limited, but I think it is incumbent on the new government to pick up this issue. The recommendations are there for a more fundamental review. Unless we do this, our taxation system will continue to bog down business with unnecessary compliance details.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the years of the previous government, we have seen such things as fringe benefits on car parking&mdash;an extension of the whole concept of fringe benefits well beyond what was intended in terms of salary related sacrificial issues. It behoves the new government to look very closely at these issues if the Australian government is going to continue to grow and to prosper. I thank the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

Following on from the theme that we enunciated in question time today, I hope he is keeping a very careful eye on the new superannuation tax and the complexities that that will have on superannuation funds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wanted to make some remarks tonight about my former Tasmanian Senate colleague John Coates from a number of perspectives. I found on John Coates' retirement that after just six years I have become the senior Labor senator for Tasmania. I am not sure whether that is a good or bad thing, but it did lead me to reflect a little on John's career. I first met John at the 1968 conference of the Tasmanian Labor Party held at the university. John was standing for preselection for the Federal seat of Denison. The ballot that took place was a relatively open ballot for the Australian Labor <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3334"> Party. It was a time when actually making a speech at a preselection process did influence a significant proportion of the delegates who were present on that occasion. My recollection of John&mdash;it was my first conference&mdash;was that John gave a very impressive speech on that occasion, which, given the narrowness of the result, certainly contributed towards his being preselected as our federal candidate. He was elected to the federal seat of Denison in 1972. Regrettably, he lost his seat in 1975.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During his period in the House of Representatives it has not often been acknowledged&mdash;I would like to acknowledge it tonight&mdash;that John Coates played a significant role in the development of Labor's health policy during that period of government, particularly in the development of Medicare's predecessor, the Medibank system, which was regrettably scrapped over a number of years following the election of the Fraser Liberal government in 1975. I would like to place on record John's contribution in that area because it was very substantial. He would have to have been considered one of the major architects of our health policy through that era.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also recall quite vividly the events in the lead-up to the 1972 election when the then leader, Gough Whitlam, visited the Hobart Town Hall. A meeting took place at which my father, who was then a federal member, and John were speaking. On that occasion John gave two commitments. I related the story to him a couple of weeks ago when we had some retirement drinks for John. One of the issues he raised on that occasion was the transfer of the Antarctic base from its then location in Canberra to southern Tasmania. That was a specific issue and a specific commitment that John made. He made it a cause, and he delivered on that cause. He spent a number of years lobbying the federal Labor government during that period up to 1975, and he was successful. I think the then science minister was Mr Bill Morrison. He came to Hobart and announced the transfer of the Antarctic base. That has been critical, important and central in the development of Tasmania as an Antarctic centre for management and research. If there is an enduring <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> legacy to John, it is the Antarctic centre in southern Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other commitment he gave was a commitment in respect to bull semen. John could not recall that issue that he raised on that occasion. He had a particular interest in that issue in those years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Up to 1975 John was a very active contributor in parliament and a very thorough, assiduous and dedicated member of the House of Representatives. Despite his defeat, John remained active in the Australian Labor Party. He was subsequently pre-selected and elected to the Senate. Throughout his period as a senator, John had a very distinguished committee career. I will just mention a couple of committees on which he was actively involved. They included the privileges committee, the regulations and ordinances committee and a range of other general policy committees. It is work that is not often recognised outside this place. Certainly from Labor's perspective, John was one of our major contributors in putting issues into policy through the Senate committee system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said earlier, John was a very committed, dedicated and assiduous worker and very thorough in his approach, and a great stickler for detail. At times I found him a little too detailed from my dealings with him in the party. They are all attributes that led to his making a fine contribution in those areas. I have said earlier that committee work, as we all know, is very important in this Senate. Unfortunately, not enough people read the committee reports that we publish. Any cursory glance back through those reports would show that John, both as chair of a variety of committees and as a member of those committees, was a very active contributor indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Faulkner has referred to John's factional activity. I was not a factional colleague of John's. We did have some differences of opinion over the years during his political career, but in politics I think it is important that we do not carry those differences personally. I certainly never did with John and I know he did not. He had a very committed set of principles. He always followed those principles through within the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3335"> Australian Labor Party and within the broader community. He was a very dedicated and active senator, in particular in that area of committee work that I have highlighted. I think he is an example to anyone who wants to be involved in the committee area. There is also his work on the finance and public administration committee. I understand he was chair of that committee for a number of years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Former Senator John Coates can leave the Senate, reflecting back on an almost 20&hyphen;year political career during which he made a significant contribution in terms of policy, committees and the internal workings of the Senate. As I said earlier, I think the Antarctic centre in Hobart is a monument to the perseverance of John as a politician. I wish John all the best in whatever his future undertakings. I wish his family all the best. I know that one of the reasons he decided on retirement at this point is that his son is entering his teenage years and John wants to spend more time with him. We all know the pressures on families, friendships and relationships as a consequence of our political service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John was a hard&hyphen;working dedicated senator and I would like to pay tribute to him not only on behalf of my Tasmanian colleagues but also on behalf of the Labor opposition.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator Alston</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Transport and Regional Development has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The Federal Office of Road Safety (FORS) commissioned a study in 1995 with the Monash University Accident Research Centre (MUARC) to investigate crashes involving airbag&hyphen;equipped cars. The study was aimed at not only examining the benefits of airbags but also to alert FORS of any inherent problems with airbag deployments in the real world. Currently, MUARC has investigated sixty (60) cases of airbag deployment and there has not been any case of either adults or children in the passenger seat being injured or killed because of the airbag deploying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, FORS is carrying out a joint project with the New Car Assessment Program consortium to provide consumer information on the benefits of airbags. This will involve crash testing a range of passenger cars fitted with and without airbags to provide an authoritative assessment of the injury reduction benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) In Australia, children are required by law to be properly restrained in an approved child restraint. Approved child restraints incorporate an <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3338"> upper tether strap which anchors the restraint to the vehicle structure. This requirement precludes the use of child seats and the like in the front seat of vehicles. The United States is now keen to follow Australia's lead in this area to minimise the likelihood of further fatalities in the US. The Federal Office of Road Safety has close links with their counterparts in the US, Canada, Europe and Japan so that there are regular reporting channels to alert FORS to any potential vehicle safety problems. In addition, FORS vehicle safety experts attend international meetings and conferences where the latest vehicle safety issues are canvassed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The full frontal Australian Design Rule (ADR) specifies injury limits measured by sophisticated crash test dummies. This allows manufacturers to choose the type of safety technology to demonstrate compliance and also encourages research into new, innovative restraint systems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The setting of performance criteria is aimed at minimising the likelihood of serious injury in severe crashes. To meet the full frontal crash requirements, manufacturers do not necessarily have to fit an airbag&mdash;an energy absorbing steering assembly, heavily padded steering wheel and improved seat belts can provide similar safety benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, an airbag can reduce minor injuries on the occupant's upper torso and head in medium severity crashes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The seatbelt wearing rate in the Unites States is only now approaching 70%. Australia has been over 95% for many years. Mandating airbags in the USA was the only way their government could ensure that occupants who do not wear seatbelts have some form of protection in crashes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This has its downside, as researchers are now finding out. To protect the unbelted, US airbags must fire early and with greater force (so&hyphen;called `aggressive') than the systems seen in Australia. This means that the small in stature, the elderly and unrestrained or poorly restrained children in the USA are disadvantaged and both low and high speed crash cases are now emerging where the US `aggressive' airbags have caused fatal or serious injuries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is why the Australian Design Rule requires the seatbelts to be fastened, allowing the vehicle manufacturers to tune their systems for restrained <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> occupants which results in less `aggressive' airbag systems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) Vehicle manufacturers fit a warning label to the sun visor of cars fitted with airbags. A typical example of the wording used is given below:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">`WARNING<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> ALWAYS WEAR YOUR SEAT BELT</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The wearing of seat belts is required by law, even when an airbag is fitted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">An airbag inflates very quickly and with great force. If you are too close to an inflating airbag, it could seriously injure you. Seat belts help keep you correctly positioned for airbag inflation in a crash.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">NEVER install rearward facing infant/child restraints (eg baby capsules) in the front seat, as serious injury may result from the force of the inflating front passenger airbag.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">If a forward facing child restraint is suitable for your child and is used in this front passenger seat position, always move the seat to its rearmost position, and buckle and tighten the seat belt.'</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Under the bench mark adopted in the Tax Expenditures Statement produced by the Treasury, negative gearing is not considered to be a tax expenditure.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, in the 1993&hyphen;94 income year, the actual amount of interest claimed against rental property income (that can be described as negatively geared) was $1,510 million for taxable individuals, and $557 million for partnerships and trusts.
