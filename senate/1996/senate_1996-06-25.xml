<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. Minister, concerns about possible delays in funding CDEPs caused by the freeze on all ATSIC outlays pending clearance by the special auditor were first raised with you here in question time on 27 May. Given that is now a month ago and given that you were provided with two opportunities yesterday, including 10 minutes in the adjournment debate, to explain how your `special arrangements' would deal with this problem and you failed to do so, can you now please, please explain to the Senate when these special arrangements were put into place and how they are going to work?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VW4">Senator HERRON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Collins should be ashamed of himself. He has been spreading this misinformation, as he said, for some weeks now. It has been explained, Senator Collins. You have been guilty of spreading misinformation and fear through Aboriginal communities. You have been guilty of creating alarm in CDEP recipients. You have also been guilty, collectively, of allowing these appalling conditions to occur for Aboriginal people for the last 13 years and guilty of trying to sabotage attempts that we are making to rectify the situation. Keep doing that and you will earn the displeasure of all the Aboriginal communities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We would not have had to appoint a special auditor if you had not let the situation deteriorate to this point. If those on the other side are genuine in wanting to help Aboriginal people, they should desist from whipping up a frenzy about grants being frozen, which you know to be untrue. Once again, I will have to set the record straight.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Grants continued to flow as normal until the appointment of a special auditor on 4 June, Senator Collins. On 6 June I wrote to the ATSIC chairman in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have agreed to transitional arrangements associated with the work of the special auditor whereby grant recipients which have no present breaches of grant conditions and only minor technical breaches, if any, in the past may receive a grant pro rata for the first three months of the 1996&hyphen;1997 financial year.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the only organisations in danger of funding being frozen are those with serious existing problems of accountability. I also have the power to approve grants in exceptional circumstances.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Panizza for the question, because it is about time we reminded the opposition what was said in their time. I will finish the quote from Senator Graham Richardson that was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>  over two years ago, to follow on from what you said, Senator Panizza. I quote him again:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I don't think it's worthwhile me getting into an argument with ATSIC or anyone else about who's responsible for Aboriginal health. What we've got is a mess, and if we're going to try and clear up that mess, I don't care who's doing it as long as someone is.</PARA>
<PARA>Then in parliament, in March, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . on 10 May . . . the problems of Aboriginal health, which have been ignored for a couple of hundred years, will not be ignored. There is a major plan afoot; it will be announced in the budget.</PARA>
<PARA>As we know now, there was no major plan afoot; it was just more grandstanding from the Labor government. The reality of the situation is that we are still left with a devastating picture of neglect in the area of Aboriginal health, a situation Labor did not improve in any significant way over the more than a decade that they were in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The evaluation of the national Aboriginal health strategy released in December over two years ago found that life expectancy for an indigenous female was about 62 years of age, whereas the Australian average is 81; for indigenous males it is 57, whereas the Australian average is 75. Labor's record on Aboriginal health is a disgrace.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have been left with the enormous task of cleaning up the mess that they left. For all their rhetoric about reconciliation and social justice, they have failed to deliver any real improvements in this regard to Aboriginal people. This government will not use the tactic of inflating expectations and not following through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Aboriginal health will be the highest priority but the steps we take will be practical and will advance in a real way the national Aboriginal health strategy agenda of 1990, intersectoral collaboration, community control and involvement, and a comprehensive view of health.

But the most interesting thing of all, which I would not want the Senate to miss out on, is that the former government have had a longstanding commitment&mdash;you could call it a secret agenda&mdash;to changing the benchmark. They not only commissioned the Department of Social Security to put out a paper&mdash;it took 18 months&mdash;called `Developing a Framework for Benchmarks for Adequacy of Social Security Payments' and which came out in November last year, but it also commissioned the University of New South Wales for further studies.</PARA></TALK.START>

I refer the minister to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian social trends 1996</EMPHASIS>  report which details the plight of Aborigines in Australia. Is it a fact that, after 13 years of Labor, the report notes that the average annual income of indigenous men and women is only $15,400 and $12,700 respectively, that the overall health status of the indigenous population is still far worse than the wider community and that Aboriginals continue to suffer preventable diseases found only in developing countries? How was this situation allowed to occur?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VW4">Senator HERRON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Good question, Senator Troeth. I did see a report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  newspaper today and I am pleased to see the editor in the gallery so that this answer gets reported. The report highlighted just how bad current standards of living are for Aboriginal people. The previous Labor government should publicly acknowledge what it has done to Aboriginal people in this country and accept responsibility for their grim lifestyles today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do they really have a conscience on the other side? For 13 years they did nothing to stop the slide into poverty and ill health. For 13 years they sat back and told everyone that they had solved the problems. We heard all about the solutions of the problem. For 13 years they lied to Aboriginal people and now we are left to face the music. The reality of Labor's legacy is still coming to light and reports such as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian social trends 1996</EMPHASIS> bring home the cold, hard truth of the situation. The report tells us that the annual average income of indigenous women is just $12,700 and $15,400 for men. The overall income of non&hyphen;indigenous Australians was $20,000 but indigenous Australians received just $14,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The main source of income for 55 per cent of the indigenous population is welfare, although many Aboriginal people work for the dole under CDEP, as I have mentioned previously. Thirty&hyphen;eight per cent of Aboriginal people cannot find work and, of the remainder of the community, 27,000 are employed under <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2097"> the CDEP work for the dole program. Without this program, the unemployment figure would be closer to 57 per cent. Half of all indigenous people over 13 told the Australian Bureau of Statistics in 1994 that they smoked cigarettes and 30 per cent said drug use was the biggest health problem in their area. Nearly 60 per cent reported alcohol as the biggest risk factor and 20 per cent said poor diet was the most detrimental part of their lifestyle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Aboriginal people are still more likely to live in rented houses than non&hyphen;Aboriginal Australians and usually in crowded conditions. Overall, the picture is a bleak one. Social trends do not appear overnight. These conditions are a direct result of 13 years of neglect by the previous government. We are now facing the enormous task of repairing the damage that the Labor government inflicted on these people. The rest of Australia should be aware that for a very long time now Aboriginal people, especially in remote communities, have been missing out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I travel around the communities, I hear constant complaints about the fact that, although this appears to be being done, nothing is occurring or very little is occurring on the ground. Sure there was money allocated, but the previous government just did not bother to monitor whether, in fact, any of it was actually reaching the people. It wasn't and the figures I have just given are a sad reflection of that fact. The opposition cannot ignore the facts. They are the facts as reported in today's newspaper. Sadly, it will take years to repair the damage that has been done and those on the other side should be ashamed.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In answering those questions let me say that there does not seem to be an attempt to ask them in a consistent dollar value. I take the point you make, Senator Chamarette, but what it is really about is to acknowledge that, regrettably, there must be cuts in the Ombudsman's office, as there are across the range of government expenditure. You know the reason for that as well as I do. Basically, we have inherited an $8,000 million budget deficit, something that the former government was not prepared to tell us about during the election campaign.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe it is in the best interests of the economy and, therefore, of all Australians if we address that over the forthcoming two years. So the Ombudsman's office is going to have to suffer some cuts. In fact, the cuts to the Ombudsman's office are less than in some other parts of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. I think the figure that has been talked about was about 15 per cent. We think it is important that the Ombudsman be properly funded. The Ombudsman has an important responsibility to the community. There will always be a debate as to what is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2100"> the adequate funding support to meet that responsibility. All that has been said in this answer is that, if it is a 15 per cent cut, it will equate to about that which was provided to the Ombudsman in the year 1994&hyphen;95.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, Senator Chamarette, I take your point. The Ombudsman will have less funding and will have to make priorities, as we are having to do in all areas of government expenditure.

How are you going to tackle that problem as the responsible minister?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="2102" SPEAKER="Hill, Sen Robert" NAMEID="BH4" ELECTORATE="SA" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Environment" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable senator for the question. It is certainly a timely warning. I know Senator MacGibbon is interested in the wellbeing of rural Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that this study by the Industry Commission staff information paper did refer to almost one&hyphen;half of agricultural land in Victoria, one-third of agricultural land in New South Wales and 15 per cent of agricultural land in Queensland as degraded and requiring treatment. It could have just as easily referred to the literally hundreds of thousands of hectares of land in your state of Western Australia, Mr President, that are equally now degraded and badly requiring rehabilitation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a major problem facing this country and no doubt the most serious environmental problem that faces Australia. I commend the work of the report's author, research economist Paul Gretton, who added that he regretted in many ways to say that, if he had a better research base, he would have identified even greater areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Senator Faulkner interjecting</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Faulkner interjected, part of the solution to this problem lies in the new Commonwealth government's natural heritage trust, which will enable $1 billion to be reinvested in the environment. But, in particular, $32 million for the national land and water resource audit <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2103"> would provide research economists such as Paul Gretton with a better information base to assist us in proper planning to overcome these problems in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr President, you would be interested to know&mdash;although the opposition is not&mdash;that this degradation is now estimated to be costing Australia $1&half; billion annually in lost production or the equivalent of about six per cent of Australia's annual agricultural production. So it is, as I said, a vitally serious issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Remedial efforts through land production schemes, land care and the like can be of assistance. There is no doubt about that. But major reinvestment is also needed in the environmental capital because, unfortunately, so much of this damage has come about through ignorance which has led to over clearing and that has led to rising watertables, high salinisation and the destruction of rivers and creeks. This land degradation can be recovered only by a major reinvestment in natural capital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to this government that it is highly legitimate to reinvest that capital from another asset. In this instance, as you know, we propose to sell one&hyphen;third of the capital in a telecommunications company and out of that have access to a capital sum of $1 billion to reinvest in this natural capital. Firstly, this would enable us to spend over $300 million on a natural vegetation initiative and for the first time since white settlement in this country, for the first time in the last 200 years, to produce more revegetation than land clearance. That will have a major beneficial effect upon the degradation problem we face.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, it will enable us to put another $160 million into the Murray-Darling project to help recover that vitally important source of water for over a third of Australia's rural production. Finally, it will enable us to put $85 million into a wider national river care program, which will enable us to start to tackle the degradation of the remainder of Australia's major rivers and basins.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a worthwhile investment. It is an investment that I commend to the Senate.</PARA></ANSWER>

Does the minister stand by those conclusions? If so, why is he now attacking the ABC? If the minister does not stand by his own words of last year, why has his attitude changed?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is very important to understand that there is a very big difference between commercialism and operating in a business&hyphen;like manner. I saw this mistake made by Lindsay Connors, a former deputy chair of the ABC, in a letter to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  the other day. It is very important to understand that the ABC is a major national cultural institution which I think all sides of the parliament very much support. What it ought to be is a quality alternative to the commercial sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because you are strongly supportive of the ABC does not mean that you simply allow it to operate in whatever fashion it chooses. Indeed, if you look at what Lindsay Connors had to say, all you needed on the board were people who were intelligent, hard working and, presumably, well motivated. My point is that you want people&mdash;indeed, you are required by the ABC act to have people&mdash;with the necessary financial and management skills and broadcasting expertise. If you have those sorts of people on board, you are much less likely to go down the dry gulches that the ABC went down in relation to pay TV where, as you would be aware, $6 million was basically thrown away. You know of some of the other exercises that were  not successful, such as BNA, where they tried to set up a competitive alternative to the AAP news wire service. You would also be aware of the ABC's efforts in relation to the marketing of D&hyphen;Cart and, of course, you would know about the ongoing saga of ATV.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2105">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of those exercises tell me, not that the ABC itself is not a very valuable institution, but that the ABC needs to operate in a business&hyphen;like fashion. It does not mean that you treat the whole of the ABC as a business with a commercial motivation to simply maximise revenue, but it does mean, for example, that if you are getting over $100 million, as they currently are, from ABC enterprises, you do look at whether they are getting the best rate of return on the funds outlaid. If the profit figure is about $6 million, it is a legitimate question to ask whether they might be able to do better by contracting that service out or by looking at other ways of ensuring that their cost structure is adequate for the purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">None of that for a moment detracts from the proposition that the ABC is worthy of strong support from all sectors of the community, that it has a valuable role to play. Indeed, it has charter obligations, nebulous as I have said I think they are in some respects. But the fact remains that that is no excuse to simply turn your back on a requirement for any government funded organisation to operate in the most effective and efficient manner possible. We are talking about a $600 million corporation. This is not some mickey mouse outfit where it does not really matter as long as you have got people with good intent. I would have thought you would be interested in value for money. Taxpayers expect us to exercise responsibilities on their behalf, and we do that by ensuring that the ABC has the best possible people there to discharge its responsibilities.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Parer), to a question without notice asked by Senator Foreman today, relating to uranium mining in Kakadu National Park.</PARA>
<PARA>The question to Senator Parer was a perfectly straight question. When I came into the chamber before question time I said, by way of interjection to Senator Parer&mdash;Senator Faulkner can attest to this; he was here&mdash;and I meant it, `We are asking a question of you today, Warwick, and it is a benign one.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Parer is well known for his support for the uranium industry, and he has given a big run to my support for it over the last 15 years&mdash;that support has always been predicated on the question that we are raising here today. Despite his support, the traditional owners who were present at that meeting told me personally that they were over the moon about it; they were absolutely delighted; they had had a great meeting with the two ministers and they were very pleased with what had been said to them. They said that Senator Parer had actually told them categorically that there would be no new mine at Jabiluka unless the traditional owners supported it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You will be pleased to know&mdash;people who have known me over the last 20 years in politics will know this&mdash;that I actually then <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2108"> said a few very kind words about Senator Parer. I said, `I have always found him to be a forthright person, and I am delighted you're pleased that he told you that.' Separately&mdash;I am happy to put this on the record because I was told this by the journalist concerned&mdash;after the meeting was over, he confirmed to the journalist from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> that that is what he had told the traditional owners and she reported it in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then, hardly surprisingly, I was approached by the traditional owners who do not want the mine&mdash;and I am aware of the incident that Senator Parer talked about. It is not just Yvonne, Senator Parer. She happens to be very important because she is the old man's eldest daughter and, as everyone has told you, Senator Parer, she is the senior traditional owner. Her view is important. She is not the only one, Senator Parer, and it might interest you to know that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My support for the industry is up&hyphen;front. I had a meeting with representatives of the traditional owners here in Parliament House only last week. They gave me the names of the people who do not want the mine, and it is a long list. They asked me&mdash;it was important to them and I did not think it was unreasonable&mdash;if I could get Senator Parer to simply repeat in the parliament the assurance he gave them without any frills attached to it. And&mdash;fool me&mdash;I said to them, `I am sure Senator Parer won't have any trouble doing that.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why I said to him in a friendly interjection across the chamber, `We've got a straight question for you today, Warwick, no hooks attached.' I honestly expected he would simply put on the record in here, with no equivocation, the same absolutely categorical assurance, which I understand was made in the presence of Senator Hill, that he gave not just to the traditional owners on the record but also to the journalist from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> separately on the record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Parer, can I now give you a further opportunity to say something&mdash;clearly, it is like drawing teeth and I am sorry about that&mdash;to simply repeat the assurance you gave that meeting of traditional owners, and that is that if the traditional owners of the mine, that is, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a majority of them, do not want Jabiluka, as far as this government is concerned, it will not go ahead.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I said, I understand that there is a requirement for the Northern Land Council&mdash;as the representative body of the traditional owners&mdash;to consent. I further understand that, whilst the new proposal at Jabiluka might be less environmentally intrusive than the old proposal, it is arguable that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2109"> it is a different proposal and that a new consent might be necessary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not my job to tell the Northern Territory government whether adequate consent in terms of the mining approvals has been given. However, speaking in generalities&mdash;and Senator Collins knew the answer before the question was asked&mdash;consent of the NLC is necessary. There is an argument that consent for the old proposal at Jabiluka had been given and that a new consent might have to be given for the new mining proposal at Jabiluka. If that is so, that is the legal question, and no doubt the NLC would consult with traditional owners before giving that consent or otherwise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We certainly had discussions, as my colleague said, during our visit. We had discussions with the NLC in Darwin, and we had discussions with some of the traditional owners at Kakadu. As Senator Parer said, the impression we got was that the NLC could see advantages in the new mining proposals&mdash;in terms of the economic benefit that could flow to its constituents&mdash;but it seemed that there was division between the traditional owners as to whether a new proposal should go ahead. As I understand it, discussions between the NLC and the traditional owners are still taking place in that regard, and no doubt the position will be further clarified in due course.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Collins would do well to take up Senator Herron's offer. Last night in the adjournment debate, Senator Herron offered you the chance to discuss with him these particular matters, to sort it out and get the right answer. Did you do that? No. What did you do? You came back into this chamber and kept on misleading the chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a broadcast day, and you know that the information that was broadcast today was wrong.

In 1984, I believe, Max Cameron, the president of the PLA and a couple of other people and I, as president of WAFF, took to the then Premier of Western Australia, Brian Burke, a Labor Party Premier proposals on a program to buy stations in Western Australia. That program has delivered 43 stations to the Aboriginal people in Western Australia. I am sure Senator Cook will remember the debate that went on with regard to that.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman), to a question without notice asked by Senator Schacht today, relating to the recommendations of the National Commission of Audit on pensions.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Newman, during question time, waved around the adequacy project document. This project was of course a project of the previous Labor government, which was trying to get information on the level of income required to sustain a particular quality of life.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2111">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that it was to measure the cost of a basket of goods associated with low income, middle income and high income households, so it would then be possible to make an assessment of the adequacy of DSS payments against the known costs of, for example, low income households. That stands in very stark contrast with the situation that was referred to in question time today and also yesterday in the Senate relating to the tasking of the National Commission of Audit in relation to the average weekly earnings benchmark.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former government was simply working out whether or not to use an alternative benchmark related to wages. The clear difference between this and what Senator Newman said in a desperate attempt to crawl out from under this matter is that that is a wage input measure rather than, as the Labor government was looking at, a quality of life outcome measure. I think it is very deceitful for Senator Newman to try to draw some comparison between both of these matters, and it is appropriate that the record be set straight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point is that the government, a coalition government, is tasking the Commission of Audit. This is made absolutely clear in the letter contained in appendix A on page 304 of the Commission of Audit's report. The reason it has frightened pensioners in this country&mdash;and they are quite right to be frightened&mdash;is that this was specifically targeted at the contrast between the use of total average weekly earnings and the use of male total average weekly earnings. It was the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey), through Mr Potts, the Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, tasking the National Commission of Audit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The National Commission of Audit got the message very clearly indeed from the Prime Minister and other ministers, and it gave its political masters exactly what they were looking for. It gave them a recommendation that consideration be given to using the total average weekly earnings in place of male total average weekly earnings&mdash;that is in the key recommendations in chapter 7 on page 156 of the report&mdash;which equates to a 15.8 per cent reduction in the pension.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has also become clear is that these key ministers in the coalition government&mdash;the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance&mdash;did not even have the courtesy to take Senator Newman into their confidence on this matter. When this matter was raised in this chamber, she could not escape from the very clear conclusion that this had been done without consultation with her, the relevant minister.

<PARA>The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron), in an attempt to dig himself out of a deep hole entirely of his own making, today attempted to sidetrack this particular debate with yet another run&hyphen;down on the health of Aboriginal communities, and a lot of personal reflections. With respect, the question of health in Aboriginal communities is a major issue but, in the context of this particular debate on CDEPs, it is a complete red herring. The debate is not about improving in Aboriginal communities the health conditions, which were absolutely horrific when we came into government 13 years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a specific debate about what is going to happen in communities while those communities await clearance by the special auditor of approved grant monies for their CDEPs. The money runs out this Friday. The debate goes to a complete lack of consultation by the federal minister with anybody on this issue. He confirmed it last Friday. He never discussed it once with the board of ATSIC and, in his own words, he told the chair less than half an hour before the announcement by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) that it was <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2112"> going to be done. That is why the mess has been created by the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, Mick Dodson, told a committee of this parliament last Friday that every single indigenous issue to date has been mishandled by this minister. Mr Dodson described the government as arrogant and ignorant. He said that he was troubled that he, a normally moderate voice, which he is, was responding in such an aggressive manner. But he explained his aggressive manner by saying, `I am terrified of what they are going to do next.' That is a great endorsement from a person who is normally a moderate voice on behalf of Aboriginal Australia!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Senate question time yesterday Senator Herron said&mdash;and it is in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>&mdash;that none of the problems being experienced had occurred as a result of the appointment of the special auditor. I was astonished when he said that. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They are the result of actions and a lot of misinterpretation of material which occurred as a result of the previous budget.</PARA>
<PARA>I pointed out that, as well as it being gobbledygook, it of course is utter factual nonsense. He directly contradicted himself yesterday when he told the Senate last night that he had checked with ATSIC after question time and was told:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The special auditor, KPMG, and ATSIC have a well&hyphen;defined process for handling such situations and are in a position to respond quickly where delays to release the funds may cause hardship in a community. If the Bunuba Aboriginal Corporation or any other funded organisation has been told that no funds will be released until 15 July, then that advice is clearly incorrect . . . special arrangements are in place to deal with such cases of hardship.</PARA>
<PARA>Despite about 10 invitations from me last night during a 10-minute adjournment speech, he of course could not tell us last night what those special arrangements were; he had to be briefed this morning. This is after a month of being given forewarning that this matter was going to cause a problem.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am almost sorry for Senator Bob Collins. It takes a lot to make me sorry for anybody on the opposition side, but I realise now what is happening.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason I am sort of feeling a bit sorry for Senator Collins is that he is coming to terms with opposition. I well know, having been in opposition for six years, that you are always about a month behind the pace. You are always getting material that has gone through the exercise of being handed on, it goes to a minister, it comes back, it goes back to the person who sent it and then they send the letter on.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Faulkner will just have to come to terms with this. As I have seen now over the last couple of months, when you are in opposition you bluff, you bluster and you blow yourself up into an extreme so that your argument seems to have validity. One cannot help but feel that your argument has validity because of the manner of the delivery of the material.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the reality is that Senator Collins has beaten this up into an issue which is untrue. He may have done it inadvertently, and I accept his assurance. I detailed what is happening in relation to the special auditor and the manner in which these materials are put through. There is a priority rating given.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Collins has been trying to disrupt this whole process; but that is what opposition does. I understand that you attack a new minister. Senator Collins in this field is far more knowledgeable than I have been. He has devoted a lifetime to it. I accept that, as did former Senator Richardson when he graciously acknowledged me in relation to health care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it is not Senator Collins's role to come forward with material which is demonstrably untrue, having received material that refutes the arguments that he is putting up. It is the old story. I was a great admirer of Senator Button when he was here. He had a style of answering questions which I think did the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Senate proud in the manner in which he handled questions. But I do not recall him at any stage adopting a bluff and bluster and bullying approach. There is not a place for that in this chamber. I ask Senator Collins to reconsider his position in that regard. It does not become him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have already stated the facts of the matter. The facts are on the table. The answer has been given. Now Senator Collins is going to pursue the issue. I suggest he desist because he is about a month behind the pace. I have been happy to adopt a bipartisan approach in this regard with the joint committee and with the opposition. This sort of bluff and bluster and disruption is reasonable in terms of the opposition's performance because what else have they got to fly with? They have nothing to fly with in relation to the Aboriginal community in view of the last 13 years of dereliction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an opposition tactic. If they want any information, I am happy to give it to them because that is their right. I would supply it to them. I will be tabling material that will reinforce what I have already said in due time.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday, Senator Bob Collins gave notice of a motion for a return to order of these reports. Senator Collins, during his term as Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, often referred to the need for transparency in the government's consideration of drought exceptional circumstances. Unfortunately, the senator's actions did not reflect his rhetoric as minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1994, Senator Collins refused to supply the opposition with a range of documents relating to drought exceptional circumstance declarations, including reports of the Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Council. Mr John Anderson, the then shadow minister, along with the Victorian Farmers Federation, had to resort to using the Freedom of Information Act to obtain the material in question. Some six months elapsed before the Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Council reports were made available. That is not what I would call transparency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Collins continued to be less than cooperative in dealing with requests for later reports of the Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Council, although at least interested parties did not have to resort again to using the Freedom of Information Act. I would like to draw the attention of the Senate to the contrast between the attempts of then Minister Collins to evade his accountability to the parliament and this government's genuinely transparent approach to drought issues.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At a leaders' meeting held some weeks ago it was agreed that, should it be required, the non&hyphen;government senators would facilitate a Friday sitting at the end of the winter sittings as part of a range of measures to ensure proper consideration of the government's program. I have given notice of a motion regarding a Friday sitting as a precautionary step in case additional time is needed to complete the bills which are currently on the program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To date, the Senate has passed some 27 bills. It has failed to allow consideration of seven. Whereas the government welcomes the cooperation it has received for the most part with a certain proportion of the 27 bills, it has to be said that the seven bills which have not been considered include those which clearly form a very important part of the government's legislative program. Not included among the seven bills is the workplace reform bill which is expected to be received in the Senate and then immediately referred to a committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There remains on the program to date some seven bills, including the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2). It is true to say that two of those seven bills are essentially non&hyphen;controversial in nature, although I am always wary of making that claim. We hope that they can be dealt with in an expeditious manner. Additionally, some other bills may be returned for consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is always difficult to predict how long debates will take for a bill and when bills will be returned from the other place. In order to deal with particular challenges in the final week of sittings, we will need flexibility in the arrangement of business of the Senate during the remainder of this week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, I hope that senators will agree to consider bills returned from the other place late on Thursday afternoon or evening should that be required during the course of the valedictory speeches. Naturally, I hope that we can deal with business in a way that may <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> avoid a Friday sitting, but I would have to say that this is by no means certain, and the government feels that it has a responsibility to ensure that the legislative program is dealt with before we rise for the winter recess.</PARA></SPEECH>

<ROLE>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate)</ROLE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I thank the Manager of Government Business (Senator Kemp) for his explanation of this motion that he has given notice of today in relation to the Friday sitting. I might say, for the information of senators in the chamber, that this was a suggestion that I made at the aforementioned leaders' meeting. Not only did I suggest that the Senate sit on Friday of this week, but I suggested that it sat also on the Friday of a previous sitting week as a preferred option to significantly changing the sitting hours and times of the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as the opposition is concerned, of course, we are happy to facilitate the business of the Senate. It is an approach, I might say, that stands in very stark contrast with what occurred in the life of the last parliament when the current coalition government was in opposition. It elevated Senate obstructionism to an art form.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The scorecard that Senator Kemp mentioned in his contribution was correct, in as far as it goes: before the end of the sittings, 27 bills will have been passed by the Senate and seven others will have been subject to the constraints of the Senate's order of continuing effect, which is, again, an order of the Senate that can, quite rightly, be described as all your own work. The so&hyphen;called `cut&hyphen;off motion' was a proposal that came from the coalition in opposition. </PARA>

It was opposed by the Labor Party in government in this chamber. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2118"> It is something that you will recall, and which you were very embarrassed about, and have been for a very long time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The attitude of the opposition is a very constructive one. It is always flexible, always reasonable, always sensible. We do not want to see bills deferred to the first day of sitting of the budget session. We want to have a thoroughgoing parliamentary capacity for parliamentary scrutiny of these pieces of legislation. I think that the Senate's committee system will also allow thorough public participation in that process, as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to place on record the opposition's view in relation to the procedures that are proposed by Senator Kemp. The same constructive and sensible approach that has been taken by the opposition throughout these first sittings of the new parliament will continue until its conclusion on Thursday or, as Senator Kemp suggests, on Friday, if that is when we finalise the parliamentary and legislative program of the government.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<STATE> (New South Wales)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(4.23 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the documents.</PARA>
<PARA>This may be one of the last occasions on which I have the opportunity to move that the Senate take note of an Auditor-General's report. I simply would like to say at the beginning that I found that one of the greatest contributions to proper supervision of government spending and activity has been provided by the Auditor-General over the many years I have been a member of this place. I hope that senators will continue to place on record their recognition of that work by commenting on his reports when they are brought down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This particular report is of great concern to me because, when I was in the House of Representatives, I represented a fisheries area on the south coast of New South Wales which was subjected to severe quota and equipment restrictions. Many times I have been concerned about whether or not some fishermen were feeling the excessive burden of regulation. At other times I have been concerned that fish stocks were being overwhelmingly and unnecessarily almost wiped out because of overfishing. Whether that related to people from other countries fishing in Australian waters or to locals fishing is a matter for some debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does concern me is that this Auditor&hyphen;General's report reveals many serious problems in the management of Australian fisheries, largely because control over them is split between the Commonwealth and the various states. The key question is: how can Commonwealth fisheries law effectively control these problems and to what extent is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2128"> sustainable development capable of being assessed? I would like to deal with a few matters in this Auditor&hyphen;General's report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that one of the major problems is that, when a professional fisherman puts down a net, he cannot determine what is going to end up in that net. You get many fishermen who find that they have overfished a particular species in terms of their own quota by accident&mdash;and this may be an expensive species. They are then obliged to dump these fish over the side unrecorded. This, firstly, costs them a lot of money and, secondly, creates a situation where there is no recorded evidence of the extent to which a particular species has been fished and then returned dead to the sea. The Auditor-General's report mentions in passing this problem. It says on page 130:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many of the other fisheries are single-species fisheries but, depending on the gear used, a whole range of other fish can be caught and, if it is not marketable it is often dumped overboard (discarded) and no records are kept.</PARA>
<PARA>The same thing is true of fish where there is a very severe quota limitation. So we have a ridiculous situation where, because of a lack of flexibility, dead fish are being dumped. This is of no use to the protection of the fishery and is certainly of no use to the fishermen. If only one could have a much more flexible plus and minus arrangement, it would be far more sensible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problems that the Auditor-General has pointed out are basic. He points out that the Australian Fisheries Management Authority cannot be certain that it is achieving ecologically sustainable development. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Stock assessments have been carried out for only a very small percentage of the fish caught in Commonwealth waters, whether a target or other species. There is little knowledge about Commonwealth fishery habitats, nurseries and the environmental impact of commercial fishing for most of the Commonwealth fisheries. No environmental impact assessment has been conducted for any Commonwealth fishery decision. Also, due to the high level of latent effort, fish stocks cannot be regarded as being adequately protected from the possibility of excessive commercial fishing. Latent effort refers to unused or under-utilised fishing permits. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor&hyphen;General then deals with the subject of maximising economic efficiency in the exploitation of fisheries resources. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Based upon AFMA's statistics for fishing permits, statutory rights and boats, the use of inherently inefficient input controls and the ineffectiveness of the quota system in the South East Fishery, there is little evidence to indicate that there has been a significant improvement in economic efficiency in Commonwealth fisheries since AFMA was established.</PARA>
<PARA>This seems to be central. There seems to be a real need to do something about this on the basis not only of providing better information but of doing a lot more research.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am concerned about the precautionary principle that has been adopted&mdash;that is, where there is an element of doubt, usually associated with a lack of fish stock information, management decisions should, according to this principle, favour the protection of fish stocks. In other words, if the authorities do not know what the situation is, it is the fishermen who cop it, if you like, rather than the fish.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are going to threaten the livelihood of Australian fishermen, there is a particular obligation on the authorities doing so to know perfectly well what the real situation is rather than to do it on the off chance that there may be a problem and, therefore, destroy the viability and the livelihood of Australian fishermen. So there is a clear need for much better and greater levels of information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This precautionary principle is subject to a few legal problems. The AFMA advised the Auditor-General that its legislation did not give it the power to implement this policy and provided recently received legal advice. This advice indicated that the imposition of fishing controls to protect stocks could be ruled invalid unless there was sufficient evidence to support the need for a reduction in catch levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The audit office considers that, if this legal advice has general application to all fisheries, AFMA will have difficulty in achieving its ESD objective established by parliament. It was parliament that established that precautionary principle. Consequently, the audit <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2129"> office has recommended that AFMA seek to clarify this apparent conflict between its statutory objective and its statutory powers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are other matters that are of concern to me. For example, the Auditor&hyphen;General reveals that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Environmental Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act requires AFMA to provide advice to the Minister if a fisheries management decision will have or is thought likely to have a significant environmental impact. A decision to provide advice can originate only from some form of environmental impact assessment.</PARA>
<PARA>That sounds great, but the facts are that during the audit the Audit Office observed there had been no environmental impact assessments of any fisheries management decisions under either AFMA or the former AFS, and no referrals to the Environmental Protection Agency, so either the system has not been working properly or the system is wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Something has to be done to fix this up. The big question is whether or not to limit, and this is a matter the Auditor&hyphen;General went into. If you are going to regulate fisheries, do you limit the amount of equipment and boats that are allowed to fish, or do you limit the catch? In other words, do you have input controls imposing restrictions on the type and/or amount of fishing, such as gear restrictions, closed seasons and so on, or do you have output controls which just limit fish catches or landings?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I mentioned, if you limit fish catches, then it means a fisherman who has accidentally overcaught a particular species will simply dump it in the ocean and everyone will be the loser. According to the 1989 policy statement, the use of output controls&mdash;that is, limiting fish catches&mdash;was adopted. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite this stated preference, the ANAO noted that most Commonwealth fisheries are managed through input controls (only one of which has tradeable units of gear). No fishery has been placed under output controls since AFMA was established.</PARA>
<PARA>We have to resolve which is the best way to go about this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I want to mention that AFMA, according to the Audit Office&mdash;</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">advised that the majority of Commonwealth fisheries will continue to be managed using input controls. This form of control is acknowledged generally by fisheries managers to be ineffective in protecting fish stock if controls do not match improvements in technology and leads to inefficiencies.</PARA>
<PARA>The ANAO noted that&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">recent stock assessments indicate that over capacity, latent effort and over&hyphen;capitalisation still exist.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a serious and significant report. Fishing is a very important industry to Australia and&mdash;certainly for the south&hyphen;east fishery area where I have many friends and associates involved&mdash;I must express concern that, unless we regulate it properly, this industry will face a serious future.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(4.33 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, rise to speak to the Auditor&hyphen;General's Commonwealth Fisheries Management reports. As Senate Baume has mentioned, serious concerns are expressed in the reports in relation to one of the objectives of the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, that is, ecologically sustainable development. Today we have heard that there is not sufficient information regarding fish stocks in Australia. They are not just saying that we do not have full information; they are also saying we do not have accurate information on most species, most of which are commercially important species, with regard to most Commonwealth fisheries. Where fish are caught is known. This information can be obtained from figures supplied by the licensed fishing industry. However, although they generally know where fish breed, they do not necessarily know where juvenile fish live, nor do they know the movements of these fish.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is important for a number of reasons. Obviously, with any major marine development it is very hard, if not impossible, to ascertain what the impact will be if the information is not there. I always feel a bit cynical when somebody makes a statement saying that there will be very little environmental or ecological impact on a particular coastal development when we know they do not know about the fish stocks or fish life cycles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Very recently, the Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator Parer, mentioned that he <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2130"> had solved the problem regarding Japan's concerns about southern bluefin tuna. Why is this a problem? It is a problem because we know&mdash;and clearly these reports show this&mdash;that we do not have enough information about fish stocks to base any decisions upon. We may well have made Japan happy and in that sense perhaps solved a problem, but if we base our decisions on the monitoring of catches we will head into a situation where there are serious problems which it will be too late to deal with. It will be too late to solve the problem when the fish catch is seriously depleted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what do we do instead? We should concentrate on strategic research regarding stock before issuing permits to fish in Australian waters. Perhaps, if countries such as Japan wish to increase the take of certain fish species in Australian waters, they could be required to contribute to the cost of such research. The Australian Fisheries Management Authority may facilitate such research, but countries wishing to increase or even maintain their current levels of catch should participate in funding that research.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to understand in terms of species around Australia that we have not pooled a lot of the information currently available. Often the bodies given the task of finding out about fishing do not have full details. Possibly, in terms of many species&mdash;fish, birds and terrestrial species&mdash;we should bring together all the people researching various species to share that information so we can establish a base line for the last part of the century and have a much better idea of implications for the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A cynical thought occurred to me regarding Senator Parer's response in relation to Australia's ineffective greenhouse responses when he said we could remove the word `sustainable' from the energy council and then say, `See, we have met our goals because we are no longer required to be sustainable'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that will not happen in this regard. One way to help the Australian Fisheries Management Authority might be to remove the words `ecologically sustainable development' and then say, `See? All we have to do is keep the industry happy.' The only <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> problem is that it is very obvious that any decisions you make which will affect the ecological balance of our fisheries will have a very quick commercial impact on the industry itself. Often, when particular fishing companies have access to a closed system, they make sure they do not overfish, they make sure that the breeding areas are maintained and not polluted. If there is a problem, they are directly financially affected. In the case of greenhouse, the same sort of thing happens, but it is a long way down the track and the industry is not immediately affected by those decisions. So if the industry makes decisions in relation to ecological sustainability, it impacts on other people at other times, not immediately.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I argue that the principles that are beginning to be accepted in relation to sustainable fisheries should also be acceptable in other areas. We should realise that if we are talking about ecological sustainability, we are talking about the ability to survive. If we understand there is a need for our fishing industry to survive and not to overfish, not to destroy the resource, we should also transfer that understanding to other industries and take a precautionary approach so that we do not all end up paying and paying into the future.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to refer to some parts of the report&mdash;in particular, section 47 of volume 1 of the report, which appears at page 16, relating to stock assessment. I noted with interest that Senator Baume said that where the fisheries management, AFMA, find they do not have sufficient information, they fall <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2131"> down on the side of the fish. He was criticising that approach. I think that is a very sound policy to have. It should be encouraged even further, because it is important that we do not overfish our fisheries stocks. We have done so on many occasions and we have stuffed up monumentally.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any of us who are fishermen do not have to look far to understand exactly what we have done to our fisheries stock, particularly in respect of the poor old recreational fishermen. It is of fundamental importance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing I noted with concern is something that we looked at during the Senate inquiry, that is, having a management strategy. The ANAO, in section 48 of its report, says that only one fishery has developed a five&hyphen;year strategic plan and full implementation of the process is not comprehensive or consistent. I think that is absolutely true. It is a failure on the part of all of us that we do not have proper strategic plans for what is not only a very important food source for this country but also an industry with export earning potential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report talks about fisheries controls. We know the control measures do not work. We know that the by&hyphen;catch is a major problem&mdash;the fact that there cannot be a proper transfer of quotas, et cetera, and that we do see so much waste. Yes, there have been improvements but those improvements are sadly lacking and there is still a long way to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Section 58 talks about the achievement of ecologically sustainable development. We are so far from that that it is not funny. We do need to make a concerted effort. In terms of research and funding, I do not mind admitting that when we were in government we probably did not provide sufficient funding. But I can assure you I will be raising the matter with this government. Remembering things that have been said by some senators on the other side, that there is insufficient funding for research&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I used to park my car at the wharves in Hobart and saw at first hand the fishing boats coming in. This was in the early days of the discovery of the stocks of orange roughy.

The fact that they did not have any knowledge of how many fish were there soon became evident when the stock ran out.

<PARA>It is with a considerable sense of achievement that I table this report, which describes one of the most important actions of the committee in 1995. The committee's actions in this case were noteworthy because it formally resolved to recommend that the Senate disallow a set of regulations unless the minister gave an undertaking that day to amend the regulations to meet its concerns. The committee's concerns related to lack of external review of the merits of decisions made by a public official to refund or remit charges. The committee had referred the question of review of these discretions to the Administrative Review Council, a statutory body whose functions include advising government on whether administrative decisions should be subject to review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ARC agreed with the committee that the present decision should be reviewable by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The committee decided that, in these circumstances, it should insist that an undertaking be given to amend the regulations. Fortunately the minister gave such an undertaking, so there was no need to recommend disallowance. The report describes scrutiny by the committee of the eleven sets of regulations which comprise the principal regulations, illustrating the types of matter which concern the committee and the method of its operation. The report illustrates that the committee is not a mere rubber stamp under which a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> minister's explanations are acceptable as a matter of course, regardless of whether they are convincing. The committee will, where appropriate, recommend that an instrument be disallowed. It goes without saying that the committee's actions were non&hyphen;partisan and the decision to recommend disallowance was unanimous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report also illustrates the tenacity of the committee. The regulations in question at first included no provision at all for refund of charges, then provided a discretion for a refund to be made, then removed the discretion but retained the refund, then removed the refund, then provided again for a discretion to refund, then provided for the discretion to be delegated, then amended the discretion and then amended it again. The committee scrutinised this entire public administration kaleidoscope, raising with the minister not only the question of external merits review but also breaches of personal rights, breadth of delegated powers and drafting oversights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee, as usual, kept the Senate informed of its activities by incorporating its correspondence in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> whenever it withdrew a notice of disallowance in respect of one of the sets of the regulations and by the then chairman, Senator Mal Colston, several times advising the Senate that the committee may be taking unusual action. Finally, the report illustrates the thoroughness of the committee, which wrote or received 22 letters in the course of its scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On behalf of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, I am pleased to table this report as an instance of how it carries out its mandate from the Senate to ensure that delegated legislation is of the highest possible quality.</PARA>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Statement on delegated legislation affecting civil aviation</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recent report by the New South Wales Coroner on the tragic Monarch Airlines crash at Young which resulted in seven deaths, including three schoolchildren, brought into focus a number of issues affecting civil aviation safety. The sad crash of the Defence Force Blackhawks near Townsville, although not a civil aviation matter, also highlighted air safety generally. As Chairman of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances I would like to report briefly to the Senate on scrutiny by the Committee of delegated legislation regulating civil aviation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During 1995 there were 810 disallowable instruments made directly under Acts affecting civil aviation or under delegated legislation authorised by those Acts. Of these the great majority, or 725, were Civil Aviation Orders, made in the form of Airworthiness Directives, which set technical standards for the service and maintenance of different types of aircraft, engines and equipment. There were a further 58 instruments which exempted individual aircraft or, in a smaller number of cases, specified aviation activity, from these basic requirements of the Civil Aviation Orders. The balance of the 810 instruments were Regulations, Determinations, Declarations, Directions, Permissions, By-laws and Instructions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The basic scheme of the legislation is clear. Every Australian aircraft must either comply with the Civil Aviation Orders or be exempted from such compliance. Most exemptions relate to requirements to carry or operate specified aircraft equipment. It is understood that the aircraft involved in the crash at Young was not equipped to the standard required by the Orders and did not hold an appropriate exemption in relation to such equipment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coroner found, in relation to the Young crash, that the Commonwealth Act and Regulations laid down what he described as "strict rules" regarding aircraft safety. The Coroner, of course, used this description in an approving sense. I will mention later in this statement how the Committee has contributed to this standard of regulation of air safety. The Coroner found, however, that the legislation was not properly administered. An unannounced inspection of the Monarch aircraft prior to the crash revealed what the Coroner described as serious deficiencies and breaches of the Regulations, which do not appear to have been adequately addressed. The Coroner further found that there had been a lenient approach to policing legislative requirements, with the senior echelons of the relevant agency loathe to prosecute for breaches of the Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Young tragedy illustrates firstly the necessity for laws to be enforced. It is, of course, unsatisfac <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> tory for an elaborate system of legislation to provide for a matter as important as air safety if those provisions are not administered in a proper fashion. Secondly, the incident shows that the transparency provided by the existing requirement to table all exemptions must be maintained. The safety of the travelling public is such that these exemptions, which dilute the usual safety standards, should be granted by a process which, if necessary, includes the most rigorous scrutiny and oversight. Tabling in Parliament, with the possibility of disallowance, provides such oversight.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, on behalf of the Senate, scrutinises this mass of Civil Aviation Orders and Exemptions to ensure that they conform to its high standards of parliamentary propriety and personal rights. In December 1994 the Committee's Legal Adviser and the Secretary met in Parliament House with officials of the then Civil Aviation Authority to discuss a major review of legislative instruments affecting civil aviation. This review was prompted largely by the Committee's concerns at some aspects of this legislation, a number of instruments being invalid for incorporation of documents contrary to the Act, for prejudicial retrospectivity, for lack of enabling powers and for lack of procedural requirements. Deficiencies in a recent Exemption from the Orders resulted in an aircraft holding a purported exemption in fact operating illegally. Honourable Senators may ponder the consequences had this aircraft met with misadventure. Some By&hyphen;laws made by the Federal Airports Corporation were also void. There were other concerns apart from invalidity, such as strict liability offences, breaches of privacy, failure to effect legislative intent, failure to provide for review of administrative decisions, wide powers of delegation and drafting defects, one instrument, for instance, providing for a compliance date of 31 June. At the suggestion of the then Chairman of the Committee, Senator Mal Colston, the Minister agreed to provide the Committee with a six&hyphen;monthly Report of the review of the legislation. After receiving the first Report the Committee's staff met again with officials of the Authority to discuss what the Minister described as the Committee's requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At its first meeting this year the Committee received and considered the second six&hyphen;monthly Report, to 31 December 1995, prepared by officials of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. Honourable Senators should note that the Report advised that the review team needed to correct the defects in the civil aviation delegated legislation, picked up largely by the Committee's actions, included four technical specialists who prepare drafting instructions, three in&hyphen;house legislative drafters and two part&hyphen;time drafting consultants. The Report further advised that all drafting instructions had been completed, with some drafts available for cross&hyphen; <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2134">checking and review. Although it was unlikely that new legislation would come into operation before the end of 1996, this was within the original timeframe.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Scrutiny and action by the Regulations and Ordinances Committee has ensured an outcome which should result in delegated legislation affecting civil aviation being of a high technical standard. It is this delegated legislation which is used to administer the day to day operations of civil aviation in Australia and which has the greatest practical effect on the companies and individuals involved in the industry. Of course, as the coroner's report has illustrated, the best legislation is useless if it is badly administered and it was this aspect that the Coroner criticised. It is the responsibility of the executive and its agencies to administer legislation properly. In the meantime, however, on behalf of the Standing Committee, I can report to the Senate on the generally satisfactory result of scrutiny by the Committee of delegated legislation affecting civil aviation.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<TIME.STAMP>(4.53 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not intend to speak for very long on this bill, but there are a couple of things I wish to put on the record from the perspective of most of Western Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Acting Deputy President, you may know that the Wool International Act 1993 was enacted after the collapse of the reserve price scheme. The reserve price scheme had a debt of about $3 billion and about 4&half; million bales stockpiled. The government of the day introduced a bill in consultation with wool growers and wool growing representative bodies around Australia by which there was a fixed schedule release of 750,000 bales from the stockpile&mdash;that broken up into four quarters is about 180,000 bales a quarter. There was to be a wool tax, which was set at a certain rate at the time, and that was to reduce the money owing on the stockpile. Hopefully, it would get rid of the stockpile completely and anything over would go back to the wool growers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I simply want to put on record that I believe that that act and the fixed release of that stockpile has been a success. We started, as I said before, with a debt of about $3 billion and 4&half; million bales or thereabouts in the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2135"> stockpile. It is now down to 2.2 billion bales and, with the fixed release over the next 12 months, that will be reduced by another 750,000 bales, which will bring it down to about 1&half; million bales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that the wool industry around Australia is hurting. I know that they believe that releasing those 750,000 bales a year&mdash;or 180,000 a quarter&mdash;is depressing the market. I know it is depressing the market because the buyers and the mills, knowing there is a stockpile there, are not prepared to commit very far forward. However, if we do not take the big pain in the short term, we are going to have a pain for a mighty long time. Under this fixed schedule, as I have said, in 12 months time there should be 1&half; million bales left; in two years time it should be down to 150,000; and in three years time it should be down to zero. On my quick calculation, that will be on 30 June 1999. Then we will have the wool that has just been grown coming onto the market, and the market should strengthen and pick up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us go back to the height of the stockpile and the height of the debt. At the breaking down of the reserve price scheme, Australia was producing over 1,000 million kilos a year. That is about five million bales if a bale is roughly 200 kilos. With the reserve price scheme&mdash;or the fixed price scheme or the guaranteed price scheme, or whatever you liked to call it at the time&mdash;we were producing that amount. A lot of grain and beef growers swung to growing wool, and that virtually doubled the production over three or four years. That could not last and, as you would know, Mr Acting Deputy President Watson, the reserve price scheme virtually went into liquidation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Traditional wool growers have now reduced production to 500 million kilos a year, which is about 2.25 million bales. So there is still four million bales coming onto the market, and that is something we will have to put up with until we get that stockpile down. When the stockpile is eliminated, we will go back to a true, free enterprise system in which each grower will decide that, if they can grow wool at that price, they will do so.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I feel for the pastoralists of Australia who can only run sheep and not cattle. But if we do not have the pain in the short term, there will be pain in the long term. I advise them to keep going a bit longer. We will eventually eliminate that stockpile. I believe that the government of the time, aided by others, came up with a pretty good scheme, and let us not get nervous at this stage. There are moves afoot to try and cut that fixed schedule release, but I think it would certainly be the wrong thing to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think Wool International could look at a different or better method of timing to dispose of that 180,000 bales a quarter. At the present moment, they feed it on to forward sales. Hopefully, they finish that quarter before the next quarter starts. For the quarter 1 January to 31 March, hopefully they will have made the contracts and got rid of the wool and they can start selling again a lot earlier than the beginning of the next quarter. Hopefully, on 31 March&mdash;I have used that example&mdash;they will have sold the wool and they will only interfere with the physical market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, the depressed demand for wool over the last 12 months or so has caused a lot of wool to be still stored at the beginning of the quarter. Discounts have had to be made at that stage to unload the wool that may be left out of the 180,000 bales. The pastoralists and graziers of Western Australia have come up with the idea not to sell any more under&hyphen;contract or private sales at the end of the quarter or at the beginning of the new quarter. They believe it should go onto the floor in the new quarter without reserve. It is a system that I believe could work. Rather than becoming nervous and interfering with the act as it is now, we ought to look at that proposal. Perhaps we could find a better disposal of each quarter, but we should certainly not reduce 750,000 bales per year to half that figure. We should not start fiddling with the market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This situation is similar to the problems that we faced when increasing the reserve scheme. In that situation the buyers said that they did not know what was happening and that it was just as likely that the price would be dropped further because it was believed the whole <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2136"> stockpile system might collapse. I ask farmers to have confidence in the 1993 act. I know that the former government brought it in but they did not think of it all by themselves. They got a lot of input from others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to address the point of Wool International Holdings. In this bill there is provision for $24 million to be set aside from the fixed assets to set up a forward marketing scheme. It is only enabling legislation that is going to allow the setting up of a futures market. I understand that a business plan has to be accepted by this Senate before that will come into action. I believe there is a sunset clause of self&hyphen;destruction in that enabling legislation if the business plan is not accepted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All I have to say about that $24 million, whether it comes out of fixed assets or not, is that it belongs to wool growers. Wool International should not have any ideas about it being a lot easier to get money out of fixed assets because that money belongs to the growers. I have doubts whether that will make any difference to the market. When the stockpile's debt was at its highest, nearly $3 billion was supplied. In other words, three thousand million dollars at that stage did not fix the wool problems of Australia. So what will $24 million do? I consider that it is a last gasp method by people who have been around the wool industry for far too long; hanging off the edges to keep themselves going a bit longer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that in Sydney there is a futures market in which you can do a deal with a wool stockbroker to forward sell. You can arrange a contract up to 12 months in advance while the wool is still on the sheep's back&mdash;or has not even started growing on the sheep's back. In that way, you can sell your wool at an advanced price. You can also do deals with the mill up to two years out. I am sorry to take up the time of the Senate but we have to get through this bill.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To those individuals in the wool industry who generously gave their time to provide information to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee, I thank them very much. It should be placed on the record that the federal government is well aware of the crisis which is currently facing the wool industry. A day rarely goes by without some member of the community raising the plight of the wool industry with my officers. The government, through the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr John Anderson, and I will continue to examine the options which will alleviate and overcome the current crisis in the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the current prices remain below the cost of production for the majority of producers, there are indications which would suggest that prices will increase further in the near future. Pipeline stocks are currently at very low levels, and it has been predicted by the IWS that demand and prices are likely to increase. It would be great if that were to happen. Consistent price increases for final wool since the beginning of the year would suggest that there are many areas that may give price relief in the near future for the higher micron categories of the market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996 currently before the parliament is a package covering three key areas: offshore mining licences, poultry industry administrative arrangements and wool industry issues. These are all very important industries for Australia. The wool <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2137"> industry provisions have attracted motions of amendment, and many of the issues raised are covered in the second reading speech. Nonetheless, I would like to add a few of the following comments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I again thank Senator Collins for his contribution. Industry can draw some solace from the fact that this bill has received the full support of the Australian Labor Party and the coalition government. However, it must be said that I am surprised and disappointed by Senator Woodley's comments in this debate. Many of his comments demonstrate a complete naivety and lack of understanding of the magnitude of the problems currently confronting the wool industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Woodley stated that the amendments proposed in this bill had been described by the government as being the `panacea' to the problems of the wool industry. At no stage did the minister or any representative of this government make such a ridiculous statement. The problems which currently beset the industry are of an enormous proportion. As Senator Collins noted, how easy it would be if the problems of the wool industry could be simply solved by changes to Wool International.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Woodley' statements of this nature do nothing to assist this beleaguered industry. They only serve to demonstrate the naivety and complete ignorance of the Democrats and their inability to address problems of national importance. Yet Senator Woodley went further. He again attacked Wool International for their failure to appear before the Senate legislative committee. As had already been noted on a number of different occasions by a number of different members, Wool International provided a written submission to the committee and officers of Wool International were also present at the first night of hearings. Not at any stage during the hearings did Senator Woodley call for Wool International to provide evidence, yet he persists in denigrating this organisation for their failure to appear. I and many other members of this chamber keenly await to hear Senator Woodley's explanation for his continued denigration of Wool International.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments moved by Senator Woodley are fundamentally directed towards the independence of Wool International Holdings from Wool International. He is first proposing to do this through specifying clearly how and which directors can be appointed to Wool International Holdings. In principle, we agree that there should be independence of Wool International Holdings in its operations. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has made it clear on several occasions that he will be looking very carefully at the independence issue in any consideration of such a proposal. However, there are significant problems in what Senator Woodley is proposing. It involves government in the process when government is working to withdraw from industry intervention. It also has the effect of applying these conditions to other matters which are not necessarily the subject of the amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think Senator Woodley would be well aware of the government's record when it was involved in the wool industry. This government will not entertain any ideas of involving itself when, at the May round table discussions, it was quite clear that the industry wanted to be master of its own destiny and its own dynasty. Senator Woodley now wants to drag the government back into it. I have sat on committees with Senator Woodley, and I cannot understand his reasoning for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Woodley's amendment also provides for funding of the Wool International Holdings program to be by way of an interest&hyphen;free loan. As I understand it, this is aimed at ensuring that ultimate ownership of the $24 million is in the hands of wool growers. The wool industry generally accepted the provision that the section 51 funds, which are to be used to fund the Wool International Holdings program, would be available as seed capital for development work by Wool International. This is contrary to Senator Woodley's proposed amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments to be moved by Senator Woodley are reflected in his dissenting report contained in the report of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee on its consideration of this bill. The Senate committee recommended the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2138"> bill be agreed to without amendment. No member dissented from that report except Senator Woodley. Senator Woodley, I sincerely hope that the lack of understanding and ignorance which has been demonstrated by your arguments in relation to this important bill do not come to characterise the Democrats' performance on other nationally important pieces of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Woodley also raised a number of questions concerning the Australian Animal Health Council, the AAHC. Senator Woodley asked: what contributions do other parties make? Other contributing parties are the Cattle Council of Australia, the Sheepmeat Council of Australia, the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation, the Pork Council of Australia, the Australian Chicken Meat Federation, the Australian Egg Industry Association, the Australian Horse Council, all state and territory governments, and the Commonwealth government. Funding contributions are on the basis of one-third each&mdash;Commonwealth, states/territories and industry&mdash;with funding of non-industry involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Woodley also asked: what was the role and purpose of the AAHC? The AAHC has the task of ensuring that animal health services in Australia are adequate to ensure Australia can meet to a high standard the requirements of domestic and international markets for livestock products. Finally, Senator Woodley asked whether the AAHC was filling gaps caused by state closures of laboratories. As mentioned in the answer to the previous question, the AAHC is assessing as a matter of urgency the overall adequacy of animal health services on a national basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments proposed by Senator Margetts would have the effect of setting the disallowance period after the tabling of an instrument of approval made under the Wool International Act 1993 by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy to 15 days. Under parliamentary procedure, that gives a senator 15 sitting days after tabling to give notice of a motion to disallow the instrument. It then gives the Senate a further 15 days to resolve the motion, which must be debated, called on or withdrawn. Potentially there is a total of 30 sitting days. The current session <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will not have been long enough for that to have happened. There is a precedence in legislation for shorter disallowance periods than the 15 days. I consider the provision in the bill for three days to be reasonable and appropriate. I therefore reject the senator's amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, may I just add that should this bill be delayed there would be serious implications for the wool industry, particularly in relation to the wool tax. If the wool tax is not set to zero before 1 July 1996, each wool grower stands to forgo approximately $3,000 in the 1996-97 financial year. In relation to mining licences, all licences currently issued could potentially be challenged should this bill be delayed any further. On the basis of these factors, I reject Senator Woodley's and Senator Margetts's proposed amendments and encourage this chamber to pass the bill without amendment.</PARA>

<PARA>In speaking to these amendments I want to cite a number of pieces of evidence from responsible farming bodies presented to the committee. It is in response to the concerns that they raised that these amendments are placed before the chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first one is a comment by the Western Australian Farmers Federation and comes from their written submission. It states that `the federation supports the proposed Wool International Holdings trial', which will be run over two years. However, it states that the Western Australian Farmers Federation `requires the proposed funding of $24 million to be provided to Wool International Holdings in the form of a commercial loan'. That is what underlines my amendment No. 3.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That matter was raised by quite a number of other witnesses. Rather than go through all of those again and list them, I will leave that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for members of this chamber to do so at their leisure. But it was clearly stated by the Western Australian Farmers Federation and by others that that is how they would see this subsidiary company of Wool International proceeding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Pastoralists and Graziers Association of Western Australia also underline the same preference on their part for the way in which Wool International Holdings would operate. I read from their written submission:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These funds [the monies earned from non-wool assets] are beneficially owned by wool taxpayers by virtue of their equity in Wool International. It has been stated by the management of Wool International that because these funds are not actually the non-wool assets but only that derived from them, then such monies do not belong to growers.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This would have to be a first in the investment world where the earnings derived from an asset are not beneficially owned by the owner of the asset.</PARA>
<PARA>You would agree with that, I am sure. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the board of Wool International is convinced that it has a good prospect for a private enterprise company to operate in the forward physical and derivative markets, then it should put such a proposal into the market place and seek risk capital to write the prospectus. The prospectus should show all necessary detail . . . </PARA>
<PARA>A number of the various items that should be in any prospectus are listed. The Pastoralists and Graziers Association of Western Australia go on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This could then be offered for public subscription and those who are convinced of its merits can invest. In this way all due diligence is seen to have been exercised and sound business practice has been carried out, as is required of any prospective company in the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA>The South Australian Farmers Federation, in their written submission to the hearing of the committee, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The SA Farmers' Federation is very concerned that the operations of WIH are and are seen to be totally independent from Wool International's commercial activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is probably inevitable that there will be some suspicion of WIH having inside knowledge of WI's <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2140"> stockpile selling activities, and this perception must be minimised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We understand the exact composition of a board of management for WIH has not yet been decided and we would urge that the wall between WIH and WI is built very carefully. Strong arrangements must be in place to ensure that WI's selling activities and policies are entirely disconnected from WIH's trading activities.</PARA>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is clear that under the Wool International Act 1993 . . . that wool tax payers were to be entitled to the equity in all the assets of WI, including non-wool assets. Income from non-wool assets `earmarked' under section 51 of the Act and applied for WIH purposes should create a corresponding asset in WI. Section 51 does not contemplate a diversion of equity from stockpile wool tax payers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The structural arrangements of . . . WIH must ensure that the spirit of the Act is maintained in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA>A press release of the Inland Woolbrokers Association Ltd states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Inland Woolbrokers Association Limited today announced its full support for the New South Wales Stud Merino Breeders Association's "Motion" presented to the woolgrowers of NSW.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Inland Woolbrokers Association, representing 35% of the NSW wool clip, can confirm the unrest amongst wool growers which the massive "Yes" vote has indicated.</PARA>
<PARA>I need to explain to the chamber what the question referred to is. This is a ballot which has been published in many of the rural papers and has been put to a number of meetings of wool growers around Australia. The proposal is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Government be asked to legislate to alter the fixed selling schedule of the stockpile immediately in favour of a more commercially flexible selling strategy and that interest and holding costs be met from the sale proceeds.</PARA>
<PARA>For the interest of the chamber, a number of meetings have been held and a number of wool growers have voted yes to that proposal. I can place on the record the numbers voting. At the  meeting in Wedderburn, 389 wool growers voted yes and 30 wool growers voted no. At the meeting in Jerilderie, 559 wool growers voted yes and 27 wool growers voted no and there were seven informal votes. At Dubbo, 1,298 wool growers voted for change <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and 59 were against. I simply place those numbers on the record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Brownhill suggests that I am naive. That may be so, Senator Brownhill, but I have listened to many wool growers in this nation and whether you like it or not I think the evidence is becoming fairly overwhelming that the position taken by the government and the Labor Party in this regard is certainly in question. I think it would behove you to take note of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In answer to Senator Brownhill and Senator Collins, who attacked me on a couple of issues relating to the amendments which I have moved and relating to whether or not I invited Wool International to the hearings, in the Selection of Bills Committee proposal I certainly requested submissions and evidence from Wool International, the Wool Council of Australia, and wool growers from around Australia and I provided names. In discussions between my staff and the Senate committee staff, we were under the misapprehension that in fact Wool International was to appear during the second hearing on the 17th.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to perhaps plead a little naivety in that I did not ask at the second hearing where Wool International was. I was aware that they were present at the first hearing. I made it very clear on a number of occasions that it was certainly my request that we do hear from them and have the opportunity to put questions to them. You will note, Senator Brownhill, that Senator Crane indicated last night that he certainly had requested Wool International to appear. That was his preference and he regretted the fact that they did not appear in person. You can check the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> for yourself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In reference to my assertion that the government and the Labor Party said that this bill was a panacea for the wool industry, I think I do owe you an apology for an overstatement. I do not think the government or the Labor Party did say that. In many of the conversations I had with people who are members of the Wool Council and members of peak bodies, they pleaded with me, `Do not prevent this legislation going through because it is the only hope we've got.' In their mind, this is the hope they have. I am prepared to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2141"> admit that I was not correct in saying that the government and the Labor Party suggested this was a panacea.</PARA>

I certainly would not want to do that, but I have been very critical of them and what I perceive as a failure of Wool International and the Wool Council to take into account sufficiently the concerns raised by many wool growers in Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note&mdash;and let me give Wool International a tick&mdash;that they already have placed before wool growers some suggestions about what would happen to the wool pile after 1 July next year.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that I fully understand why the Greens have moved the amendments in respect of the 15 sitting days. I might also note in passing that there is a Scrutiny of Bills Committee recommendation that this in fact should be done. I note also that the Scrutiny of Bills Committee was unmoved by the response of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Anderson, to it when it pointed out that it was not happy with this particular provision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason that I note this now and I have not noted it before in debate is that this particular matter is really the only one which is different from the legislation that was drafted by the previous government. I noted that small but significant change in the committee hearings. It is noted in the committee's majority report, I think at 1.6. It is that under the previous arrangements&mdash;and Senator Margetts would have been even more unhappy about these&mdash;the minister had the sole power to make such determinations, and they were in fact not subject to disallowance in the parliament. The reason for that&mdash;and I do not resile from it even now in opposition&mdash;was that we believed, because of the desire of everybody to see this experiment succeed, because of the commercial realities of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2142"> marketplace and so on, it was unnecessarily interfering with those commercial realities and that they on balance outweighed the need to bring the matter in here.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason that I make that explanation is to explain that, in my view, as dissatisfied as I am about the government's move to have them disallowed, I would be even unhappier about 15 days than I am with three. I noted in the committee that this change was no doubt brought about by the sterling efforts of people like Senator Brownhill himself and others in prevailing upon the minister that there needed to be a bit of check and balance on his activities. It was in the newspapers at the time, and it may have been very malicious reporting&mdash;there was a scurrilous rumour about at the time&mdash;that there were certain backbenchers, particularly in the National Party, that were not absolutely ecstatic at that time about the minister's performance.</PARA>

<STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(5.44 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As mentioned earlier, the amendments proposed by the Australian Democrats were identical to our proposed amendments. Therefore, we will be supporting their opposition to these items. The proposed amendments had the effect of simply deleting the ability of Wool International to establish a subsidiary such as Wool Holdings International. Item 1 of schedule 6 is the major section under which a subsidiary would be made legally possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The measure is general but it is also fairly explicit that the measure is designed to facilitate the establishment of Wool Holdings International, despite what Senator Crane has said, although there has been no announcement. To set up the mechanism flagged in the explanatory memorandum and then suggest that we have not moved some way down the road to making a decision is a bit naive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As noted on pages 11 to 22 of the committee report, and in the dissenting report, there is considerable resistance amongst woolgrowers to the actions of the Wool Council and its approach to wool trading, futures contracts and the specific plan to establish Wool International Holdings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For all these reasons, we do not think it is appropriate to support this aspect of the legislation at this time. At the same time, we will support other aspects of the legislation, including changes to the contribution requirements and frameworks for Wool International.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So our amendments would simply oppose item 1 of schedule 6, effectively opposing the framework for the establishment of subsidiary companies. We oppose items 5 and 6 because they are consequential on the passage of item 1 dealing with subsidiaries and would make no sense without item 1 as mentioned in the disallowable instrument and its timing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was originally concerned that the Senate would be left with a dilemma about its responsibility to Wool International Holdings or any such body in the future making decisions on such things as futures tradings or hedging, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and that somehow or other the Senate would be brought into that responsibility. Part of this argument, basically, is that the Senate has to take responsibility for giving Wool International Holdings the greatest ability to make quick decisions so that it can conduct this trading.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We thought that the most logical course to take on these unresolved issues is to remove reference to that ability to involve Wool International Holdings in such trading until those issues are resolved. The Senate should not be held responsible one way or the other for the futures trading or hedging of such an establishment. It should not be the role of government to require people to pay a levy and then allow that levy to be used in such speculation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that there is a growing speculation in the world economy. But we do not believe it is right to require a compulsory levy so that somebody else can use that money to involve themselves in such trading. And that is the basis of these three amendments: instead of holding the Senate responsible for what happens to the disallowance, we are deleting that reference as well as the reference to Wool International Holdings because we do not think such reference is appropriate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think I can let this issue pass by without indicating that I have some concern with the three days. Perhaps Senator Brownhill might be able to indicate why I should not have some concern. I would like to flag my concern because if things go wrong in a couple of years time I will be able to say, `Well, I said something about it in the parliament.' Three days is virtually no time because when a regulation is put down it can be three days before people start to have a good look at it; and the three days is gone.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2145">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the moment we usually have 15 sitting days. Towards the end of that 15 sitting days a senator may come into this place and make a statement saying that the regulation be disallowed. There are then 15 sitting days for that. That is what Senator Brownhill was referring to when he mentioned two lots of 15 sitting days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we overlook is that during the initial 15 sitting days and then in the 15 sitting days for disallowance, the regulation still prevails. There is no impediment to the regulation being put into operation during those 30 sitting days, if we are looking at the two lots of 15. Senator Brownhill might be able to indicate to me why we need a three sitting day period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose I am looking at this against a background of having chaired the regulations and ordinances committee, and since the change of government having been the deputy chair. We are looking at a commercial situation at the present time. What the regulations and ordinances committee does when it looks at regulations is not look at the policy aspects&mdash;that is one of the good things about the regulations and ordinances committee; there are never any arguments about policy&mdash;but at whether liberties have been transgressed in any way by the regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know the types of regulations that might be coming down. It might be impossible to transgress on civil liberties with these types of regulations. But with some of the regulations I have seen come through, I would believe that anything could happen. I will certainly be voting with the opposition on this matter but I do want to flag that I have some concern with the three sitting days.</PARA></SPEECH>

So this is not <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a precedent. Those changes were necessary at the time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The major concern would be if the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy were to receive a proposal from Wool International near the end of a sitting period. There could be a waiting time of up to two months before it would be able to be enacted. The disallowance, within the time frame we have suggested, would be able to be handled within the two&hyphen;week sitting period.

I can assure Senator Colston, from personal knowledge, that these regulations will be scrutinised intensely by the wool industry. This has been put up in lights.

<STATE> (Northern Territory)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(6.13 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government in introducing this legislation is using the catchcry of accountability as a pretext for rolling back 25 years worth of hard&hyphen;won improvement in the political status of indigenous people. The number of amendments that we are going to be moving to this bill is not large, however, they do go to the heart of the government's intentions for this bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's approach consists of four main proposals: the appointment of the chairperson of ATSIC; empowering the minister to appoint an administrator over ATSIC's affairs; reducing the number of regional councillors; and measures to improve the accountability of ATSIC regional councils. The opposition opposes the first three proposals, but supports the amendments for greater accountability of regional councils with some reservations as to the appropriate means by which this is to be achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a grave lack of proper consultation between the government and Aboriginal people in regard to this bill. The bill was not at any time made available by the government to Mick Dodson, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, who has a statutory duty under his act&mdash;and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to examine enactments and proposed enactments for the purpose of ascertaining whether they recognise and protect the human rights of Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders and to report to the minister the results of any such examination.</PARA>
<PARA>I stress that the wording of that statute does not relate simply to enactments, that is, actual bills, but also to proposed enactments. I think I speak for the Green and Democrat senators who were present at the Senate committee hearings on Friday&mdash;committee hearings that were extremely useful&mdash;when I say that, in respect of those matters, we were dismayed <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> by the evidence that Mr Dodson gave to the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By the way, in passing, and purely because Senator Boswell is in the chamber, I say to Senator Boswell that I examined the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record after the committee hearing. With regard to the references that drew attention to the position of an administrator in respect of ATSIC and the Wool Corporation, I assure Senator Boswell that if any offence was caused to you by a very flippant comment that I made on my return to the committee, in respect of comparing Aboriginal people with sheep, I do not suggest, having read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, that you suggested that at all. I did tell you that I would withdraw that assertion, and I do so now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to talk about the history that is attached to the appointment of the chair, because reference to the Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> will indicate there is a long history in terms of particular positions that have been taken from time to time by people in the Senate chamber on this very important question and the positions that are being taken now. Reference can be made to things that I said at the time, then representing the government in the Senate, with respect to amendments which we moved to provide the ATSIC board with the power to elect its own spokesperson. I must say I do have a strong position on this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When ATSIC was first established, it was recognised that it was a unique organisation. It was unique then and it remains unique, six or seven years later. At that time it was felt, being so unique, that it was appropriate to proceed with some caution in providing the government with the assurances that it needed to appoint the chair by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I point out in passing that the chief executive officer of ATSIC, rather than the chair, is the person who is responsible, in a real sense, for the day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day accountability of ATSIC. The chair, of course, ultimately is responsible for ATSIC and how it performs, but the day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day accountability of ATSIC is very much in the hands of the chief executive. The chief executive is also appointed by the minister. We are not suggesting that any changes be made to that arrangement. So we are not proposing that the chief executive <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2148"> officer, currently Ms Pat Turner, be appointed by anyone other than the minister. She, or whoever is in that position, arguably would be the person most directly involved in ensuring that ATSIC is properly accountable for the public money that it spends. We have no dispute that that appointment was made by the minister and continues to be made by the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the chair of ATSIC, it must be said, has a multi&hyphen;purpose role. The chief executive is very much responsible for accountability. That would probably constitute the majority, in a real sense, of her job. But the chair of ATSIC has a multitude of responsibilities. Ultimate accountability is only one of them. She is, in a real sense, the political head of the organisation as well&mdash;a role that the CEO does not, and cannot, play.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is right and proper that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission should have a chair who can speak, in a real sense, on behalf of Aboriginal Australia. That is one of the reasons why ATSIC was established in the first place&mdash;to give it that kind of voice and to give the voice the status that the chair of ATSIC has. I find it impossible at this stage in ATSIC's development to agree to a proposition to continue to appoint the chair of ATSIC in this way. I find it to be absolutely irreconcilable with the role that ATSIC is now expected to play.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some people thought I was joking when I made what seemed to me, looking at the words, to be a very obvious comparison, in the committee meeting last Friday. I think it was Commissioner Dodson who drew members' attention to the second reading speech by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron). Listed in that speech were the attributes that should be held by the chair of ATSIC. I drew attention to the fact that the minister was not quoting his own words in that part of the speech but was simply endorsing the attributes that a chair should have. Listed among them was the ability to behave properly in a public place, to be able to conduct themselves&mdash;and I am paraphrasing it, senator, in respect of your outrage&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="HERRON" NAMEID="VW4">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VW4">Senator Herron</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not outrage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator BOB COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But to behave in a responsible manner at major public occasions. Mixing with foreign dignitaries was the term that was used. I said then&mdash;and meant it, as I usually do&mdash;that I actually believed that that was one of the attributes you would expect and, I might add, from my experience with them, which Aboriginal Australia would also expect from their chair.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe&mdash;I am very happy to go on the public record with this&mdash;that we can reasonably impose a greater standard in respect of ATSIC than we impose upon ourselves in parliament. After all, the most senior people in our democratic society are the Prime Minister, the head of the federal government, and, respectively, the premiers of the state governments. In other words, they are leaders, just like the head of ATSIC is a leader. I do not think that we can reasonably expect a better standard of behaviour from the head of ATSIC than we can from the heads of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was not, in fact, a flippant point I was making with my obvious comparison to the </PARA>
<PARA>Premier of Victoria. The point I was making was this: it is obvious that the Prime Minister of Australia from time to time has to deal with premiers&mdash;I am not suggesting the Premier of Victoria is in this boat&mdash;he would much rather not be dealing with. I am quite sure that from time to time the Prime Minister of Australia, irrespective of his political persuasion, would probably like, if he had his druthers, to remove a head of a state government that he finds very irritating, combative, unhelpful and so on. But that, of course, is the role in a democratic society that these people are entitled to take.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, it is not, in my view, open to the government to want to retain the power of appointing the chair of ATSIC because that person, from time to time, might be a person, if they were elected, that the government might find inconvenient or disagreeable. In my view, that is precisely what might happen from time to time in ATSIC, as it happens in respect of the Commonwealth and state leaders around Australia who are democratically elected.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2149">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was only half joking when I asked Commissioner Dodson that question about that major public function attended by international dignitaries. As you know, Senator Herron, there were international dignitaries present from Japan, a country not only important to Australia, but also famous for its protocol. Australian firms spend millions of dollars every year training their executives not to offend the Japanese. That is why I used that example of the head of ATSIC, on a major public occasion in the presence of the same dignitaries, suddenly shovelling sand all over the camera crews that were present. I am not sure what the Japanese word for `idiot' is, but I am sure it got a hell of a workout behind closed doors after that particular event, no matter how much they might have laughed politely at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All I am basically asking is that the same standard be applied to ATSIC as the Commonwealth government would accept has to be applied to political leaders in other organisations, and that is state governments. That is the point that was being made, and I think properly made. I do believe that, if after this length of time ATSIC cannot be trusted to elect its own chief spokesperson&mdash;that is really what we are talking about&mdash;to put a view on behalf of Aboriginal Australia which may, from time to time, be inconvenient for the government, then it is a pretty sad position that we have reached. That is a major issue as far as I and the opposition are concerned. We disagree with this particular legislation, and we will oppose this measure strongly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats, rightly in my view, have had a rethink about it. The reason that that proposal failed on that occasion was that the Democrats were not convinced at that stage, as they now are, that the organisation had now reached that point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question of appointing the administrator over ATSIC's affairs has been canvassed at length before, and I will not waste the time of the Senate by going over that now. That was canvassed in the committee and in other places, so I will not go over that again. The reduction in the number of regional councillors is based on an ATSIC report in February <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 1995 which recommended this reduction in the number of regional councillors and this is the sole basis for the government's decision. The reality is that there are many indigenous people all over Australia who have grave concerns about the effective reduction in the number of regional councillors. The number has already been reduced from 809 to the current 593 following the reduction in the number of regional councils in 1993 from 60 to 36, and no justification has been given for a further reduction either on efficiency grounds or in terms of effective representation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I say to the minister that I do not think that we are diametrically opposed to some consideration being given to a further reduction, but there are clearly concerns about where this might lead to some anomalous situations. I believe that one such situation, from South Australia from memory, was actually given to the committee on Friday. I believe that, whilst at the end of the day I think we may not be too far apart on this issue, there needs to be some additional flexibility to that which the government is currently providing for in this proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So far as the increased accountability for regional councils is concerned, the opposition has said that it will look at constructive amendments to the act, and in terms of these provisions there are some amendments which have merit, and we will not be opposing those amendments. However, we are very concerned that, in a number of cases, the government proposes to remove a non-custodial penalty alternative for certain offences under the act. The reason for our concern is that this stands in direct contravention of recommendation 92 of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody which was that imprisonment should only be used as a punishment of last resort.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sadly, Amnesty International has only very recently pointed to the very unpalatable truth that the number of Aboriginal people dying in custody in Australia has actually increased since the royal commission into that matter was completed, and not decreased. This is not the time, particularly at the federal level, for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2150"> us to be acting in contravention of the recommendations of the commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As people with even a scant interest in this matter would know from the media reports on these events, in so many of these cases, the reason for these continuing deaths in custody is simply that state governments, which are in fact responsible for the prison systems around Australia, simply have not implemented the most basic recommendations&mdash;even the interim recommendations&mdash;of the commission into black deaths in custody. That is a very sad state of affairs. The Labor Party will propose amendments to the bill to ensure that the non-custodial penalty option remains in all of these cases.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are today addressing the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill. I would like to begin by commending the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Senator Herron, for introducing a series of amendments which I know he has based on thorough consultation with the wider community&mdash;and, in particular, those people with specific Aboriginal interests&mdash;and not just on consultation with a few sectional interests that are often focused on so zealously either by the media or by many people in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In many ways, it is a concern to me when issues that so specifically relate to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have to be brought back before this parliament time and time again. Whilst we must always acknowledge the important heritage issues that do apply to the indigenous communities within Australia, it is a concern that so often we are seen to be patronising or paternalistic in many of the endeavours that we undertake in this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we have witnessed over the years, consecutive Labor ministers&mdash;in the last 13 years, in particular&mdash;have ignored the concerns of the broader Aboriginal people, while pandering to the wishes of a select few. This was particularly evident in the period leading up to the introduction of the original ATSIC legislation in 1989. It is now patently obvious <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that the consultation process then was inadequate and failed to accommodate the views of the vast majority of Aboriginal people. At the time, members of the Aboriginal Cultural Foundation, a body located across northern Australia, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After one year of so called consultation, we tribal people have almost no idea what this new commission is about.</PARA>
<PARA>Even the former secretary to the then Department of Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Charles Perkins, claimed the Labor government did not have a mandate from the Aboriginal community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When this legislation was being debated, I made some extrapolations which, with the benefit of hindsight, have proved to be somewhat prophetic. I refer senators to my speech on the second reading debate for the original ATSIC legislation on 17 August 1989, when I made the observation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill is deficient structurally and in detailed drafting, and accountability will not be assured. It has already been quite widely indicated that there will be amendments to this legislation&mdash;considerable amendments that will take some time to deal with&mdash;both from the Opposition and from the Australian Democrats. Sadly it is the Aboriginal people and the general body of Australian taxpayers who will be worst served by ATSIC compared with the existing arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA>A separate quote from that speech continued:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me draw to a conclusion the issues that I see becoming a problem. ATSIC will fail to meet its objectives because of a failure to achieve a consensus amongst the very people the proposal is designed to assist, Aboriginal Australians. Let us all ask the question: What will life be like under ATSIC? The administrative problems seen in the past will only get worse and Aborigines will cop the blame. Racism will be entrenched institutionally&mdash;by, if one can believe it, a Labor Government. The interests of traditional Aboriginal people will be subsumed. There will be a lack of accountability that will be totally confusing if these proposals are adopted.</PARA>
<PARA>That, as I mentioned, is an extract of my comments which appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  on 17 August 1989.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2151"> In 1993 the Labor government decided to introduce a series of reforms in an attempt to redress some of the more obvious flaws in the initial ATSIC legislation. The Labor govern ment was widely criticised at the time for not consulting with the Aboriginal community. When the bill was tabled, I received representations from many groups&mdash;in particular, from the Arltarpilta and Impiyara regional councils in central Australia&mdash;which claimed they had not been consulted at all. I assisted these communities by relaying their specific concerns to the former minister for Aboriginal affairs and to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe it is quite meaningful and coincidental that various Aboriginal leaders from those organisations are here in Canberra at the moment. For the past two days, they have been talking to ATSIC, to departmental officials, to the minister and to others, and they have again been repeating many of their concerns. Yesterday I met with people from the Tea Tree local government community, and they were able to again reinforce and re&hyphen;stress their concerns. That is also an important fact in this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As my fellow senators will recall, the coalition, in conjunction with the Australian Democrats, introduced a series of changes to the former Labor government's amendment bill to make ATSIC more accountable and to make the decision on the new chairman more flexible. However, as was acknowledged at the time, the former government's amendment bill did not go far enough to address the problems inherent in the ATSIC legislation. We are now asked to consider a comprehensive series of amendments proposed by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Senator Herron, in response to the representations of many Aboriginal people across Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 1996 is an important piece of legislation which addresses many of the points Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people have made about ATSIC since it was established. Recent history has shown that the most common criticism of ATSIC is that it needs to be more accountable to the people and the parliament in order to ensure funding is not squandered by the agencies serviced by ATSIC and reaches the Aboriginal people on the ground who need it. The general feeling amongst those who work <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> within or are closely associated with the Aboriginal affairs portfolio is that ATSIC is long overdue for reform or, as one Aboriginal leader suggested, `a well overdue shake&hyphen;up'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposal for the commission chairperson to be appointed by the minister represents an important change in ATSIC's structure. In a situation where large amounts of government funds, taxpayers' funds, are expended, it is of fundamental importance that the government maintain a large degree of control.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I welcome Senator Herron's proposal to open regional council meetings and specified documents to the public. This is an important step towards ensuring that ATSIC is transparent and ultimately accountable to its constituency. In the longer term, this will also ensure Aboriginal people have greater access to the decision making process and the option to inspect documentation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there was one particular aspect of this legislation to which I am attracted, it is that one. From representations that have been made to me over a long period in politics, I am certainly well aware that the decision making process within Aboriginal communities certainly requires transparency. Aboriginal politics is no different to our own. It is fierce. It is partisan. It is led by particular interest groups, often focusing on particular families and clans. Various aspects of the decision making process not being public, not being open, only leads to accusations&mdash;often very false ones&mdash;of nepotism and of undue influence and in many respects leads to poor and inadequate decisions with regard to financial decision making that affects many other people in local communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that, as long as the rules that are being introduced through this legislation broadly reflect those that apply to local government, we will see a vast improvement in the appropriate governmental ATSIC-type decision making processes that are so fundamentally important. I can think of many examples of where I have had to be involved in electorate representational work to redress the issues that Aboriginal constituents have raised with me when the decision making process has frustrated them or has totally gone <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2152"> against what would be a majority decision in many communities or Aboriginal service delivery organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Likewise, I welcome the proposal dealing specifically with electoral matters. Too often block voting on regional councils freezes out small communities from representation and funding. The amendments will severely limit the avenues available to those who wish to employ unscrupulous means to win office and consequently attempt to control the distribution of ATSIC funds to the detriment of the wider community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we look at the history of elections within the various arms and councils of ATSIC and the commission itself and at the very poor turnout in many communities, we see this is not democracy properly working. Not only on an educational level but also as a matter of fairness and equity for many of the Aboriginal people, that electoral matter ought to be properly redressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I envisage the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 1996 will enjoy an overwhelming degree of support in this chamber. Based on the views that Senator Collins has expressed in the past, I am sure that he will prove to be one of the strongest supporters on the opposition benches. I heard part of Senator Collins's speech today and noted the points he raised. He and I share a constituency in the Northern Territory of which Aboriginal people comprise some 25 per cent, and I know we share many issues from both an electoral perspective and a policy perspective. Earlier I dwelt on my own comments of August 1989, but, interestingly, I would like to quote from Senator Collins's speech of 17 August 1989&mdash;and I remind Senator Herron of this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have my own personal views about funding for Aboriginal affairs which I have also expressed many times on the public record. My own view about funding for Aboriginal affairs is that the lion's share of that funding should, in fact, be non-discretionary. Bodies such as ATSIC or, indeed, any other bodies that are created should have no discretion to determine how it is spent at all because, in my view, the lion's share of funding for Aboriginal affairs has to be spent directly on improving the desperate living conditions of many of these people who, without doubt, are the most <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> deprived group of people still existing in the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA>It is interesting that Senator Collins often varies from what he said some five or six years ago and today often takes a different stance, for political reasons or a different agenda, in this type of debate. The comments that Senator Collins made in 1989 in relation to the formation of ATSIC are just as relevant and true today as they were when they were said. This bill will result in a more even balance between the ideal of self-determination and, as I said, Senator Collins's preference for non-discretionary funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many examples of success in areas of Aboriginal affairs and indigenous matters throughout Australia that we should concentrate on. Let me highlight a few. If we look at local government working effectively, then it is with pride that we see in the Northern Territory the great participation of Aboriginal people in the form of local government that applies in most Aboriginal communities, and that is under the Northern Territory local government provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the area of community government where municipal functions of various types are transferred and accepted by the local communities and funded through the Northern Territory government schemes. There are many areas of success in the involvement of Aboriginal people in those communities. Many of them are exclusively Aboriginal and many of them are on a shared and participatory basis with wider communities in which the Aboriginal people have a majority say. Certainly there is that change of local government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased also to notice that there are many other examples of wider Aboriginal involvement in local government throughout Australia. I welcome and encourage that. I believe that is essential if we are to see the proper participation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in all forms and levels of government throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to comment on the increasing participation and the role of women within Aboriginal communities. If there is an equal opportunity banner that is working more successfully than anywhere else, it is in the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2153"> Aboriginal communities, particularly for women aged over 40. As I go into Aboriginal communities I am really pleased to so often note the leadership, the maturity, the control and the influence that Aboriginal women have in community affairs on all the issues, whether it be reflecting social values at a community level or demanding accountability in financial matters. I could highlight many examples of where Aboriginal women's participation outstrips that of their male colleagues in many communities, particularly in the area of responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we look at the record of improvement in Aboriginal education at the tertiary level, we see that there are now many fine examples of people electing to be more involved in advancing their own education. We certainly see an improvement in the provision of facilities by the various tertiary institutions throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many commercial activities, generally of a joint venture nature, that can highlight the participation, the involvement and the commercial maturity of many Aboriginal communities. That equally stands as a test and a challenge for the maturity and involvement of Aboriginal communities. I am well aware that in the Northern Territory the Traditional Credit Union, which has developed in Arnhem Land as an organisation with banking functions, is an area that has special growth and has the special involvement of Aboriginal people specifically.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, again in Arnhem Land, there is the demystification of the decision making process. That word is often bandied around these days to mean many things. But it is interesting that the Northern Territory government has involved Aboriginal consultants in the education of police officers, of court officials, of senior administrators and of educationalists in understanding the culture, the language, the processes and the very different reasons by which Aboriginal people make decisions. But it is a reciprocal matter. In Aboriginal communities there are many examples of how the demystification process attempts to explain to and educate Aboriginal people about the reasons, the traditions and the patterns of how we&mdash;those of us who <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> come from a European heritage&mdash;make decisions and how that applies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe in applying those examples of success&mdash;whether it has been in education, women's participation, local or community government, commercial joint ventures or the demystification of decision making&mdash;so that we can link these things very carefully to this piece of legislation. This legislation attempts to bring together the decision making processes for Aboriginal people on a basis that gives them hope, opportunity, accountability and acceptability within the broader community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I would like to express my optimism for the future of Aboriginal affairs under the coalition government and in particular under the leadership of Senator Herron as the minister. By bringing ATSIC more into line with the accountability regime of other Commonwealth departments, the government will ensure that funding reaches Aboriginal people who really need it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The result of this amendment bill will be a government more responsive to the needs of the broader Aboriginal community. At the same time, we must recognise that so many of these amendments have been sought either because of frustration by inadequate performance or because of the areas of success that need to be specially developed and appropriately brought across to this particular style of legislation. The whole range of provisions and amendments we put forward is very timely.</PARA>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This will certainly be my last opportunity to deal with the Advance to the Minister for Finance. I hope that when I have left this place others might find it useful to pursue issues raised here because it give us an opportunity to establish where the various elements of the bureaucracy may well have failed and perhaps where they could lift their sights a little. For example, $1.6 million is urgently required under this arrangement for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2154"> the Office of Film and Literature Classification, according to the Attorney-General's Department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The explanation is that this is urgent and was erroneously omitted from the appropriation bill as advice was only received by the department on 19 March 1996 that a separate appropriation item would be required. Yet this related to law that was passed last year, as I recall. In order that this expenditure can legally take place under the new item, it is necessary to transfer the appropriation to that item. I guess that is just one of the many examples one keeps seeing of where procedures could be improved. One should not rely on this kind of Advance to the Minister for Finance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There seems to be an extraordinary number of personal injury matters which require compensation and legal expenses for a whole range of departments. For example, the Defence Department requires $14 million for urgent and unforeseen compensation and legal expenses. The last half a dozen of these Advances to the Minister for Finance have seen a very large number of these matters included. I note that they are lumped together as compensation and legal expenses. I think it would be very useful for the parliament to know which were compensation payments and which were legal expenses, particularly when something like $14 million, in this case, is involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another matter I wanted to raise was a something I questioned with the last Advance to the Minister for Finance relating to the State Electricity Commission of Victoria lodging claims against the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation and the Murray-Darling Rural Water Commission following an accident at the Dartmouth Dam power station in May 1990. The request tabled today says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Advice from the Principle Solicitor for the Australian Government Solicitor indicated that it was in the best interest of the Commonwealth to agree to contribute $8,500,000 towards the settlement.</PARA>
<PARA>At the end of the request, it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There may be a need for another request for AMF before the end of the financial year. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>I think it is about time parliament was told what is the full cost to this government in having to pick up what appears to be some kind of significant error emerging out of the previous administration. Is it going to be a great deal or not? After all, $8.5 million so far is a very considerable amount by which the government has to stand behind one of its government business enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also noticed the Australian Taxation Office requires $2.48 million in compensation and legal expenses. I have already mentioned this in relation to another department. I an wondering why we keep on seeing so many understatements of what is required. For example, current claims on hand of $533,000 and expected expenditure for the remainder of the financial year of $2.65 million seem to suggest a whole range of legal problems with the Australian Taxation Office. I think in previous Advances to the Minister for Finance similar large amounts have been made available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also intrigued to see in the last Advance to the Minister for Finance an extraordinary situation where one department eventually settled and it is going to cost $140,000&hyphen;odd in legal costs. I know this is a great problem and hard to forecast, but it does not seem to be being done too well. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>I want to note some of the incidental costs of elections. I notice the Department of Administrative Services requires an extra $5.576 million to cover larger redundancy costs and so on relating to former staff of ministers, office holders and back bench parliamentarians&mdash;positions which have been terminated as a result of the election. These payments so far exceed $6 million. I know that the staff would have been concerned about the loss of their jobs. It seems obviously appropriate that there should be proper payment to them for the loss of their jobs. It is one of those hidden <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2155"> costs of a change in government that comes to light in these documents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to mention another item. The Department of Veterans' Affairs requires a further $1.36 million for the veterans' children education scheme to meet some payments due to the increase in student numbers at both the secondary and tertiary level of education. This requirement was unforeseen at the time of the additional estimates. I know it must be very difficult to establish what these total costs are going to be, but I must say that $1.36 million on top of an appropriation of $6.5 million is a fairly large percentage error. I wonder on what basis these mistakes are being made, if you can call them mistakes. Obviously, the payments have to be made. I certainly would not complain about those payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One final thing is that on Friday, 21 April this year, the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, ASIS, took out a series of injunctions against the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> and radio station 2UE. The injunctions were proceeded with but the Commonwealth government is liable to some costs as it has accepted a final settlement involving the payment of $100,000 to John Fairfax Pty Ltd. The ASIS component of this cost is $33,333.34. The account is currently to hand. Unrelated compensation and legal payments of $78,504 and $7,679 have already been paid from the Advance to the Minister for Finance as the final charge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This matter clearly indicates that there is a cost to these ventures, and the taxpayer has to pay it. I imagine that John Fairfax is quite happy to be receiving $100,000 in settlement of this matter. I know that John Fairfax, who employed me at one stage in my life, could have thought of some very good ways of spending that kind of money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is just another example of legal action taking a very large amount of government money. Multi&hyphen;millions of dollars seem to be going out from various departments in either legal settlements or compensations. It is a matter of concern that the Commonwealth government appears to be one of the major providers of funding to the legal profession in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to place before the parliament a matter on behalf of Letty Scott, a member of the Aboriginal community who sadly lost her husband in 1985 at Berrimah prison near Darwin in the Northern Territory. His death was recorded as another statistic in what we call `deaths in custody'. However, there is conflicting evidence about the cause of death, and Mrs Scott has asked me to tell the parliament that she strongly believes that her husband was murdered and that she rejects any conclusion that he committed suicide.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I simply am not in a position to know definitively what occurred, but the point that Mrs Scott wants to make is that this is a complex issue. She believes that all of the evidence should be placed before an open judicial inquiry so that the matter may be considered fully and any new evidence examined. I have a copy of a letter that she and her solicitors have sent to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) outlining the basis of her case. I will just take a moment to detail some of the concerns that Mrs Scott raises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Mrs Scott says that there are witnesses who are prepared to come forward under privilege to give new evidence; that there are discrepancies in the original polaroid photographs taken; that some of the evidence given to the royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody should be reviewed and retested; that evidence should be sought from other people with knowledge of the circumstances of the death in question; that there is conflicting evidence about the time of death and conflicting evidence about the body temperature, ranging from prison officers stating that the deceased was stone cold through to ambu lance reports stating that his body was still warm.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She further states that there are questions about the use of the stool, which was assumed at the time to be used by the deceased to stand on, with a recent measurement of the cell and a photo taken at the time, perhaps showing discrepancies in previous evidence; that there was conflicting evidence about the presence or absence of blood in the room; that there are allegations of conflicting photos of the neck and throat injuries of the deceased; and that there are differing descriptions of how the deceased was taken down and laid on the bed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mrs Scott claims that the photos shown to her and her daughters in March in Darwin were quite different from those shown to her in Brisbane several years later; that differences include the presence or absence of a pattern on the sheet, the distance of the deceased's head to the ceiling and the feet to the floor, and the number of knots in the sheet; and that an occupant of the gaol cell opposite claimed he saw four prison officers with batons enter the cell of the deceased and heard subsequent cries for help from him.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She claims that there are claims from a person who alleges he found blood on the sheet, pillow and floor of the deceased's cell the next day and that there are claims from another prisoner who heard a cry for help from the deceased and who says that he saw a mattress with blood on it carried from the deceased's cell the next day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said earlier, I am not qualified to judge whether the deceased hanged himself or was murdered.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RE: THE ABORIGINAL PERSON WHO DIED IN CUSTODY AT BERRIMAH PRISON NEAR DARWIN, NORTHERN TERRITORY ON 5 JULY 1985</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have had the instructions of Mrs Letty Scott in connection with matters arising from the death of her husband, while in custody at Berrimah Prison near Darwin, Northern Territory on 5 July 1985. From the material which has been provided to us and which we have reviewed, we have arrived at the view that there are now serious reasons to doubt the outcome and conclusions of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, as regards this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the view already expressed, it is our submission that this is an appropriate case for the re&hyphen;opening of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody to take further evidence and review certain issues and materials previously put before it. For reasons which are outlined below, we believe this is the only appropriate action to take which will serve the interests of justice, the interest of the community including the Aboriginal community and the interests of the family of the deceased.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because of the nature of the matter and of the continual efforts over many years of Mrs Scott to draw these matters to the attention of authorities, we believe this is not a matter which should now be referred to the Northern Territory Police. Upon the evidence presented to us including the evidence of persons who were in a position to see and to hear certain things, it would appear that, quite contrary to the evidence and the conclusions of the Royal Commission, there was an involvement on the part of four prison officers on the night in question, which has never been the subject of inquiry or evidence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We would also urge that the names of the witnesses whose statements are referred to in this submission should be protected from disclosure until the holding of the Inquiry sought or until their permission is obtained. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Taken together, the new evidence such as the statements of Messrs Percy and Bindai together with Mrs Scott's account of the differences between the original two polaroid photographs taken by a prison officer on the morning of discovery of the death of the deceased and what purported to be copies of those photographs subsequently shown to her will, in our submission, lead to the need to advance a number of theories and lines of inquiry before a re&hyphen;opened Royal Commission which could not otherwise be undertaken without privilege.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In our submission the appointment of an investigator or rapporteur will not be a sufficient response to Mrs Scott's plea for an inquiry and in particular.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i) Such a person would have no powers of subpoena, power to compel witnesses to answer, and authority to report publicly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii) An adverse report from such an investigator recommending no further action is not likely to satisfy Mrs Scott nor to resolve the issues satisfactorily.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A full judicial inquiry is the only appropriate response for the following reasons:&hyphen;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i) Some of the evidence already given before the RCIADC requires review and further testing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii)_ The new evidence as to photographs, Messrs Percy and Bindai in particular and others whose evidence may not have been sought or if sought, not dealt with appropriately, as apparently in the case of Bindai, must be dealt with properly, with all interested parties having an opportunity to test it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iii) Mrs Scott should be given the resources to have some of the existing evidence thoroughly examined and tested by forensic experts. In particular independent forensic pathologists and photographic experts may need to be employed to report and then to give evidence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iv) Only a full judicial inquiry will have the necessary authority to deal with and review the findings and methodology of the Royal Commission which preceded it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(v) Only a further open judicial inquiry will have the authority to settle the issues remaining outstanding to the satisfaction of Mrs Scott, and the wider community of people whose anxiety and doubts about the RCIADS findings would otherwise fester and undermine public confidence in its findings.</PARA>

The noose could have been tied earlier or could then have been tied. It would then be a matter of stepping off the table. Death would follow very quickly.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.7 A perusal of one of the photographs purporting to be a copy of the polaroid photograph taken by PO BIRBECK which shows the deceased from the rear discloses what appears to be the top of the stool in the foreground next to the bed. The perusal of another of the police photographs shows the stool at the end of and to the side of the bed upon which the deceased was laid out. DR LEE viewed the polaroid photographs at the prison on the day of death and became aware from the original polaroid photograph that the stool was not in a position to be used by the deceased. Nevertheless in his post mortem report (P1 paragraph 3) DR LEE states "the ceiling height is 266cm and the height of the stool that he was standing on was 44cm".</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">D.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The statement of RC JOHNSTON that "once suspended there was no object that could be reached with hands or feet" appears on the face of it, incorrect.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">6. The Question of the Photographs</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.1 During March of 1989 in about the first week of the Royal Commission Inquiry into the death of the deceased a meeting was held, attended by staff of the Royal Commission and members of the family of the deceased.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.2 The meeting took place at the Darwin Magistrates Court Building on the Corner of Nicholls Place and Bennett Street in Darwin. The meeting was attended by Geoffrey Barbaro, solicitor assisting the Royal Commissioner, Mick Dodson, counsel assisting the Royal Commissioner and Letty Scott, Diana Cavanagh and Michelle Mosley. These persons Scott, Cavanagh and Mosley are the immediate family of the deceased. Letty is his widow and Diana and Michelle his daughters. At the meeting the immediate family were shown two polaroid photographs being photographs showing the deceased hanging in his cell. The specific features of the photographs according to the clear recollection of Scott, Cavanagh and Mosley are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.2.1 The deceased was hanging by a plain sheet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.2.2 The sheet which was around the neck of the deceased had five slip knots, and the sheet was very tightly twisted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.2.3 The feet of the deceased were at least two feet (24  inches) from the ground.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.2.4 The head of the deceased appeared to be on a very close proximity to the ceiling of the cell.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.2.5 There was no chair, stool or any other item observable in the photograph. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.3. During the Royal Commission Hearing 22 photographs were tendered into the evidence during the evidence of Prison Office I.W. Birbeck on the 30th March, 1989. Those 22 photographs were identified as Exhibit NT/7/71. The tender of the 22 photographs can be seen at page 544 of the Transcript of the Royal Commission Hearings. Of the total of the 22 photographs 2 were seen to be photographs of the deceased hanging in his cell.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.4 During August 1993 Letty Scott together with another  attended at the office of her then solicitor, Mr Paterson of the firm Stockley and Company in Brisbane. At that meeting Letty Scott was shown copies (but original photographs) of Exhibit NT/7/71. We are instructed that the photographs showing the body of the deceased hanging by his neck in his prison cell on the 5th July, 1985 were quite different in most respects from those photos which Letty Scott and her daughters had seen during the meeting in Darwin in March 1989. The</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">differences were as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.4.1. The sheet around the neck of the deceased was patterned with trains and boats and planes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.4.2. The body was hanging some observable distance from the ceiling of the cell.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.4.3. The feet of the deceased were situated one or two inches only away from the floor (in the copy photograph they appear to be touching the floor).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.4.4. There was near the floor some sort of elevated platform which appears to be a stool.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.4.5. There was one knot only in the sheet around the neck of the hanging body of the deceased.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.5 Since Letty Scott observed these photographs at the office of her Solicitor she has developed a justifiable concern and even conviction that the true circumstances of the handling of the deceased has not been explained. Certainly, on one view of it the body was hanging, or found to be hanging, on two separate occasions in the cell. But the Royal Commission Inquiry did not elicit any evidence whatsoever that the body of the deceased was rehung after his body was found hanging in the cell. The evidence, so far as it is relevant, is that Prison Officers Lawson and Robertson were instructed and did release the body of the deceased from its hanging position and lay it on the bed after the body had been photographed by Prison Officer Birbeck.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.6 Attached to this Submission are copies of the original photographs being copies of Exhibit NT/7/71 referred to herein.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.7 There was never any explanation of the appearance of the hanging body of the deceased in photographs seen by Letty Scott and her family in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2161"> Darwin and those produced to her through her solicitors in Brisbane.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.8 This aspect of inquiry alone raises, in our respectful submission sufficient doubt for the purpose of instituting and undertaking some inquiry on this aspect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.9. Rodney Lewis, Solicitor, has spoken at some length to Geoffrey Barbaro concerning this matter but Geoffrey Barbaro is unable to agree that the photographs which were tendered into evidence at the Royal Commission Hearing (NT/7/71) are, insofar as they show the hanging body of the deceased different from the photographs where he showed Letty Scott and her family in Darwin during the Royal Commission Hearing. The lack of any satisfactory explanation for the differences adds, in our submission, to the need for a search for a proper explanation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.10 Another matter involving Mr Barbaro arises from information received by Mr Rodney Lewis from Mr Robert Cavanagh, now senior lecturer in the Faculty of Law at the University of Newcastle, and formerly counsel to Mrs Scott. He has advised of a conversation he had with Mr Barbaro and after that conversation telling Mrs Scott&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Barbaro just told me that he did show you the polaroid photographs at the beginning of the Royal Commission Inquiry and he says those photographs are different from the Territory Police photographs."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Cavanagh also advises that:&mdash;"I do recall discussing with Mr Barbaro the issue of Mr Scott being hung twice and recall Barbaro being concerned that that may have happened."</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.11 Any inquiry would, in our submission, seek to locate the originals of the polaroid photographs which were taken by Chief Prison Officer Birbeck. Inquires have been made continually over the years by Mrs Scott as to the whereabouts of the polaroid photographs. Most recently, a request has been made and acted upon by your department to search the records held of this matter. A thorough search of all the records was made in August 1993 without success. However, the file of the Coronial Inquest had already been returned to the Coroner's Office in Darwin on 20 April 1993. A recent written enquiry of that office has produced the written response by the Coroner's Clerk, Mr Arkinstall, that the file was indeed returned to the Office of the Coroner in April 1993 but "does not contain the two original polaroid photographs. . .

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">7. The Observations of Jeffrey Bindai</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">7.1 One of the exhibits tendered during the course of the Royal Commission Inquiry was a Statement of J. Bindai and identified with Exhibit Marking NT/7/101. We have undertaken at the Doon Doon Station via Kunnunurra in Western Australia specific inquiries as to the circumstances <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the taking of the Statement by Counsel assisting the Royal Commission with Mr Bindai on the 4th day of April, 1989. It is sufficient for the purposes of this submission to indicate that Mr Bindai now claims that the account put into evidence is only a partial statement of what he told the representatives of the Royal Commission and does not contain the whole account of what he said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">7.2 Mr Bindai has much of significance to provide as to those events at the time of the death of the deceased. Specifically they are these matters:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">LEWIS 3</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">7.2.1. Mr Bindai was at the Darwin Gaol as a prisoner for a period of about two months before the 5th July, 1985, the day on which the deceased was found hanging in his cell.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">7.2.2. Mr Bindai occupied a cell in C Block directly opposite from the cell occupied, at the time of his death, by the deceased.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">7.2.3. On the evening before the 5th July, 1985 Bindai was placed in his cell at about 8 o'clock and much later that evening he heard a sound, looked out of his cell and saw four Prison Officers, carrying batons, enter the cell of the deceased. According to Mr Bindai he heard Scott calling out for help and he heard sounds coming from the cell.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">7.2.4. Mr Bindai claims that other prisoners adjacent to the cell of the deceased shouted out and made comments concerning what was then taking place inside the cell of the deceased.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">7.2.5. Mr Bindai claims at some point during the time that the Prison Officers were in the cell of the deceased, one of them came out and made a threat to Mr Bindai before returning to the others in the cell of the deceased.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">7.2.6. Mr Bindai claims that the deceased was further assaulted by the Prison Officers inside his own cell.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">7.2.7. Mr Bindai claims that the Prison Officers, after being in the cell for some time left it and walked away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">7.2.8. Rodney Lewis has recently interviewed Mr Bindai at his home in Western Australia and has confirmed again the substance of his story.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">8. The Observations of Laurie Percy</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">8.1 During an interview which Rodney Lewis had with Mr Laurie Percy at Darwin recently he indicated that on the morning Mr Scott's body was found in the cell he was asked to go in and clean up cell. In the course of cleaning of the cell he saw blood on the sheet, pillow and on the floor of the cell. He also found blood on a ball of paper underneath the toilet.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Issues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A. The amount of blood which Percy now says he saw in the cell is in stark contrast to the refer <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2162"> ence to blood in his original statement. At all events, even the reference in his original statement to blood was not subject of any enquiry or discussion before the Royal Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">9. The Observations of Geoffrey Moreen</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">9.1 Geoffrey Moreen is the brother of Laurie Percy and both were in cells opposite that of the deceased on the night and morning in question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">9.2 Mr Moreen, in a recent conversation with Rodney Lewis in Darwin, made a statement which included the following: "I remember hearing in the night Kelly called out:&hyphen; "Somebody help me" but I thought I was dreaming and I didn't do anything.".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">9.3 The reference to "Kelly" is a reference to the deceased. Apparently Mr Scott was also known by that name at least to Mr Moreen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">9.4 Mr Moreen also states that on the following morning he saw Laurie Percy and Geoffrey Bindai carrying the mattress from the cell in the course of cleaning it. He says he saw blood on the mattress.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">11.2 The bed sheets depicted in the photographs of the deceased have a pattern of trains, boats and planes. Not only does this not record with her recollection of the plain white sheet in the photograph she saw in Darwin but there is the real question of whether they were at that time regulation prison issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">11.3 The same question arises from the clothing of the deceased as depicted in the photographs and whether or not that was at that time regulation prison issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both of these issues have been sources of great anxiety and should be settled by proper evidence. Neither was raised at the inquest or at the RCIADC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">11.4 Mrs Scott remains unconvinced that a person of the height and build of the deceased could have reached the grate in bare feet in order to tie and twist the sheet by which he was hanged. A description of the knot and sheet was produced by PO Robertson, in a statement taken on 8 March 1989 for the RCIADC (p5).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">11.5 Only a full and careful reconstruction and re&hyphen;enactment of the event will resolve Mrs Scott's anxiety. She is not satisfied that the visit to the cell by RC JOHNSTON accomplished that purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">11.6 Mrs Scott had a telephone conversation with PO Bowden (then retired) on 7th October, 1994. During that conversation Mrs Scott's instructions are that the following exchange took place:&hyphen; "Your husband didn't die of strangulation like Dr Lee put down, he died of a broken neck."</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">11.7 The notion that the deceased died of a broken neck did not figure at all in any of the evidence given at the Inquest or at the RCIADC. It is a serious issue and on which needs to be pursued.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">11.8 The photograph of the deceased taken full rear view hanging shows his feet without any sign of drooping. In other words they appear to be on the ground. This seems to Mrs Scott a curious way in which someone might hang themselves, with feet on the ground.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Taken another way, the evidence from PO ROBERTSON is that the deceased's feet were <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2163"> about 2 inches off the ground.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">11.12 It is of significance and in our submission a serious lapse of duty of the RCIADC that the inquiry into the death of the deceased began with the tendentious assumption that there was no culpability on the part of the prison officers in the incident. Such an assumption, even though with the agreement apparently of all parties, predicated an outcome which, with the benefit of having the matters now available as further evidence and debate upon the issues put in this submission, was simply not warranted if a proper and thorough forensic inquiry was undertaken.</PARA>

Since there was, according to the Royal Commissioner, no knowledge of the instructions of the defendant (deceased) he has concluded, without the benefit of evidence on this point, that the deceased was lawfully in custody.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australia does many things very well. In a range of fields&mdash;academic, sporting and scientific&mdash;we lead the world. Tonight I would like to briefly refer to the sad situation that now faces Australian research in science, particularly in respect of the field of astronomy. Research into space&mdash;astronomy&mdash;is one area where Australia, even though a small country of 18 million people, is a world leader. </PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2164">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had the good fortune during the Easter break to visit the Mount Stromlo observatory, which was something I had not done since I was a small child. Like anybody who gets that opportunity, I found it fascinating to be up there and to tour around the observatory in the company of Professor Jeremy Mould and Professor Vincent Ford, two outstanding Australian astronomers, and to see the work that is being carried out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said once before in this chamber&mdash;and it bears repeating&mdash;one of the most significant pieces of research that is being carried out at the Mount Stromlo observatory is a program over some five years into researching black holes in space. There has been a lot of talk in this chamber, day in and day out, about black holes in budgets, but that rhetoric pales into insignificance beside the real work that is being done quietly but effectively not so very far away from here at Mount Stromlo observatory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is of concern to Australia's scientists, particularly those involved in astronomy and space research, that they could well be facing major cuts in funding to that vitally important work. We are already aware that in May the Minister for Science and Technology, Mr McGauran, stopped funding for the project known as the 2dF telescope. I would not attempt to explain the intricate detail of that project. Whilst I am fascinated by matters dealing with astronomy&mdash;that interest has been rekindled since my visit&mdash;I do not have anywhere near the expertise or the technical knowledge to outline the details. But there was an excellent article produced in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> review on 1 and 2 June this year entitled `Big bang politics: the black hole facing Australia's highest profile science.' This was an article by Helen O'Neill and I urge all senators to read it. It notes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian astronomers are on the verge of a breakthrough&mdash;mapping the 3D structure of the universe, neck and neck with a larger US team. Their reward? The government is going to stop them in their tracks.</PARA>
<PARA>What was happening&mdash;and this was a project which was fully supported by the previous Labor government&mdash;was that Australian&hyphen;based astronomers and scientists at the Anglo&hyphen;Australian Observatory in Sydney were <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> engaged in developing a piece of equipment known as a 2dF telescope, or two&hyphen;degree field telescope, which would enable scientists effectively to gain far better exposures and peer deeper into space, to look at what is happening out there in terms of what are known as red shifts of galaxies. That data is of fundamental importance in looking at such questions as the age of the universe and of the earth, and so on. With one fell swoop in May, Minister McGauran cut that funding. I quote again from the article:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Last month, Science Minister Peter McGauran sent astronomers a letter asking that negotiations to join the European Southern Observatory stop. The future of astronomy lies in 8m telescopes&mdash;the ESO is building the world's largest reflecting telescope in Chile&mdash;and astronomers here want access.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">McGauran said that the Government would not provide the $30 million over five years that ESO membership required. The previous Labor government had agreed to accept the ESO invitation in February. </PARA>
<PARA>The work done by the Sydney team was an integral part of that combined project. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rationale was the Coalition's own black hole, the $8 billion Budget deficit. According to a spokeswoman from the minister's office, the Government `just can't afford it at the present time'. Money for other astronomy projects and ongoing funding has not been affected, she says, adding that future participation of ESO remains a possibility.</PARA>
<PARA>That is very small comfort, given what we have heard and what is becoming clearer each day on this government's massive expenditure cuts in areas of education. For instance, the Mount Stromlo observatory funding comes directly from funding through the Australian National University. So those assurances must ring hollow indeed. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even so, astronomers' reactions have been unequivocal. A total of 84 scientists from Australia, the US and the Netherlands signed a letter, published in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS>  two weeks ago, protesting against the decision. Others became individually vocal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">`The initial planning on how to use the telescope will essentially leave us out,' says Professor Jeremy Mould, director of the Mount Stromlo and Siding Spring Observatory. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2165"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">`If Australian governments treat their best scientists in this way, what are the prospects for science as a whole?'</PARA>
<PARA>No lesser an eminent Australian than Sir Gustav Nossal has criticised the decisions made by this current government and the Minister for Science and Technology on the withdrawal of this funding. Anyone who knows or knows of Gus Nossal knows that he is a gentleman, one of the world's leading experts in medical science and a man whose opinion must be accepted as both genuine and based upon fact. The article quotes Gus Nossal:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sir Gustav Nossal, president of the Academy of Science, stresses that the Government made election promises on research and development, which he expects to be honoured. All announcements are being left for the August 20 Budget, he says, adding: `I would draw the conclusion that Australian science is in for tough times.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">According to Nossal, Australian astronomers have been at the forefront of the field since World War II. Ironically, it is exactly the calibre of work being done now that prompted the ESO offer.</PARA>
<PARA>For many engaged in the cut and thrust of politics, economic debate and all those other matters that are of such vital importance to us, sometimes the importance and the impact of the work being done by small but eminent groups of scientists in this country, leading the world in space research and astronomy, gets forgotten, gets pushed aside. This is most unfortunate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I regret the minister's decision. I would urge him to reconsider it. I would urge this government to continue to provide appropriate funding for scientific research both directly to the project I have referred to but also through the education and the university sector. We are on the threshold of a new millennium. Very important work is being done by our Australian astronomers and scientists which deserves the support of us all.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking on the adjournment this evening, I want to detail some representations that have been made to me by students at James Cook University. Senators will be aware that for some weeks now there has been a great deal of concern about the various <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> options that the government may be considering on higher education in this country. While those concerns extend nationally and cover many issues of importance to all students, I have a particular feel for the issues as they affect students at regional campuses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my home city of Townsville there is one of the northern&hyphen;most university campuses&mdash;I must not forget the Northern Territory, which has a more recent university. James Cook University has a very lengthy history as a regional university. It is very important to its regional population. It is not the only regional university in Queensland, of course. The whole concept of the future of some of these regional campuses is of great concern to all of us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The students came to see me last week and put some of their concerns in writing. They are particularly concerned that cuts in higher education could lead to: reduced numbers of subjects within courses; reduced numbers of courses; closure of certain departments and certain campuses&mdash;for example, some senators may not be aware that it is possible to study certain subjects in Cairns and Mackay even though the university itself in based in Townsville, and this is so for other campuses of regional universities elsewhere in Queensland; cuts to academic and general staff; reduction in library and computer services; and increased lecture sizes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a former lecturer myself, I well know the impact of larger size classes on both students and, indeed, on staff&mdash;it is not possible to have the same rapport with students and some students do learn better in a smaller class size. So these general statements are of great concern to the students. This submission has been presented by Terri MacDonald, the James Cook University union president. In her final comment she says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Education is too important a sector of society to be hacked off at random to fill a deficit. If the quality of our education is poor, then so is our ability to practice in the post&hyphen;academic world. It is imperative that the values of the education sector are preserved as an incentive to the improvement of Australia's workforce market.</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise that these proposed budget cuts are only hypothetical at this stage but it has been enough to send a significant message of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2166"> disquiet through tertiary education around the country, and nowhere more than in the regional campuses. Terri MacDonald also says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These budget cuts do not effect only the students currently at university, but students wishing to attend university and the community at large as well. Students will not stand for this kind of treatment; we cannot afford to.</PARA>
<PARA>In the submission, the student union president does remind us of what the coalition's higher education policy is&mdash;or was. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Universities in regional areas are important participants in the economic development of their regions.</PARA>
<PARA>There may not be many things in coalition policies that I agree with, but I certainly agree with that statement. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coalition recognises that for historic reasons regional universities are poorly resourced, particularly in the area of research infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, I would agree that it is always harder, notwithstanding the efforts of government to decentralise and reach out into regional areas of Australia. For historic reasons it is true that it is more difficult to get services of all kinds into regional areas. You have different needs and different size communities. It is more of a challenge for governments and their relevant bureaucracies to provide the appropriate services in regional areas. The coalition higher education policy statement continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition also recognises that rural and regionally based students have been historically disadvantaged in Australia's higher education sector. The role of the regional universities in improving access for such students is vitally important.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition will seek to build and strengthen regional universities in recognition of the fact that they are important in providing rural students greater access to higher education.</PARA>
<PARA>That entire policy statement of the coalition is commendable. You will not often hear Margaret Reynolds commending the coalition's policies, but certainly there is nothing in that policy statement that I could disagree with. That is why students and many people in regional communities are very disturbed about the prospect, and what the future holds for regional universities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, the students at James Cook demand the coalition fulfils its promises and honours its commitment to small and regional universities. If the coalition is serious about <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> its commitment to universities like James Cook, the upcoming federal cuts should not apply to James Cook or any other small and regional university.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know of some of the comments that have been made by certain vice&hyphen;chancellors&mdash;I know it is only natural for vice&hyphen;chancellors to protect their own; that is a fact of life&mdash;but I would certainly make a plea to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) and members of the expenditure review committee that whatever decisions are being made in relation to higher education, there is a very strong case to exempt regional universities from any of the more draconian elements of funding cutbacks because those small campuses simply have not got the capacity to absorb cutbacks. I would not like to see cutbacks in any university; but I do think a special case has to be made for regional universities.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<STATE> (South Australia)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(7.27 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should begin my remarks tonight by saying that I concur with the statements made by Senator Reynolds. The Australian Democrats have expressed in this place on many occasions our concerns about the proposed funding cuts to higher education and, specifically, regional campuses. We know full well that those regional campuses will be hardest hit by any cuts to the higher education budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tonight I wish to talk about a regional campus, the University of South Australia's Salisbury campus. I think I express the concern and anger of many of my colleagues when I talk about the closing of the Salisbury campus. I know that the closure of this campus which was supposed to have been phased over a period of four years, starting next year through to the year 2000, has been speeded up in anticipation of funding cuts in this budget to the higher education sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know the local community and the staff and students share my anger because the decision to close the campus failed to take into account the best interests of the people in that area. I should note that people in the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2167"> Salisbury, Elizabeth and nearby Barossa Valley areas are among the most disadvantaged people in the South Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Salisbury campus is located in the northern suburbs of Adelaide. It is a region that has the most highly condensed urban population of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people outside Redfern&mdash;a little known fact. It also has a low socio&hyphen;economic make&hyphen;up. It is one of the lowest socio&hyphen;economic regions of the city, with a correspondingly low participation rate in higher education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> This campus of the University of South Australia was chosen to host the Jobs for Young Australians Conference last year because there was the hope in the Salisbury region that the campus could offer people from traditionally disadvantaged backgrounds the opportunity of an education, a job and a future. For almost 30 years, the courses at Salisbury have reflected this hope. The former teachers college has expanded over the years to cater for many other caring and service professions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people who chose to study at the Salisbury campus planned to be primary and secondary teachers, nurses, community workers, recreational planners and park rangers. They chose to study so that they could give back and contribute to their community. The university was meant to serve the community. The fact that it has now been closed down flies in the face of all equity and social justice principles. It also flies in the face of the mission statement of that campus and university.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite previous assurances by the university that many, if not all, the courses offered at the Salisbury campus would be transferred to the Levels campus, which is a city based campus, I find it appalling that only one school&mdash;the School of Environment and Recreation Management&mdash;will be left in that northern region. The very courses that contribute to the community, such as nursing, community work and teaching, will not be available at the inner northern Levels campus. These courses will be out of the reach of most students, as they will be located at campuses <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in the Magill and Underdale areas. These students will now be faced with many hours travel per  day by public transport. They will have to cope with a lack of appropriate facilities, such as the excellent child-care service that is currently located at the Salisbury campus. They will also lack an access point to higher education in their region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many students will be forced to drop out. Many more will find that their studies will suffer under the duress of having to travel longer distances or dealing with the extra burden of dislocation and a lack of support services that we know are vital to academic achievement. It is a betrayal of the university's mission statement and it is a betrayal of those people in the Adelaide northern suburbs region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Salisbury campus has successfully broadened access to education for those people from the northern suburbs. It is not simply a case of providing a campus at the back door for these students. It is a matter of these students being able to attend a campus where they are not marginalised because they are the first person in their family to access higher education. A Salisbury campus initiative, the pathfinder program, addressed this alienation with quite an innovative program which paid and encouraged students to study at that university. It encouraged them not only to study but also to go back and tutor many of their peers or people who were coming up behind them in that region. So it really provided role models for participation in higher education. It provided secondary school students with hope.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But Salisbury campus is now being closed. Those good intentions were not backed up with forethought or funding. As we all know, the higher education system suffered a 13 per cent cut in real terms over the period of the Labor government. It now looks like it is set to suffer more funding cuts under this coalition government. The intention of the former government was to give people, like those in Adelaide's northern suburbs, educational opportunities. Unfortunately, this was not evaluated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2168"> Recent reports have noted that participation by students from lower socioeconomic back grounds in higher education has not markedly improved in this country. This issue should be addressed as a matter of urgency. With the closure of campuses like the Salisbury campus, we will see this problem exacerbated and certainly not alleviated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been noted that the campus's catchment area covers the Barossa Valley region&mdash;this is quite ironic&mdash;where the former minister for education, Mr John Dawkins, who presided over the unified national system reforms, lives with his young family. I imagine the former minister hopes that his child will be able to reap the benefits of a mass higher education system. Unfortunately, Mr Dawkins's child, like many children from the northern region, will not be able to afford themselves of the course options at a campus in the northern region. It is a sad day for the people of the northern Adelaide suburbs. It is a sad day for those who care about academic excellence and the future of the so-called clever country. Without social justice and a fair go for all, we will never achieve excellence in higher education.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Industrial Relations has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2170">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) All APS departments, agencies and government business enterprises which are covered by the premium scheme operating under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation (SRC) Act 1988 are required to provide the SRC Commission with estimates of full&hyphen;time equivalent staff numbers and an overall salary estimate for the following financial year by 30 April each year. Government business enterprises which are self&hyphen;insurers under the SRC Act do not pay a premium and therefore are not subject to this requirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The estimates for 1996&hyphen;97 have been received by the SRC Commission. They are overall figures, based on agency estimates at the time the information was provided, i.e. April 1996. The estimates do not represent final figures for agencies' salaries and staff for 1996&hyphen;97. It is normal practice for Comcare (on behalf of the Commission) to seek updates of the salary and staffing estimates later in the year to reflect any changes that have occurred since the initial estimates were provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The preliminary estimates would not give an accurate picture of this for the purposes of the honourable member's question.</PARA></ANSWER></ANSWER.TO.QON></ANSWERS.TO.QUESTIONS></HANSARD>
