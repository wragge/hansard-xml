<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I raised a concern that we had not received the protests and asked whether what the Democrats were in fact doing was using the Internet to improperly collect issue based mailing lists. Having raised that question in the Senate, I took the opportunity of raising the matter with Senator Kernot later that night, because I think privacy principles and the use of the Internet are a genuine matter of concern to everybody. She indicated to me, not in these precise words, that this was not a matter that she had direct knowledge of, but that she would investigate the matter. And she did, promptly.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill contains several important measures announced in the 1996 Budget for the social security portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, in most cases, single people who share accommodation face lower costs through economies of scale, compared with the costs of living alone. The Government has decided to set a new maximum rate of rent assistance for single people who share accommodation from 1 July 1997. The new maximum rate for single sharers will be two&hyphen;thirds of the maximum rate for singles living independently.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, a number of groups will be exempt from the new rate. These groups comprise the following:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">single people with dependent children;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">boarders and lodgers;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">nursing home residents; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">people who live alone in caravans, mobile homes or vessels.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In certain situations, people who live only with their non&hyphen;dependent children will also be excluded.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, the second measure contained in the bill deals with the treatment of assets held in superannuation and rollover funds. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4210"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before March 1993, compulsorily preserved superannuation and rollover assets were exempt from the social security income and assets tests until age pension age. From March 1993, all superannuation benefits held in superannuation or rollover funds have been exempted from these tests until age pension age. This initiative involved estimated additional outlays of $4.1m in 1992&hyphen;93, increasing to $17.1m in 1995&hyphen;96.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given that superannuation savings are generally not subject to compulsory preservation after a person reaches the age of 55 and retires, people in these circumstances (including people who may not wish to retire but who have poor prospects of returning to work) can access their superannuation savings if they choose to do so. Consistent with the treatment of other savings, the Government considers that a person's superannuation savings should be taken into account in working out how much income support can be paid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, from 20 September 1997, the assets test exemption of assets held in superannuation and rollover funds by social security pensioners and allowees under age pension age will be removed for people aged between 55 and age pension age after 39 weeks on income support since turning 55. For income test purposes, affected customers' superannuation and rollover assets will be added to their other financial assets and assessed under extended deeming rules.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The anticipated savings from this measure are much greater than the estimated costs of the 1993 initiative. One reason why the latter estimated costs are significantly smaller is because they reflected only the additional costs of exempting non&hyphen;compulsorily preserved superannuation and rollover assets from the social security assets and income tests until age pension age. However, a significant reason for the difference is because of the extent to which customers who are effectively retired, invested in superannuation and rollover funds as a means of avoiding the operation of the assets and income tests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Neither the assets nor income test treatment of annuities and pensions, including allocated annuities and pensions, will change. These products will continue to be assessed under existing rules. This situation is, however, presently under review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, the Government is committed to ensuring that social security customers receive their rightful entitlement. At the same time, the Government considers that the Australian taxpayer has a right to expect that the Government will do all it can to minimise the scope for overpayments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Overpayments often arise during holiday periods such as Easter when social security allowance payments are programmed in advance to be paid automatically on predetermined days that are earlier <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> than usual if the customer's normal payday falls on a holiday. This can result in overpayments for the holiday period, some of which are not recoverable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To that end, the third measure contained in the bill provides for a modified application form for certain social security and youth training allowances to be submitted before payment. The modified form will require a declaration of any changes anticipated for the remainder of the payment period. If any overpayments arise for the payment period, they will be recoverable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of this bill be adjourned until the first day of sitting in 1997, in accordance with the order agreed to on 29 November 1994.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>The constitutional framework within which a nation goes forward into the future is crucial to its welfare. Australia's constitutional development is always in process, perhaps in most dramatic form through the decisions of the High Court. It is essential that the constitutional development of the nation is anticipated by the various parliaments around Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the developments that has been going on for some time is the growth of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> national schemes of legislation. It is a process that will become more and more pronounced as time goes by. National schemes of legislation are schemes like the Corporations Law which guides the way our companies and securities are controlled throughout Australia. Legislation with respect to these schemes is passed in the various states and territories and at the Commonwealth level. Such legislation guides the way we go about our corporate business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another uniform scheme is the censorship scheme which controls the censorship of various material in Australia. Another scheme is the consumer credit code. That is an interesting scheme in the sense that the Commonwealth is not part of it but the states and territories are. This is an illustration of the growth of common schemes throughout this nation. They can only become common legislative schemes when they are agreed to by the governments of various states and territories or the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ministers or heads of state come together at SCAG, the Standing Committee of Attorneys&hyphen;General, or COAG, the Council of Australian Governments, and agree upon a common legislative scheme that is for the good of Australia. That is a good process. We do not cavil with that. The effect is that once ministers gather around and come to an agreement on a common piece of legislation it is then a problem whether the parliament can have a sufficient say in the standard and status of that legislation and the way that legislation has been brought forward. The particular concern that the scrutiny committees have is that there might be in that legislation, innocently of course, provisions which take away from human rights and human liberties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no effective way for the various parliaments around Australia to look at the common legislation which has been agreed to by the ministers. The ministers do not want what has been agreed to unravelled. If it is unravelled months and perhaps years of work will be lost. They want the legislation to stay as it is. They are concerned that parliament would undo the bill before it becomes an act. The various scrutiny committees around <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4212"> Australia have attempted to develop a scheme whereby members of parliament can have an effective say in the making of this common legislation or, once it is made, to have an effective say in how it goes through parliament in the same way they would if legislation discrete to their individual parliaments was processed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have before us today a discussion paper. It is hoped that all parliamentarians will read it. It is hoped that after they read it they will make suggestions to the committee about how this problem may be solved&mdash;that is, the problem of ensuring parliamentarians have an effective say in the making of  national legislative schemes in a way that, in the opinion of ministers, does not violate the essence of the agreement that they have reached. It is an important matter. As a committee we hope that some productive ideas are advanced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to mention the people who have had something to do with the production of this important report at some time. This report will be seen Australia wide. These people have done outstanding work. I will start by noting and praising the work done by the secretary of the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, Mr Peter Crawford. It is good to see him in the chamber. He was assisted and guided by Professor Jim Davis from the Australian National University and Mrs Margaret Lindeman who works for the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I present this report jointly with Senator O'Chee. He would no doubt want to mention the people who helped him. The secretary of Senator O'Chee's committee, David Creed, Professor Douglas Whalan from the Australian National University and Janice Paull from the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances have all done great work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Others who have been involved with this report are Ms Louisa Pink from the Queensland Scrutiny of Legislation Committee and her assistant Lisa Shuttleworth, Tom Duncan from the Scrutiny of Bills and Subordinate Legislation Committee in the ACT&mdash;Madam President, you would be pleased to hear him <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mentioned because he comes from the place that you represent so well&mdash;Mr Greg Hogg from the Regulations Review Committee of New South Wales and Ms Helen Mason and Ms Tanya Coleman from the Scrutiny of Acts and Regulations Committee of Victoria, my home state. Both Ms Mason and Ms Coleman have done outstanding work in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to mention Mr David Pegram from the Legislative Review Committee in South Australia, Ms Wendy Peddle from the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Subordinate Legislation in Tasmania, Mr Stuart Kay and Ms Jan Paniperis from the Joint Standing Committee on Delegated Legislation in Western Australia, Ms Melina Newnan and Mr Keith Kendrick from the Standing Committee on Uniform Legislation and Intergovernmental Agreements in Western Australia, and Ms Helen Allmich from the Subordinate Legislation and Tabled Papers Committee from the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It can be seen that these people, from all round Australia, have done quite magnificent work in getting this report together. I think they have made a great contribution to the constitutional development of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also mention Senator Colston and Senator Troeth, who have been chairs of my committee and who have done work in this area. The following people are no longer there but they ought be remembered: Mr Victor Perton&mdash;an outstanding figure in this area&mdash;in Victoria; Mr Jon Sullivan in Queensland; Mr Adrian Cruickshank in New South Wales; and Mr Tony Benneworth in Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also mention the present chairs of these committees: Rosemary Follett, from your territory, Madam President; Mr Doug Shedden from New South Wales; Mr Rick Setter from the Northern Territory; Mr Tony Elliott from Queensland; Mr Robert Lawson from South Australia; Mr John Loone from Tasmania; Mr Peter Ryan from Victoria; Mr Bruce Donaldson from Western Australia; and, of course, Mr Phillip Pendal from Western Australia, who has been a great driving force behind this scheme.

<STATE> (Queensland)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(9.55 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday I talked about the particular impact that the deregulation of the labour market would have on women and that proposed deregulation, as indicated in the bill, would disproportionately affect women. I was backed up in my comments by a book that had been prepared which looked specifically at this issue. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because women have generally relied more heavily on legislation to protect them from the adverse effects of the market, labour market regulations have been necessary to remedy market failures and distortions which are likely to affect women more than men.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Removal of such regulations, especially those dealing with labour market discrimination, could leave women exposed to important disadvantages. They would be subject to unequal hiring and promotion standards, unequal opportunities for training and retraining, unequal opportunity for occupational mobility, unequal pay for equal work and/or unequal likelihood of being retrenched.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The danger is that deregulation sanctions and encourages bad practices. The weakening of the protective framework and institutional safeguards may very well open the floodgates for more serious exploitation with no guarantee that standards will be reinstated by employers of their own accord even in the long term.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that quote is very relevant to this debate. I remind honourable senators that this comes against the background that I mentioned yesterday of John Bradford, a member of the coalition, calling for the abolition of the Affirmative Action Agency, not to mention the ministry for the status of women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that all the gains that have been made and the fact that you, Madam President, now preside over this chamber are very much a reflection of the change of attitudes in the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> community&mdash;a change of practice. But not all women have yet benefited from these changes of attitudes and changes of practices. We cannot assume that just because there have been so many changes&mdash;with women participating much more in the workplace, being involved in non&hyphen;traditional areas of the workplace&mdash;it is a trend that will continue unless there are protective mechanisms in place. Those protective mechanisms include the Affirmative Action Agency and, certainly, the Industrial Relations Commission maintaining its watching brief over award conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the time remaining, I would like to address a particularly good submission by the National Pay Equity Coalition to a Senate committee. Not only did it have an excellent submission&mdash;I will come to the executive summary in a moment&mdash;but I will later seek leave to incorporate or table its bibliography, because it contains 37 articles and reports, seven wage cases and five Australian Bureau of Statistics publications. It is a very useful reference.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Pay Equity Coalition's submission raises serious concerns about the likely impact of the proposed new industrial relations bill on women workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The book draws on a wealth of research&mdash;which is why I will seek leave to incorporate the bibliography&mdash;which shows that, the more deregulated the labour market, the more women are disadvantaged. In the last decade there has been a significant shift in the industrial relations system from national wage cases and conditions regulated by awards to one where more and more decisions affecting people's working lives are determined by their bargaining power at workplace level. The proposed system, the National Pay Equity Coalition argues, is not deregulation but reregulation, and reregulation in the interests of employers. It is cloaked in rhetoric about choice and freedom for women but under the proposed bill women will be less able to access their rights, less able to protect their existing entitlements and less able to improve their labour market position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The National Pay Equity Coalition, after it had participated in its presentation to the Senate committee and had had some consultations with minister Peter Reith, wrote again to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4214"> me and, I am sure, to other senators. It made the point that, notwithstanding some of the clarifications the minister had made, it still remained concerned about these issues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe that the legislation will widen the pay equity gap.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present the ratio of women's earnings to men's earnings, the hourly rate, stands at 83.3 per cent. In spite of this evidence of structural inequality in the work force, the draft legislation substantially reduces the pay equity provisions of the Industrial Relations Act of 1988 by restricting provisions to equal pay rather than equal remuneration. This means that the over-award rates and conditions are not subject to equal pay provisions. That has not been emphasised enough in debate.</PARA>
<PARA>I see that my colleague Senator Rosemary Crowley has just come into the chamber. I am sure she will be pursuing this issue because, although many honourable senators on this side of the chamber have raised it, it has not been an issue that the government has wanted to debate publicly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no evidence to suggest that a deregulated industrial relations system will contribute to improving the labour market position of women. To the contrary&mdash;both domestic and overseas research proves that a substantial loss of pay equity occurs with a movement to enterprise and individualised bargaining systems. On this point it is important to note that the highest pay equity ratio achieved by women in Australia, 84.6 per cent, was prior to the onset of enterprise bargaining.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The patterns of enterprise bargaining that have taken place reveal that a significant number of agreements exclude women and that women are more likely than men to be covered by agreements that provided for an increase in working hours. Despite this evidence, the legislation does not provide for scrutiny of the proposed Australian workplace agreements through the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to ensure that women are not disadvantaged in the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is substantial evidence to prove that women will be disadvantaged by the restriction on the ambit of awards. At present the minimum requirements for awards excluded a number of areas&mdash;I detailed them earlier in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> my speech&mdash;which have a key impact on working women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes proposed by the government will have a serious effect on all workers, but particularly on women workers. I reiterate them: weakening the power of the Industrial Relations Commission to set employment conditions and to vet workplace agreements, both of which changes seriously limit the commission's capacity to protect those most in need and particularly women; and reducing the coverage of awards to a bare minimum of conditions, which means that women will lose important protections relating to hours of work, including the operation of part-time work, meal and clothing provisions, sexual harassment and equal opportunity procedures and conditions above the standards such as paid maternity leave.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women, Senator Jocelyn Newman, has been outspoken in a number of areas of importance to women, and I commend her for that, but has not been vocal on this issue. I wonder to what extent she was consulted. Finally, removing the commission's powers to deal with discriminatory over-award payments, which remain a key component in women's battle to achieve equal pay in practice, will put the onus on individual workers to make complaints about discriminatory or otherwise unlawful agreements. That puts the worker in the position of having to prove that discrimination and prove that disadvantage.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the record, I am not listed to speak at this time. Senator Reynolds said that she felt sure that I would want to reiterate all that she said, and indeed I do. I thank her for her contribution to this debate. The Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 is, as the government has made clear, an absolutely pivotal part of its policies. That is why the Labor opposition is so strenuous in fighting it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4216">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This pivotal legislation makes clear the government's view about a whole lot of things&mdash;in particular, their view of how the world ought to be. They have introduced into this community a budget that is without any doubt a Thatcher&hyphen;Tory budget. The Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill is exactly in sync with that. It is legislation that is ideologically driven. It is a bill designed to reduce the power and the rights of workers. It fits absolutely with the changes in the budget that do away with many services and hard won gains for many people in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prime Minister Howard promised that he would have a country that will be comfortable and relaxed. Under this bill, most workers would certainly cease to be relaxed, and many of them would be much less comfortable, even in terms of `comfortable' meaning `reasonably paid'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other important thing about this piece of legislation is that it will not create one new job. It will do nothing to help the unemployed, and this government does not put a figure on the number of unemployed. It cannot do that because it has policies that have already seen an increase in the number of unemployed, such as direct cutbacks in the Public Service, but also policies that are quite clearly intent on seeing the unemployed figures rise&mdash;hence no commitment to any estimate of getting the numbers down. At least Senator Vanstone, the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, in a moment of forgetful honesty, said that if they do not get the figures down they will not be re&hyphen;elected. But even she baulked at putting a figure on it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government's Tory&hyphen;Thatcher budget has hung the unemployed out to dry. I know that when I once before made that comment in debate in this place Senator Newman was up on her feet protesting that that was not the truth. That just meant that it stung her. It stung her because it is true. The unemployed have been forgotten.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My colleague Senator Hogg assists me here by reiterating that that is absolutely the case. The unemployed are ignored and forgotten. This piece of so&hyphen;called primacy legislation, pivotal legislation, will do nothing to help the unemployed. It will not create one job.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation has a goal of cooperative workplace relations. That is the language, and yet what it will be doing is building on and designing secret agreements between employer and employee. You will not know what your workmate is  getting, and that is not good for cooperative workplace arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will do away with many of the things that the workers and the union movement have fought for for 100 years. It will remove equal pay provisions and the award protection for part&hyphen;time and casual workers, most of whom are women. Indeed, I am very pleased to follow my colleague Senator Reynolds because this legislation is very damaging to women workers in particular. When you put that with this government's policies of increasing the costs of child care, despite earnest promises that they would not, and if you put it with their policies to have a modest tax benefit for families where one spouse is at home&mdash;usually the woman&mdash;you see a package of policy, secret not overt, in which this government would like to see women out of the work force and back into the home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I noted over the weekend that there was an article by Geoffrey Blainey saying that the decade of the century was the decade of the 40s. Certainly, if you have to have a decade that encompasses the Second World War, it is not without significance. As I read it, one of the points that Professor Blainey wanted to make about the significance of the 1940s&mdash;and maybe the article did not do full justice to him&mdash;was that, despite all those men who returned to Australia, all those people out of the forces coming back to Australia, some hundreds of thousands, there was no loss of employment; they were just absorbed into the work force and `Wasn't that fantastic!'</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4217">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yes, indeed, Professor Blainey, but did you count what happened to the women? The reason that so many men went into the work force was because so many women came out of it, and I am surprised that a historian of Professor Blainey's standing did not actually make that point. How do you measure unemployment? How do you measure full employment if you are not talking about labour force participation and if you are not talking about the huge contribution of women to the work force in this country during the war&mdash;if you are not talking about large numbers of the jobs being taken by men after the women were removed back to the home? That is what is on the agenda again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sometimes we talk about Mr Howard taking us back to the 1960s. Personally, I think we should go back to the 1950s and, after reading that article by Professor Blainey, I believe that, no, it is right back to the 1940s. `A woman's place is in the home' is certainly the view of a large number of the government, particularly those in the Lyons Forum. And we were assisted in our thinking about what they have to say by the Queensland member, Mr Bradford, who has come out in the press over the weekend saying that we should abolish the Affirmative Action Agency and the Office of the Status of Women because women are too advantaged in this country and men are disadvantaged. There is another example of very conservative thinking hauling us back into the past, and here is this piece of legislation that is making its contribution to exactly that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government also boasts the importance of so many women being elected to parliament in the coalition ranks, and I am on the record as saying, `Well done.' I have been one of those people who congratulate women being successful in parliament, but I certainly make a clear distinction between a Labor woman and a Liberal woman and Labor policies and Liberal policies&mdash;</PARA>

I suppose it is problematic that she is now doing chair duty and, therefore, unable to respond at this time. It is not for that reason that I want to draw attention to Senator Patterson's comments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First of all, Senator Patterson talked about the problems of closed shops&mdash;that if you are not in a union you do not get a job. Well, Senator Patterson, I am sure that there are situations like that in Australia, but come with me to the small businesses and the big businesses around Australia that are closed shops to anyone who smells of a union. How dare you suggest that there is only fault in one direction. There are thousands of people who cannot get near employment if they have a union card. There are closed shops absolutely preventing and proscribing anybody from a union&mdash;even a worker who is a member of a union&mdash;from coming into that workplace let alone giving the opportunity for union representatives to visit those workers. I note that a lot of the gains&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank you for this assistance, Madam Acting Deputy President, who is, for the record, Senator Patterson. You <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are quite right. Every time it says `you' the record should note that it should be `Senator Patterson'&mdash;who proposed this quite curious argument that there are closed shops, that this is a bad thing and that the coalition's industrial relations legislation change, the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill, is somehow going to free up workplaces from being closed shops. If you can give us a guarantee that the closed shops that will not let a non-unionised person in will be equally matched by closed shops that will not let anybody who has a union card in, that might be a gain. But we know you do not mean that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next point that Senator Patterson made in her contribution was to use that very disappointing argument: nobody in the Labor Party has ever been in a small business; therefore, they cannot talk about it because they do not know what they are talking about. As a doctor, I have often thought that argument would mean that I could never talk about the pain of a broken leg, having not had one myself. It is a nonsense argument and Senator Patterson knows that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She went on to illustrate the point by saying that nobody on the Labor side should talk about small business because none of them is in them and they do not know what they are talking about. She then went on to talk at great length about the evils of unions, about which she knows nothing, of which she has never been a member and about which she has, in the past, made points about how she would not be a unionist. If Senator Patterson wants to argue that we cannot talk about small businesses because none of us has experienced them&mdash;and I would not test the facts of that statement&mdash;then strictly, according to her own logic, she cannot talk about unions because she has no knowledge of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Patterson can make her points about unions and, equally, the Labor Party can make its points about small business. What the Labor Party did with its previous legislation was to move towards enterprise agreements and freeing up the labour market, freeing up opportunities in the workplace and encouraging small business as well as large <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4219"> business. I note, for the record, that it was Senator Schacht, as minister responsible for small business, who proposed and introduced legislation dealing with unconscionable conduct. The coalition failed to address it, even though that would have been of great benefit to small business. It depends on the size of the small business&mdash;and, having looked at all your share dealings over the last day or so, it seems that many of you travel very closely with very large business indeed. That is a spurious argument of Senator Patterson and I sincerely hope she does not use it again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next person I want to take issue with is Senator Troeth who actually argued that what we were suggesting in debate was that women would be incapable of making or negotiating an agreement for themselves. That is about as stupid a remark as it is offensive from Senator Troeth. Women are very capable, in certain circumstances, of negotiating agreements. It was Senator Troeth and her colleagues on the other side who regularly got stuck into the Labor government, complaining that women would be disadvantaged in all sorts of situations if they had to, for example, return to the work force after some years out of the work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those opposite also seem to contradict themselves entirely if you consider the case of a 16-, 17- or 18-year-old young woman going for her first employment after leaving school. What is her capacity to satisfactorily and on her own negotiate an agreement when she no longer has the protection of an award? Where does she go? Does she ring up somebody and say, `I'm going off for my first job interview; I need to know the legislative requirements and the terms of the possible agreement that I can negotiate?' Most young people going for work are desperate for a job, will settle for what is offered to them and will certainly not be in a position to bargain on their own behalf. You know and have argued in this place, as I have, the difficulties facing women returning to the work force after years out of it. They are people who are not fully confident and not people who, with all the assurance, can go in and negotiate a fair agreement for themselves.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Reynolds has spelt out how bad this legislation is over a variety of areas, but in particular it is very tough on women. It removes the equal pay provisions and it will remove the award protection for part&hyphen;time and casual workers, most of whom are women. How can you argue that this legislation will advantage women?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Already, thousands of women in the community know that what you say is not what you mean. The legislation's attack on women and the increased cost of child care&mdash;to say nothing of any other changes&mdash;are two changes alone that send the message to women that they would be better off going home. That is what the coalition Howard government wants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Women in the community have said, `We have employment, we have job opportunities, we like our part&hyphen;time work, we like mixing work and family responsibilities, we like being professional women, we like being horse trainers, we like being jockeys, we like doing all of those things. We want the services of child care to support us and, no, we do not want legislation that weakens our hand, that removes our equal pay, that disadvantages us and loses us the benefits we have been trying to win over years and years of argument.' In particular, they do not want less money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">`No worker will be worse off,' Mr Howard promised. Mr Howard is delivering another broken promise. It is rhubarb, and everybody will know that, because not only will people have lost conditions and protections, they will not get so much money. Other speakers in this debate have spelt out particular examples. The Victorian nurses are one case in point. Quite clearly, they have less money and are worse off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to finish by saying that it has taken over 100 years of fighting to get this far, and to see that wiped out by this piece of legislation would be a tragedy. In my state of South Australia, in 1890, the first working women's union was formed. In 1891 the Liquor Trades Union was formed, as were a number of other unions. In my state in 1894 the women won the right to vote and stand for parliament.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4220">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Women's Christian Temperance Union and the Women's Suffrage Movement were both very political organisations, not the bunch of wowsers that they have been labelled since. They were arguing for equal pay, a fair day's pay for a fair day's work and safety in the workplace. They were asking for something more than sixpence for a shirt manufactured by piecework. They were arguing for better health conditions and educational opportunities for their children, the same sorts of things that 100 years on we have to argue for again&mdash;protection and rights for workers, protection and rights for women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In South Australia we are revisiting that fight a whole century on. If anyone is interested, go and look at the debates and understand that what I have said is exactly true&mdash;100 years ago women were arguing and fighting for wage justice, wage protection and decent employment. This legislation, if it passes, will make all those battles start again&mdash;wage justice for women, safety in the workplace, protection of awards&mdash;for all the conditions and terms that women have struggled to get.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill should be defeated because it breaches a rock&hyphen;solid guarantee by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) that nobody will be worse off. It should be defeated because it opens the door to cutting youth wages and introducing a $3 per hour youth wage. It should be defeated because it removes the fairness that is entrenched in the existing industrial relations system. It should be defeated because it does not recognise the legitimacy and desirability of employees organising and bargaining collectively.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should be defeated because it proceeds from a fundamentally flawed assumption that the parties to the employment relationship have equal bargaining power. It should be defeated because it severely restricts the central role of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission in the industrial relations system. It should also be defeated because it undermines the award system as the dynamic framework for the protection and advancement of wages and conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should be defeated because it removes workplace and enterprise bargaining from the protection of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Further, it should be defeated because it will aggravate problems of inequality for women, young people and those most vulnerable in the labour market. It should be defeated because it fails to provide a core framework for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should be defeated because it emphasises the punishment of industrial action rather than its resolution. And it should be defeated because it fails to ensure that Australia's labour standards meet those of our international obligations. For those reasons, this bill should be defeated. It should not be withdrawn and rewritten so much as simply withdrawn.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The outcry against this legislation is in itself enough to condemn it. Legislation that promises to promote industrial harmony but which attracts such division in society obviously cannot succeed in its goal. Therefore, on its immediate face it is plainly legislation which is provocative, divisive, bringing a lack of harmony and cooperation, and reintroducing confrontation into the Australian workplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is an example of what is happening now. If this bill were to pass into law, that is what would happen in practice. That is not in Australia's interest. There has to be a way of bringing the parties back together and having a more common view, a greater consensus about the way forward in industrial relations, than this legislation provides.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of my greatest problems with this bill is the language used to sell it and the language used to explain it. That language is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4221"> distorted. That language does not corroborate the true meaning of English. It is used to allay worry. It is used to gull the unwary. It is used to confuse the ignorant. And it is used to reassure the apathetic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The language used to sell this bill is almost as evil as some of the clauses in this legislation. That is the immediate problem that the electors of Australia have in trying to work out the truth here. If they believe the language used to flog this legislation in the community, they will be absolutely misguided as to what this legislation does.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just think there is a real case for some truth in advertising or truth in politics about what really is at play rather than what people claim to be at play. This bill is predicated on a number of principles. They are that it will uphold the rights of individuals, that it will encourage greater productivity, that it will streamline dispute settlement and that it will be in the national good. Those who wrought this legislation and explain it use those principles and invoke the majesty of those ideals as their defence. The trouble is it does not deliver on any of them and while this bill is called reform one could hardly call something reform when it makes the situation worse. While it is continually bruited abroad as reform, people think it may have elements of good.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish I could find some elements of good so I could balance my remarks from a considered point of view and say, `On one hand there are all these bad things but there are some elements of good.' That would be a reasonable position to take. I cannot find those elements of good in this legislation to try to find a balanced position. I am therefore put in a position of having no alternative but to reject the legislation. The truth of this legislation does not fit the facts and so those who have promoted it have decided that the facts are expendable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me go to the details so I do not just say that as rhetoric. It is said that this bill will introduce greater wage flexibility. In fact, that is true. Greater wage flexibility will be introduced by this bill, but it will be flexibility for wages to fall, not rise. There might be occasions on which some wages for workers in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> very strong bargaining positions, in key positions of the production process, are able to use their bargaining power to lift wages. But for the vast majority of Australians, this bill means that the flexibility that is bruited abroad and claimed as a key feature of this bill is the flexibility for wage cuts, not wage increases or greater recognition of productivity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is said that this bill will introduce greater choice for individuals and, therefore, on the basis of freedom of choice this bill should pass. That choice takes the form that you can choose an award or a contract or an individual contract. The fact is that those words are meaningless and superficial. They are used because they have an appeal and seemingly embody a good ideal. But the truth is that you cannot consider choice without considering the bargaining strengths of the participants in the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week we saw a key example of what bargaining strength looks like. We saw an advertisement for 40 apprentices in Newcastle&mdash;and 1,900 people applied for those jobs. For the individual choice argument to hold, any one of those 1,900 people who are trying to obtain employment as an apprentice has to be assumed to have equal bargaining power with the employer who will engage them. They can then stand up for their rights and demand higher wages if they believe their productivity and contribution to the workplace justify it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can anyone seriously comprehend that any of those young people seeking the job of an apprentice&mdash;the 1,900 of them&mdash;has an equal bargaining position with their employer in those circumstances? That is an extraordinary proposition yet we are told that this is a freedom of choice. The assumption is, therefore, that all of those 1,900 young people are free to make a choice. In reality the free choice they are entitled to make in these circumstances&mdash;the only one they have open to them&mdash;is a choice of accepting what is offered or accepting unemployment; and that is no choice at all. When we hear those words `greater freedom of choice' one has to bear that in mind.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4222">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also know that not all employers are going to be unscrupulous. There are many employers in this country who are committed to achieving a good outcome for their workers. The problem for those employers is that they are undermined by this bill too, because if they are in competition with employers who are unscrupulous and who will drive down wages and exploit workers, and produce a product or a service at the end of the day because of that exploitation, which is cheaper than the employers who want to do the right thing by their work force, the good employers go out of business and the bad employers succeed. They succeed because they have exploited their workers and cut their wages. They have reduced their costs and made a bigger profit; and they have driven their competition off the block. When one talks about flexibility and greater choice one has to bear that in mind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are told that this bill will ensure that third parties do not interfere in the bargaining process. The third party, unspoken but malevolently referred to here, is of course a union. A union exists to protect and represent the interests of its members and not to do it individually so much as as a collective. If that body is unable to speak in this bargaining process, the bargaining power of which I spoke a moment ago is unequal. If all of those 1,900 apprentices who applied for the 40 positions in Newcastle last week were represented by a common bargaining agent, namely their union, and it could negotiate a reasonable wage all of them would be competing equally for those 40 positions, knowing that the wages and working conditions were not a factor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you remove that union from the equation, those people are competing on their merit as potential employees as well as bargaining away their rights and reducing their cost. That is a key case of exploitation. So when we hear this argument about third parties not interfering, that means we are shifting the bargaining strengths away from the two parties being in balance to one in which one party is predominant and the other is open to exploitation. Workers in those situations have limited choices.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is said of this legislation that it will allow unions to compete for members&mdash;but compete with whom? It will mean competing with their employers as this legislation is set out because if it is true&mdash;as it is&mdash;that the clarion cry of unions is `Unity is strength; together we can bargain' then the clarion cry for unscrupulous employers is `Divide and conquer.' That means that the so&hyphen;called competition for members, which sounds on the face of it to be a reasonable thing to do, means that you undermine the strength of unions by dividing and conquering them, and by separating out the members individually and dealing with them away from the collective and away from their common good. Thus, you again succeed in the goal of reducing wages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is said of this bill that Australia will become a more productive nation and will focus on productivity, and that that will be a good thing. It is a good thing to focus on productivity. Historically, in labour productivity and capital productivity, this nation enjoyed record rates of productivity growth under the previous government. By international comparisons within its peer group economies of the OECD, Australia's productivity growth has been growing much faster than that of many other countries. So what is the problem? The problem is that this is claimed to be an increase in productivity by making people work harder&mdash;not by making people work smarter, not by being better trained and skilled and thus better able to work the complex and sophisticated plant and equipment to deliver high quality services, but, rather, by working faster and harder as in the concept of the old days of the industrial revolution. That is stupid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The psychology of this bill is, in fact, against greater productivity. To achieve greater productivity these days, it does not matter whether individuals work harder. That is determined by the speed of the production line. It means that if we are going to work smarter as a country, manufacture high quality, sophisticated consumer products and deliver high quality, sophisticated services, the emphasis must be on training in the use of the plant and equipment to produce more <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4223"> per head through sophisticated technology than individuals can possibly achieve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is said of this bill that the Industrial Relations Commission continues. It does in name only, not in fact. The Industrial Relations Commission that was given birth in Australia over 100 years ago by the troubles of the 1890s is an industrial relations commission that we will not recognise in future if this legislation proceeds. That Industrial Relations Commission was built on three basic precepts which have endured and stood the test of time. Its determinations are based on the principles of justice, equity and the substantial merits of the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The argument here is that it does not matter how poor or lacking in strength you are; if there is a process of arbitration, the merit of your case and your claim can be determined. The rich and powerful are equal to one opportunity to put their case on merit and the poor and weak are equal to one opportunity to put their case on merit; and an experienced arbitrator, used to the practical way of life, decides. Essentially, that is the theory of arbitration as we know it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This system and the so&hyphen;called system that will continue arbitration will remove the powers of that umpire, take away their whistle, restrict them to a narrow area of law and prevent them from determining issues that affect the working lives of men and women and employers and companies in this country across the board. That will mean a limitation of power. The Industrial Relations Commission as we know it will not continue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is said of this bill that no worker will be worse off. We know that young workers will be worse off. We know that women workers will be worse off. We know that workers in positions of weak bargaining power will be worse off. Before this election, the Prime Minister said that no worker would be worse off. That was obviously not a core promise; it has been devalued. We already know that workers will be worse off. To see that workers are genuinely worse off, one only has to look at the comparisons of the state jurisdictions in Australia where look&hyphen;alike legislation has been passed and is now applied</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have done a quick survey of some of the more outrageous claims of what this legislation is about. When one applies the searchlight of practical reality, they are revealed as empty, hollow, misleading and argumentative in the sense that they are trying to con people and not explain to people what the legislation is about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said that in the 1890s Australia went through an upheaval in its industrial relations system. It did. The outcry that rang across the nation then was `There must be a better way. We can't be continually racked with the major disputes that go on endlessly with no possibility of resolution and with the bitterness of their aftermath that endures endlessly. We can't do that.' Australia then created the system of arbitration. That has evolved over time. It is predictable, understandable and is what Australians know as the way to industrial justice. That is what we are used to. It is a system that works. The old cry `If it ain't broke don't fix it' does not apply. This system ain't broke and it does not need to be thrown out and recast through this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This system always needs improvement; it always needs to be upgraded according to the circumstances. Over time the arbitration system has been, and during the last period of the Labor government it was. It was broadened and deepened and made more flexible to meet the needs of Australia's economy moving into the global economy and reduced levels of protection in this country. It was done in a way in which it protected the rights of Australians but with a safety net protection that ensured that no&hyphen;one could be exploited, while the opportunity and encouragement was there for workers to choose collective bargaining as a way of collaborating with their employers to increase the productivity of their company and, by increasing their productivity, get a greater income for that company on the basis that shareholders and management, workers and employees would share equally and fairly in the increased productivity that those that provide the investment, those that provide the managerial skills and those that provide the practical workplace skills to make a product or deliver a service participated in so the shares would be equal, no&hyphen;one would <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4224"> be exploited and there could be a basis for common cooperation. That was the basis on which we amended legislation. It was optional and it was free. No force or coercion was applied. There was opportunity and inducement. If people did not want to take it then there was a managerial task to find a way in which they could.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation introduces force and coercion. It introduces a system to force people out of awards. One only has to look at the statistics of some of the look&hyphen;alike states like Victoria and Western Australia to see how that has happened. We have had a system that has served this nation well, has evolved over time, has been modified to the circumstances, has worked well, was predictable and understood, was known about and was not broken. That will all be cast out and a new system, which has created major problems elsewhere in Australia, will be introduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not an academic argument, though. There is an empirical test here. There is basic evidence now as to the differences between the system that Labor had and the system that this coalition government proposes to introduce. It is none other than a report by the Department of Industrial Relations into enterprise bargaining in Australia, the annual report in 1995, which is a voluminous document, too complex to go into now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Essentially, it is able to compare how many workers went into enterprise or workplace bargains at the federal level under the industrial regulation of the former government and how many and what type of bargains they went into at the state level under the Kennett government and the Court government, how those bargains operated, what the satisfaction level was and what the productivity outcomes were.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The unequivocal finding is that the system that we had worked; that 60 per cent of workplaces with 10 or more employees under the federal system went into those bargains, compared with hardly any, unless they were forced, at the state level; that 75 per cent of all those employees that went into those bargains expressed a high level of satisfaction; and that, from October 1991 to April 1996, 8,000 federal agreements were ratified. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> So the system is working. The arguments that we need to make a revolutionary change are not justified and the proposals here therefore should be scotched. I reject the legislation. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It occurred to me, when I was considering comments that had been made by various senators about workplace agreements during this debate on the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill, and the reality of those documents in the real world in terms of, for example, the points that Senator Cook has just been making in respect of young people who will not have access to the significant resources that are provided by trade unions and so on, that the reality of what will actually happen in respect of employees' real knowledge of those agreements at that level of the community could not be exemplified any better than by the current debate that we are engaged upon, which has so far claimed the scalps of two government frontbenchers. Were the rules to apply fairly, as of this day, as of this moment, it would certainly equally claim the scalps of the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, Mr Moore, and of the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Tim Fischer, without going any further through the cabinet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In real terms&mdash;and I reflected on this when I went back through the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cabinet Handbook</EMPHASIS> again this morning&mdash;the code of conduct of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) for his ministers is their workplace enterprise agreement. Those are precisely the conditions under which they are employed, the rules with which they will have to comply. It is clear from this current debate that few of them have even bothered to read it and those few who did bother to read it have clearly not understood it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Or ignored it. In terms of that ministerial enterprise agreement, if this country's arguably leading citizens, that is, the federal cabinet, have so much trouble understanding their enterprise agreement that it has already cost two of them their jobs in consecutive 24&hyphen;hour periods and has placed a whole heap of others in real <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4225"> jeopardy, what hope in real terms have people in the community got, particularly those younger people who will be very much the victims of this new system? If the federal cabinet cannot get their enterprise agreement right, what chance has anyone else got of doing so? They will be vulnerable indeed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Cook and others have said, the real core of this entire operation, and we all know it, is to strike down the award system in Australia, to remove that safety net which underpins employer&hyphen;employee relationships in Australia, and to substitute a free&hyphen;for&hyphen;all. It is not a new argument. It is as old as politics itself. In fact, the arguments of protection&mdash;tariffs, if you like&mdash;or marketplace rules go back hundreds of years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam Acting Deputy President, as you would know, one of the fundamental debates, particularly in places like Great Britain, for hundreds of years was that the market should set the rules for labour. This is a very ancient conservative argument. There is nothing new about it. The repercussions, of course, of letting the marketplace rule in respect of the conditions and pay of employees who did not enjoy the same negotiating strength as the people who sit on the other side of the table from them has been well known in the past and no doubt will be revisited in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been very largely a product of the situation in New Zealand and, without question, in terms of the debate that led up to their election, was instrumental in bringing about the result that we have now had; that is, that this prosperity which New Zealand has enjoyed in terms of its overall economic statistics has not been enjoyed by the majority of the population in New Zealand, who have in fact been used as the pawns to produce some of that wealth, none of which they are the beneficiaries of. In fact, as the leader of the Labour Party and the potential new Prime Minister of that country has observed in the past few days, all of that national prosperity is not much good at the end of the day when people are still needing assistance to feed their families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been some interesting contributions to this debate and a great deal of the traditional anti&hyphen;union rhetoric. I thought the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> point was very well made by my colleagues Senator Reynolds and Senator Crowley, who spoke a short time ago, and who talked about these one&hyphen;way rules that apply in the debate on industrial relations. We on this side of the house are continually being accused of not being in business and never having had experience in small business. I am not quite sure what a doctor's surgery is if it is not a small business, but these epithets are constantly thrown across the chamber in an attempt to make a platform for saying we should therefore not discuss these issues. It does not stop the same people, who constantly give you the impression they would not sit in the same room as a union official and certainly would never join one, going forth at great length about the sins and omissions of unions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had the opportunity of being a workplace union delegate when I worked for the CSIRO. Even though it is a long time ago, there is one thing that I can still remember from those days in terms of the real position in the world in respect of conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People go on at great length about the declining membership of unions in Australia. That is a fact of life, and it is a fact of life that the unions have to grapple with. I certainly know from first-hand experience as a workplace union delegate one of the reasons for that declining membership, but I am pleased to say that it did not happen in the small workplace that I was involved in. Nevertheless, one of my jobs was to discuss with new employees the work that the union did on their behalf, to discuss the dues that would need to be paid&mdash;whether they wanted them deducted from their salary, et cetera&mdash;and, indeed, to discuss whether they wanted to join the union at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a reaction which I often got during those discussions. After I had explained that there was an annual round of discussions between the union that represented us in terms of our wages and conditions, after I had discussed the fact that the union was always available as a resource when employees needed it and after I had particularly discussed the wages, conditions and service that we negotiated, one question that I would be asked was, `If I don't join the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4226"> union and if I don't pay those dues, will I still get the wages and the conditions?' In respect of my workplace, the answer to that was, `Yes, you will&mdash;if you want to ride on the backs of the rest of us who actually provide our union dues out of our salaries in order to help you secure the wages and conditions that you get.' I am pleased to say that in all cases&mdash;certainly while I was there&mdash;that was an argument that won the day, and there was a 100 per cent union membership in that workplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no question that there are a lot of workers who are quite happy to accept the benefits&mdash;and they are significant&mdash;that the resources of an organised and professional union can bring to a workplace without having to endure the obligation of paying the dues. That is certainly one of the reasons for the decline in union membership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other speakers have canvassed a whole range of issues to do with this debate which I will not go over again. I want to highlight one potential negative result for workers if this legislation is carried through this house. This legislation will have an extremely detrimental effect on workers in the part of the world where I come from and, Madam Acting Deputy President Reynolds&mdash;if I may be forgiven for addressing the chair directly&mdash;where you come from, that is, in the more remote and regional locations of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">None of the conditions that workers have had unions fight for and achieve over many years and that are provided for them in northern Australia will be protected if this legislation passes through the Senate in the way it is currently drafted. The conditions will be all up for grabs and will be all, potentially, dumped. There is no question at all, considering the track record of the negotiations that I am very familiar with in northern Australia, that the first reaction of many employers will be to dump the conditions and the enterprise agreements in this brave new world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> What we are talking about are things like the district allowance, accommodation assistance and airconditioning subsidies that are provided in remote locations in northern Australia, where climatic conditions, I con fess, are very stressful at certain times of the year. We are also talking about the annual recreation leave air fares that are provided as part of awards and the additional recreation leave, which we have had in the Northern Territory for as long as I can remember. All of those additional benefits to workers will be up for grabs. Also, there are the fares out of isolated localities for specified purposes&mdash;that is for medical, dental and specialist treatment or on compassionate grounds&mdash;which are also commonplace. None of those will be protected if this legislation passes through the Senate as it is currently drafted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have received just in the last week letters from territorians who have been in the position of having to utilise these additional benefits for medical treatment. I am actually talking about real people&mdash;not the Wright family; the manufactured, fictional family of Senator Vanstone. I am actually talking about real people with real experiences who have only recently been alerted to what might happen. I might add that they have been alerted by the activities of the Community and Public Sector Union in the Northern Territory, by the submissions that were given to the Senate committee which sat in Darwin and by the publicity that ensued.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I received these shock, horror letters from people&mdash;and this is the way it happens in the real world&mdash;who suddenly realised for the first time that none of these conditions which were part of their awards would be guaranteed under this new legislation. One letter described in graphic detail the serious problems that one family would have been in had they not been able to exercise the condition they had for getting an air fare out of the Northern Territory in a medical emergency. Due to our small population we do not enjoy a number of specialist services&mdash;such as oncology, for example&mdash;that the more popular centres of Australia have. Those additional benefits can be fully justified and, in the past, they have been justified and approved by the Industrial Relations Commission as a result of the hard work that the unions have done collectively on behalf of us all in the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might add that education fares assistance is also on that quite long list of additional <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4227"> benefits and conditions in remote localities, none of which will be protected under the workplace relations bill that we are debating now. Just to give honourable senators who may be interested an idea&mdash;probably in most cases I think they would be completely unaware that these things exist&mdash;of just how far-flung these effects will be, I want to make the point that these remote locality benefits are not confined to the Northern Territory. A number of them are linked to areas of Australia that qualify for district allowance, and that is how the link is made in the awards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will just give the Senate a few examples of places to show how many workers will potentially be affected by this bill going through&mdash;I am sure a lot of senators will not be aware of them. These places include Broken Hill, Burke, Cobar, Coonamble, Moree, Narrabri and Walgett&mdash;all of which are in the more remote regions of the state of New South Wales. It also includes places like Atherton, Ingham, Innisfail, Mareeba, Roma, Sandy Cape, Townsville, Tully, Charters Towers, Charleville, Cairns, Bowen, Biloela and Ayr&mdash;all in Queensland. They all have award conditions, none of which are protected by this legislation. Other areas include Ceduna in South Australia, Queenstown in Tasmania, and Wilsons Promontory Lighthouse in Victoria. It is getting harder to find remote locations in Victoria but, nevertheless, they are still there. Of course, there is a long list in Western Australia, as you would expect, Madam Acting Deputy President. All of these places have significant additional provisions in their awards, none of which are protected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> I will give the Senate an example of the airconditioning subsidy that is provided as part of awards. Let me tell the Senate it is a significant expense if you live in the north. Again, there is a long list of communities in Western Australia that receive this subsidy, including Broome, Carnarvon, Dampier, Derby, Exmouth, Halls Creek, Karratha, Kununurra, Port Hedland and so on. It also applies to many localities in the Northern Territory and in Queensland. There is also a whole range of localities that currently enjoy additional leave. All of these areas are con tained in the evidence before the Senate committee inquiring into this matter. That is why I do not need to go into it any further in here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said before, the reason I wanted to raise this particular aspect that has not been canvassed before in this debate is that, when you consider the very large number of remote localities in Western Australia, Queensland, New South Wales and South Australia, I would put a very large sum of money indeed on the fact that the majority of senators in here&mdash;certainly on the government benches&mdash;would be completely unaware that so many workers in their electorates are going to be potentially disadvantaged by the lack of protection of these conditions. I am sure that I would win that bet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to confess to the Senate that I have lost a few other bets in recent days. The Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> actually bears record to the bet I had in here&mdash;I think it was in September&mdash;with the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Faulkner). I bet him $5 that Senator Short would not resign in the next six months. I did this on the basis that I am in the habit of putting small sums of money on bets that I hope I will lose. I did pay the $5 to Senator Faulkner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I was so encouraged by the investment that the following day I had a standing bet with Senator Faulkner as a job lot covering the entire ministry, including parliamentary secretaries, at $5 a head and lost another $5 on the following day. I have now paid to Senator Faulkner the $10 that I owe him. I think it is an extremely good investment in terms of the good governance of Australia at $5 a head. I am doing rather well. I am prepared to place a large bet&mdash;and I think I would win&mdash;that very few senators and I might say many government members that represent these areas in the House of Representatives would be totally unaware that the legislation that they are so enthusiastically pushing through this parliament will so severely disadvantage the workers in their regions. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was a member of the Senate Economics References Committee that held <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4228"> public hearings throughout Australia into the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996. During the course of the public hearings, government senators often raised the situation in New Zealand to support this government's agenda. My colleagues on the other side often referred to New Zealand's experience since the introduction of the Employment Contracts Act 1991 to support their case. They would have us believe that they actually know what they are talking about. I quote Senator Crane:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have also been to New Zealand and I have had a look at New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is absolutely true that wages in New Zealand from 1994 until now are less . . . I prefer to use not stagnated but stabilised in terms of that drop in unemployment from 12 to six per cent. I do not think the participation rate is relevant to that, but the important thing is that during that particular time New Zealand has got on top of its current account problem&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Crane also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When we say it has not gone into work as it has gone into profits, it has gone into balancing the budget in New Zealand, and that is incredibly important to us all.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a bit convoluted and rambling, but I think we got the point in terms of what he was trying to say.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have a look at the reality. I refer to a report called `The report of the study program on structural adjustment and social change'. The preface to this report was written by three academics. They are Mr Fred Argy, a visiting fellow in the public policy program at the ANU; Professor Fred Gruen from the Centre for Economic Policy Research at the ANU; and Professor Bettina Cass, Professor of Sociology and Social Policy at the University of Sydney. These are respected academics with no axe to grind and they clearly disputed the wisdom of Australia heading down the same path of industrial reform as New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They noted that the economic results in New Zealand, `taken in isolation', may be regarded as impressive, but to favourably compare the New Zealand economic reform path with that of the previous Labor Australian government is premature, based on the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> evidence and proper analysis. Their report makes three main points:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, New Zealand's better growth performance appears to be due more to a more rapid accumulation of raw factors of production (capital and labour) rather than to relative improvements in resource utilisation or in the quality of human capital.</PARA>
<PARA>The New Zealand factor and labour productivity growth have not been good, not even matching Australia's performance. New Zealand's reforms have had little impact on efficiency and that is not a good sign. They state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, much of New Zealand's recent strong economic growth can be attributed to temporary factors.</PARA>
<PARA>These experts claim, quite rightly, that a lot of New Zealand's recent growth is merely a catch&hyphen;up period. New Zealand's economy performed so poorly in the 1980s that a period of improvement was inevitable and this cannot be  attributed to the New Zealand process of economic reform. The third and most telling point is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The potential gains from New Zealand&hyphen;type reform need to be weighed against the social costs.</PARA>
<PARA>This bill, like the New Zealand employment act, the keystone of their reform package, is a short&hyphen;sighted or visionless quick fix. It is about providing a pool of cheap labour. It is about increasing profit for a few&mdash;and at whose expense? It can be shown that some New Zealanders have benefited significantly during the period of short&hyphen;term economic recovery&mdash;at the top end, might I say, similar to the United States. But, as this government would like to do with this bill, New Zealand went too far. I quote from the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main losers have been the already disadvantaged&mdash;low income earners and recipients of social welfare.</PARA>
<PARA>What did New Zealand do to achieve this stunning result? They dismantled arbitration and collective bargaining and replaced this with individual employee contracts. They allowed the market and social wage safety nets to be eroded. Does that sound familiar?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The New Zealand Employment Contract Act is responsible for lowering the standard of living of thousands of Maoris, migrants, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4229"> young people and women. It has seen the demise of proper industry policy and planning and led to extreme hardship where awards have disappeared, and with them paid rates and fair working conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Workplace based training has dried up to a trickle&mdash;sound familiar?&mdash;and a level of skill shortage has developed: so alarming that changes to immigration levels are being considered to solve this problem. This is somewhat ironic given the debate that is going on in Australia at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was in no small part due to the detrimental effects of the Employment Contract Act that the New Zealand parliament was held to be undemocratic and profound changes have been made to the electoral system. The first election in New Zealand under MMP was held on Saturday. The result in this election mirrored the recent polling, with one exception. Labour polled seven per cent more than most pundits predicted.</PARA>

<PARA>Obviously, people wanted a change from the Nationals' policy of industrial relations. Even the Nationals' splinter party, New Zealand First, had a pre&hyphen;election policy of reforming the Employment Contract Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It all points to the people of New Zealand seeking changes to their labour market. That is what they wanted. They wanted change. Over 66 per cent of people in New Zealand voted for parties that promised reform to this legislation and this system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope my colleagues opposite are getting the message loud and clear. It is also going to be an unpopular vote for the government. It is going to lose the government votes. Now that is fine for us on this side but, in the meantime, a lot of people are going to get hurt and suffer. That is the major point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the Senate hearings, we heard evidence on how the Employment Contract Act has been working and why it was introduced in New Zealand. Tony Short, from the school of law of the University of South Australia, told the committee he spoke to the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> New Zealand minister for labour at a conference in 1990. When he asked the minister what arguments persuaded him that this industrial reform was the way New Zealand could go, the minister simply could not answer the question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question was then answered by the chief executive officer of the employers federation, who basically said, `Our members wanted it.' That was the primary reason for the legislation. They wanted the legislation for a reason: because it provides a pool of labour which is cheap, a pool of labour which they can exploit in a relatively unfettered way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clear that this legislation was introduced purely for ideological reasons, not for the benefit of average New Zealanders. Let us look at what it has `achieved'&mdash;I say somewhat facetiously&mdash;for the workers of New Zealand. I would enlighten senators as to some of the practices taking place in New Zealand, again from evidence given to the Senate hearing. A local supermarket hired children for weekend and evening work. They were paid from $1.40 to $2.00 per hour for that work. Is that what we want to happen in Australia? I and those on this side of the chamber do not want that to happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tony Short gave an example of an employer on New Zealand's South Island, a Mr Schwartzberg ,who inserted a clause in the contract for his employees which stated that employees have to go to the bathroom in their own time. I am not sure how you would measure that. It is unbelievable, but true.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nobody seems to dispute that the deregulation of the labour market has seen real wages fail to keep up with inflation. For the vast majority of employees in New Zealand, the Employment Contracts Act has been a failure. The Employment Contracts Act has created a new class&mdash;the working poor. Is this the path we want Australia to take? I hope not. This is the path this bill is leading us down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to remind senators of a statement made by the Prime Minister, Mr Howard. Mr Howard said that the current award system will remain in place and be available for all workers. Clearly, that is another broken promise. Mr Howard should have said that he planned to reduce workers' rights to a few <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4230"> basic minima&mdash;taking from workers rights and conditions already bargained and fought for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The working men and women of Australia can be forgiven for believing Mr Howard. They did not know at that stage of the game that coalition promises come in two forms&mdash;core and non&hyphen;core. This is obviously a non-core promise&mdash;a promise the coalition believes it does not have to keep.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill does not give workers the right to choose a current award and it clearly gives primacy to Australian workplace agreements over awards. You may ask what workplace agreements will give workers. I will tell you&mdash;uncertainty in wages, uncertainty in working hours, an imbalance in bargaining power and the threat of `no sign, no start'. They will not get the choice that the coalition bleats on about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at some very real examples of what could and would happen if the coalition is successful with this bill. A year 12 student who worked as a casual shop assistant told the Senate committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I went in to work one day to find that my name was not on the roster. I approached my manager only to be told that if I wanted hours I had to sign a workplace agreement . . . a substantial reduction in my wages. I could not see any alternative so I did sign the agreement and immediately I had an abundance of work.</PARA>
<PARA>Upon reflection, this young woman changed her mind and indicated that she wanted that agreement cancelled. This act resulted in her being taken off the roster and receiving no hours whatsoever. She now has no job and no money. Another case&mdash;and this person contacted my office&mdash;is that of a person who is a qualified mechanic with 10 years experience.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clear there is no choice for employees whose employers require them to sign a workplace agreement as a precondition on being offered a job. Unfortunately, these cases&mdash;and I can assure you that there are too many like this&mdash;clearly show that the government's proposal that workplace agreements can be entered into before employment commences can only lead to intimidation of workers, diminution of wages and exploitation of workers. The signing of an agreement before you get the job is a very real concern for workers. The only choice this gives them is take what you are offered or remain unemployed. This is the government's idea of choice. This is the level playing field the government has been talking about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government seems very keen on employees signing employment contracts before they are offered a job. Why? It is leave workers with little bargaining power and out on their own without the protection of an award or a union. The only reason workplace agreements are elevated in status is so that individual arrangements are accorded supremacy over awards and primacy over any other sort of legislation, including state legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The emphasis of this bill is to take what little bargaining power workers may have through the process of collective bargaining and give it as a thank you for their support to those who already possess considerable power over workers in this nation. This government would like to see an end to collective bargaining and an end to the protection of workers through the award system. This bill in its present form will clearly allow unscrupulous employers to design workplace agreements which will remove the fair terms and conditions which workers in this country have fought long and hard for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are government members saying? They are saying that workplace agreements will be vetted and, not to worry, it is all okay. These are the same workplace agreements that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4231"> are confidential and shrouded in secrecy. This government proposes that workplace agreements do not require a pre&hyphen;agreement review. We on this side of the chamber say that workplace agreements must be reviewed in public by the Industrial Relations Commission and comply with a genuine no disadvantage test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will give a case in point. In Western Australia, under similar legislation, an employee had an agreement that said he had five days sick leave. The minimum conditions are 10 days sick leave. How could this agreement be registered? How could this agreement be valid? The employee's union wrote to the Western Australia Commissioner of Workplace Agreements, and the reply was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You will appreciate that confidentiality provisions prevent me acknowledging or otherwise indicating whether or not there is any such workplace agreement, registered or otherwise.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>With workplace agreements accorded these secrecy provisions, how can unions represent the interests of their members? How can workers ensure that they are actually getting a fair deal? These secrecy provisions are only in place to ensure that the erosion of workers' wages and conditions are kept hidden, are kept secret, so people do not know what is going on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another way this government has devised to further isolate workers and deprive them of bargaining power is this bill's right of entry provisions. In their submission to the Senate references committee on the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996, the International Centre for Trade Union Rights set out a number of fundamental objections to the bill's implementation. Objections to this bill put forward by the centre concerned the breaches of international law that this bill will entail, particularly in relation to the right to strike, the undermining of the organisational autonomy of trade unions, and the dismantling of trade union structures and the right of entry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the right of entry, the International Centre for Trade Union Rights submitted to the Senate committee that `the provisions relating to right of entry are clearly and directly in breach of international law'. The <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> majority of the Senate committee agreed that there is strong evidence to support this objection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the current situation, right of entry gives the union official the right to enter workplaces for the purpose of ensuring that workplace award obligations are followed. This right is fundamental to a union's ability to protect its members' interests, ensure compliance with workplace awards and maintain contact with its members. In relation to the union's right of entry, the majority of the Senate committee conclude:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The limits the bill proposes to place on existing right of entry arrangements should be rejected.</PARA>
<PARA>The majority of the committee noted that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . right of entry plays an important role in ensuring compliance with workplace awards and agreements, at no cost to the government.</PARA>
<PARA>It is free. This, the majority of the Senate committee submitted, gives:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . comfort to business competitors who can be more confident that they are not being undercut by unscrupulous operators.</PARA>
<PARA>Basically, it is bad business, apart from anything else. The majority of the committee also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This compliance function will be severely curtailed by the proposed need for a written invitation, and a proposed requirement that this invitation or a certificate obtained in lieu be shown to the employer. These limitations seem burdensome and bureaucratic, and could permit intimidation of employees.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is putting it mildly. Clearly, the threat posed by this bill to employees is the very real possibility of workplace intimidation by some employers&mdash;not all employers, probably not a majority of employers, but there is a proportion out there who will use it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition's proposal limits the right of entry in number of ways. It can only be exercised where one or more employees who are members of the union invite it to enter the workplace&mdash;therefore clearly allowing for identification of the employee. This will lead to workers being too scared to talk their unions about breaches, too scared to talk to anybody&mdash;their fellow workers&mdash;about breaches.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A woman contacted my office stating that she was concerned that after contacting her <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4232"> union regarding an occupational health and safety matter, employees were subjected to questioning as to who called in the union. This went on for a month after the matter had been settled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When John Howard proclaimed that the coalition would govern for all Australians, some Australians could be forgiven for believing that Mr Howard meant `all Australians'. It is not all Australians; it is some Australians. It is privileged Australians. It is those who have actually got the power currently. That is what this bill is about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition's workplace relations bill is more concerned with shoring up business alliances rather than providing an equitable outcome for all. Considering the number of shares people opposite have in business, I guess that is a reasonable outcome if you are a government.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can understand her obsession with New Zealand because, as she said in her speech, the Labor Party in Australia and the Labour <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Party in New Zealand have a lot common: they are both polling roughly less than a third of the vote.

There has been an attempt in Senator Collins's speech to suggest that she acquiesced to no-one in the course of this inquiry. On the final night of our hearings when we had the President of the ACTU attend and respond to matters that had been raised, and when I asked her a question about the ACTU's involvement and organisation of this inquiry, she said she objected to the question.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) would have us believe that there is currently an environment of economic decline, racing wages growth and seething industrial dispute, and that this is a situation that has existed since Labor won government in 1983. I just want to put on the record Senator Panizza's reference to my husband. He seems to have a particular obsession with him but I am glad to have his name put on the record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Howard justifies his attack on the working families of Australia on this basis.

Nothing could be further from the truth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The period of 13 years of Labor government was marked not by industrial uproar and dispute but by tranquil negotiation and cooperation between industry and workers.

He is nostalgic for a period of confrontation, dispute and disharmony that he remembers from when he was Treasurer, when he last held the reins of government. The vehicle that he is using to return to this era is not only his style of leadership but also this workplace relations bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill reduces the assistance previously provided to workers to enable them to negotiate on an equal basis with employers. Australian workers are not greedy. They want         just four simple things: a job, decent working conditions, fair remuneration for the work that they have done, and job security. This bill undermines these four essentials.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Howard, the present Prime Minister, made a rock solid guarantee that no&hyphen;one would be worse off. This must be one of the non&hyphen;core promises that Mr Howard made because he certainly has shown by this bill that he has no intention of keeping it. The bill is complex, convoluted and long, and neither workers nor business will benefit. It will create further administrative difficulties for business and, at the same time, nurture and encourage industrial unrest. The bill threatens reasonable wage rises, promotion on merit, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> employee redress for unfair treatment at the hands of employers, and existing conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not able to deal with the bill as a whole in the time available, but there are a number of changes that I really think need particular attention and maybe have not been focused on by previous speakers. The first is the undermining of the principle of equal pay. I must confess that, despite ideological differences with people on the other side, I would have thought that there were certain principles that are sacrosanct. But this bill and this provision certainly indicate to me that that is no longer the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill repeals the power of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to make orders in relation to over&hyphen;award payments to ensure that employees covered by the orders will have equal remuneration for work of equal value. What that really means is that the commission can no longer ensure that men and women are paid the same amount.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This occurs by schedule 8 of the bill which repeals division 2 of part VIA of the Industrial Relations Act 1988. The effect of this schedule is to repeal schedule 6 of the Industrial Relations Act, which contains the International Labour Organisation's Equal Remuneration Convention 1951 on Equal Remuneration for Men and Women Workers for Work of Equal Value.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Schedule 8 of the bill also repeals schedule 7 of the Industrial Relations Act, which contains the ILO's Recommendation on Equal Remuneration for Men and Women Workers for Work of Equal Value. It also repeals the use of the `Anti&hyphen;Discrimination Conventions' definitions contained in the Equal Remuneration Convention, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention concerning Discrimination in respect of Employment and Occupation, articles 3 and 7 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural rights and it repeals the use of `Equal Remuneration Convention' in definitions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What all this means is that this government no longer intends to comply with international conventions with regard to wages equality.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You are right. It is a major shame. It is an even greater shame that now in 1996 this government should see fit in this bill to reverse that some 24 years on. Women still receive less in wages than men. The Senate economics committee report stated that in 1992 women still received only 84.5 per cent of the total wages received by men.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is apparent that a larger part of this differential is made up of over&hyphen;award payments and cash benefits such as bonuses, work cars and entertainment allowances. Women earn only 54.7 per cent of men's equivalent over&hyphen;award payments. These over&hyphen;award payments are exactly the provisions that this bill overrides and says that the commission can no longer deal with.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems extraordinary to me that, in the face of evidence that women are still not treated equally in the workplace, this government sees fit to further undermine the quest for women to be treated equally and to have their work and talents equally recognised. Currently, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission has the power to make orders to ensure there is equal remuneration for women in straightforward wages or in over&hyphen;award payments. The fact is that women will be seriously affected by the repeal of this power. The present situation where women receive only 85 per cent of wages received by men will slip further and further as time passes and as their over&hyphen;award payments are not kept equal to those of men.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been some suggestion by the coalition government that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission will somehow be able to fill this gap. But the fact is that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission does not make industrial instruments and will not be able to in the future. Further, there is some debate that their orders are not enforceable. The fact is that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission will not be able to take on the role of the Industrial Relations Commission in preventing the slide of women's wages backwards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second area of this bill that I find particularly offensive is the changes in relation to unfair dismissal. There has been some argument put forward that, in fact, there are no major changes to unfair dismissal and that the remedies remain much the same. What the bill does in amending the Workplace Relations Act 1996 is to reduce the number of people it applies to.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commission will not have jurisdiction over employees that are not federal award employees, Commonwealth public sector employees or territory employees. Many employees will not be covered by the commission even when their state remedy is inadequate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4237"> Further, the commission's power to compensate unfairly dismissed employees is constrained. The commission must, under this bill, have regard to the viability of the employer's business when assessing for pay ment of compensation. In other words, if a business that is not doing as well as might have been expected has not paid to a worker wages that it should have fairly paid or has unfairly terminated the employment of a worker, the worker will not be compensated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite extraordinary that in the industrial arena principles such as this should be applied when they are not applied in any other forum. Can you imagine if a plaintiff suing someone for unlawfully injuring them was told that they would not be successful in their claim because the defendant's financial position was not particularly good? I do not think that would be seen as reasonable by most people and I certainly do not see that as being reasonable in the industrial arena.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third restriction that is being introduced by the bill is that the court has no power to review, vary or set aside the contracts made by independent contractors. There will be no independent industrial courts looking at these contracts&mdash;a major change from the present situation. Workers entering into these sorts of contracts will be open to unfair conditions and to dismissal virtually at a whim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are only two areas that I have dealt with. There is a vast array of others and I hope that, from the length of the debate and from the amount of interest that is being shown in this bill, all the areas will be canvassed. Unfortunately, some will be missed, but at least it will draw to the attention of members of the community what is occurring as a result of this bill and how they may well be affected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor will be putting forward a number of amendments to the bill generally. But, in relation to the areas I have raised, there will be major objection. I am hoping that that will be dealt with at a later stage. In my view, the industrial relations system under Labor and presently has worked effectively in the interests of both employers and employees. It seems unfortunate to me that this government should see fit to return industrial relations to unrest, disharmony and dispute when cooperation and negotiation are a much more effective way of getting things done.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Workplace Relations and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 is perhaps the most important piece of legislation that has come before this chamber, certainly in my time in the parliament. There are many things that I would have liked to have spoken about in this debate, but for reasons which I will mention briefly I have been asked to curtail my remarks quite considerably, as have all of those on the government side.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As all honourable senators will know, the coalition was elected by a huge majority at the last election. In my state of Queensland, the Labor Party is left with two electorates out of 26. That showed what the people of my state thought about the Labor Party, it indicated what they wanted done and it indicated their support for our policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Senate generally, at the last election, the coalition received a unique vote of confidence and achieved an almost unique victory such that in this chamber we now have the quite unusual situation where the coalition has 37 seats, nine more than the Australian Labor Party. Even if you add to that the Labor Party hangers&hyphen;on, the Australian Democrats, the coalition still has more seats in this chamber than have the Labor Party and their hangers&hyphen;on, the Democrats, combined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the way this chamber is elected, that is quite unusual. Even if you add to that the left wing of the Labor Party, the Greens, they still do not have more senators than the coalition has. That indicates the way in which the people of Australia voted for the coalition because they wanted us to implement our policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my home state, the Liberal Party in the Senate received some 680,000 votes and the National Party some 288,000 votes, a total of almost a million votes. The Democrats, by contrast, could not get a quota in my state&mdash;</PARA>

We were elected because of a number of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4238"> specific policies in addition to our general philosophy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In spite of this massive endorsement for the Liberal Party and the National Party at the last election, we have a situation now where the reforms and the legislation that we pledged to bring in have been hijacked by people, like the Greens and the Democrats, who received virtually no support from the Australian public. It is because of this selfish self&hyphen;indulgence&mdash;if that is not a tautology&mdash;of the Greens and the Democrats particularly, chatting away on matters in which Australians generally were not interested at the election, and because the Labor Party keeps regurgitating their tired old union line of class hatred, arguments that really belong to yesteryear, that we are curtailed in what we on this side have to say.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why are we curtailed? The passage of this bill is the thing most commonly spoken about everywhere I go in Queensland. No matter where I go, no matter what problems are confronting people, they always say to me, `Can you get that workplace reform bill through?', because that is the underlying element of what will get the country going and address the unemployment problem. Wherever I go, wherever my colleagues go, it is the most raised matter. That is why I will curtail my remarks&mdash;to get this bill voted on and get it into operation so that Australia and all Australians can benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the few minutes I have left I want to mention briefly a couple of things. Firstly, all of the arguments put so concisely and well in this debate by my colleagues I support. Secondly, I want to mention that this bill, when it is passed, might bring about a change to the quite scandalous situation in the sugar industry whereby the AWU holds that industry to ransom, insisting on compulsory unionism; otherwise the cane will not be harvested. Hopefully, this bill will address that particular problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, an approach was made to me and to a lot of my colleagues&mdash;and, I am sure, to people on the other side too&mdash;by a Christian group, the Brethren, which has some real concerns, not about our legislation, but about industrial relations generally. They have said, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> as I put to Mr Reith, that some concessions should be made in this bill, as has happened in the past, to ensure that the unions do not interfere in workplaces in a way that interferes with people's religious beliefs.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next point I will briefly mention&mdash;although I did want to talk about it at more length&mdash;is that of the terrible waterfront situation, one which, hopefully, can be overcome by this bill. The people working on the waterfront, the wharfies, are getting average wages of $75,000 and their supervisors some $90,000. Consequently, the ordinary, average, battling Australian&mdash;the sort of person who will be voting in Lindsay on Saturday&mdash;pays more for all of the goods that come into Australia because of present waterfront practices. I certainly hope that with the passage of this bill ordinary, average Australians, battling Australians, can get a better deal on the goods they buy because the enormous add&hyphen;on costs currently incurred across the waterfront will not be there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A colleague from Queensland, Senator MacGibbon, has asked me to refer briefly in my presentation to a pretty illogical argument put by Senator Ray in his speech. I mention it because Senator Ray usually can be relied upon for at least logical arguments in this chamber. But in his contribution to this debate he said, according to the AAP report, in relation to the Seaview Air disaster, that the aeroplane company exploited the vulnerability of pilots in order to drive down conditions and safety standards. He later went on to say that unscrupulous employers would misuse their powers over employees for commercial gain. He also said that, currently, this exploitation is illegal and able to be scrutinised by union presence.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4239">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where the illogicality comes about in Senator Ray's comments is that the actions that he complains about, this driving down of conditions and driving down of safety standards, all happened under your government, under the great workers' government, under the Labor government&mdash;and Senator Ray complains about it. If you people knew so much about it, why didn't you do something about the working conditions? So that argument is quite illogical. I indicated to Senator MacGibbon that in my contribution I would make a brief reference to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note in passing that I do not think the Labor Party have declared their interest in this debate. This debate, from the Labor Party's point of view, is all about enhancing and retaining the powers and privileges of the union movement&mdash;and all the rorts they are involved in. Mr Deputy President, would you believe that Senator Carr, Senator Childs, Senator Conroy, Senator Cook, Senator Evans, Senator Foreman, Senator Forshaw, Senator Gibbs, Senator Hogg, Senator Lundy, Senator Mackay, Senator McKiernan, Senator Murphy, Senator Neal, Senator O'Brien, Senator Schacht and Senator Sherry all came to this parliament out of the union movement.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill, when it is passed, will bring back some freedom of choice to workers.

<STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(12.02 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in opposition to the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. This bill represents the repudiation of principles that have been at the core of my beliefs and political activity since I was a high school student. Not in response to Senator Macdonald, I had prepared to say that I declare proudly my membership of the United Firefighters Union of Australia and the Miscellaneous Workers Union of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My interest is not a pecuniary one; it is not as some coalition members have suggested part of some plot to protect union power and influence; it is a reflection of my experiences, my beliefs, my philosophy, my ideology and my prejudice. The right to organise and take collective action is essential to the development of the Australian trade union movement and the Australian Labor Party. I believe that in unity is strength. I recognise the value of collective action; that in a less than perfect world where power is a factor, individuals, by combining together, can assert their rights with greater effect and success without diminishing the rights of any individual member of that group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australian society has developed with that principle as one of its cores. The Conciliation and Arbitration Act and its successors have since 1904 had among their primary objects the encouragement of the formation of trade unions of employers and employees. For 93 years the Australian Senate has held that Australian workers need the protection of trade unions and need the right to bargain collectively. That has been a view shared by both sides in the parliament. Parliament has continued to insist on ensuring these protections against the unfettered making of employment contracts between Australian workers and their employers.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4240">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The parliament has accepted that the balance of interests would otherwise be unfairly tilted in favour of employers. But this bill takes us back to prior to 1904, by rejecting the years of development of industrial relations practice in this country. This bill elevates once again the individual employment contract to a place where it is the pre&hyphen;eminent method of regulating industrial relations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The protection provided by our industrial relations system is to be removed to allow the free interplay of market forces. The bill goes much further than merely providing the choice the coalition members claim. It systematically dismantles any protection against the power of the employer in the relationship by undermining collective bargaining, restricting the rights and roles of trade unions, emasculating the role of the industrial commission and shrouding the agreement processes in secrecy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot in this speech discuss the areas that I think will be the key issues of debate in the Senate when we get commence the committee stages of this bill because I am unaware of what concessions the government has made in its secret negotiations with the Democrats. So I have to stick to generalities at this stage because, unlike Senator Macdonald, I know as everyone else does that the bill will not be passed in its entirety.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fundamental dispute in this debate, in my view, is the withdrawal of legislative support for the encouragement and promotion of collective bargaining and the bill's replacement of that approach by giving primacy to individual workplace agreements. Those of us who support collective bargaining start from the premise that an individual employee or prospective employee is at a power disadvantage in negotiating employment conditions with their employer. By joining together in a union workers can bargain collectively with their employer and a more equal power relationship is established. That is why, as part of regulating industrial relations in this country, we have always provided positive encouragement for the formation and activities of unions. As a counter measure we have always then sought to regulate their activities and make them accountable.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Employers and those who represent their interests have long feared the impact of the combination of workers and collective action. The English combination acts were designed to prevent workers combining in order to advocate their rights. Civilised society has long since recognised the fundamental importance of collective bargaining in redressing the unfair power balance faced by individual workers in dealing with their employers. Australia's international obligations to encourage and promote collective bargaining are clear and unequivocal. These obligations include support for the principle that collective representation and collective agreements or awards should be promoted and encouraged, and have primacy over individual representation and individual agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, that employees and their unions must be lawfully able to engage in industrial action to support and advance claims made in the bargaining process. Thirdly, in keeping with the principles of freedom of association and the right to negotiate freely about terms and conditions of employment, the scope of collective agreements ought not to be restricted by the authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill clearly fails to give effect to these principles and fails to honour Australia's international obligations. The bill instead gives primacy to individual contracts of employment. These individual contracts are no longer an adjunct established over and above award entitlements but will be encouraged as a superior method of regulating industrial relations. The framework of the bill provides encouragement for the development of Australian workplace agreements negotiated without the involvement of unions and largely without the involvement of the Industrial Relations Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Conservatives always seek to represent this attack on workers' rights to act collectively as redressing the imbalance that they claim was brought about by the power of unions. If they are to justify this bill, they must do more than assert that unions are too powerful. They must establish their case that an individual worker or job applicant in seeking an employment contract with an employer is not in an unequal bargaining position. I accept that in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4241"> cases of highly skilled workers who might have skills that are in demand this is not always the case; but at a time of 8&half; per cent unemployment, it is the case for most workers in Australian society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, those that argue for individual employment contracts without an award or safety net argue, in my view, for the institutionalisation of unfair bargains in the workplace. They represent sectional employers interests and not the broader community interests that this parliament should be concerning itself with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many other provisions of the bill serve to confirm the point that there is no obligation on the employer to bargain at all let alone in good faith. The bill severely curtails workers' ability to seek third party intervention in the case of a dispute, a worker's right to take industrial action is curtailed and the rights of unions to organise are severely restricted and limited. The bill is about removing the 90&hyphen;year&hyphen;old protection of workers from exploitation in individual bargaining situations where the employer enjoys superior bargaining power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not purely for parochial reasons that I now turn to a discussion of industrial legislation in my own state of Western Australia. There are a number of good reasons why a discussion of the experience in WA under the State Workplace Agreements Act 1993 and the Minimum Conditions of Employment Act 1993 are highly relevant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, the provisions of those two acts are similar to those contained in the workplace relations bill. Secondly, John Howard's stated view is that he `would like to see, throughout Australia, an industrial relations system that is largely similar to what the coalition government has implemented in Western Australia'. Thirdly, the workplace relations bill provides that a registered agreement in a state jurisdiction overrides a federal award. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, the bill not only seeks to reflect the system of primacy of individual contracts contained in the WA act, it gives further effect to that system by providing for it to operate additionally in the place of any federal award. The bill will institutionalise <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and encourage individual work contracts permitted under the WA legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fourthly, the claims made on behalf of this bill are largely the same as those made on behalf of the WA legislation at the time of its introduction. Claims, I might add, that are not seriously argued by anyone these days. Pre&hyphen;eminent among those claims are that: the employees will be offered choice and flexibility in the workplace; and that no employee will lose wages or be worse off as a result of the legislation. The WA experience clearly proves that those claims cannot be met. The experience of WA workers is quite different to that claimed by proponents of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a difficulty in establishing the case either way based on the experience in Western Australia because of secrecy provisions similar to those contained in this bill. It is very hard to get a clear analysis of the impact of workplace agreements in Western Australia. I and my office have done a lot of work collecting case studies, examining their impact and comparing them with the relevant awards. A number of other groups have tried to do the same. But you have to search out and get private access to those agreements because they are not publicly available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make it clear that there is a dichotomy in experience of workplace agreements under the WA legislation. The first group is that in highly unionised, well paid employment areas where a number of employers have successfully bought out the role of unions. They have gone to a group of workers and said, `In return for you signing individual workplace agreements, we will increase your total rate of pay and conditions instead of the award or agreement system that was in place.' That has been the experience in a number of mining company operations. It has largely occurred in cases where there were highly unionised work forces on very good wages and conditions. Some of those people would see the system as having delivered them benefits because their individual contract is now superior to that of the award. Employers have decided, to rid themselves of unions, by paying, in some cases, a very high price.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a real dichotomy in the system because the experience of the low paid and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4242"> the unskilled is quite different. Their experiences under workplace agreements are more those of having been exploited, having their conditions reduced and having very little ability to negotiate those conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The key issue advocated on behalf of this bill, as with the WA legislation, is this argument about choice. In Western Australia the legislation was much heralded as providing choice for employees. But a legal opinion written by Ian Viner QC and Regno Le Maire QC for the trades and labour council clearly established that there was no protection and no choice for employees under the WA legislation. They could sign or resign; they could sign a contract or not accept a job; and no recourse was available to them. Our experience has been that there has been no recourse for these individuals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Large numbers of people in Western Australia have gone public on their experiences under the individual contract system explaining where they have been refused a job because they refused to take a workplace agreement, or where they had their conditions diminished as a result of being forced to sign a workplace agreement if they wanted to take or retain a job. It is now common to see signs in shop windows which make it clear that if you want to apply for a job in that particular shop or establishment, you will be required to sign a workplace agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No&hyphen;one seriously argues any longer that there is a choice for employees in Western Australia. They either take the agreement, which is in many cases inferior to the award, or they do not get or keep the job. Many employees are now faced by standardised contracts drawn up by organisations such as the WA chamber of industry. All the employer does is fill in the amount of the hourly rate and hand it to the employee. Some contracts are less than a page long and barely cover the most basic conditions. It is clearly established that the contracts in place in Western Australia provide for a `sign or resign' situation or a `sign or no job' situation in terms of individual workplace agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill gives legitimacy to those contracts. This bill seeks to replicate them and it seeks to give force to their operation in Western <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australia so that even a federal award properly obtained can be overridden by a worker signing an individual contract placed before them by an employer. The government is seeking by this bill to institutionalise and further spread the workplace agreements experience we have had in Western Australia, an experience which leaves no choice to employees, which leaves them in a totally unequal bargaining position and which has seen many thousands of Western Australian workers exploited.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other claim often made in support of the bill is that no worker will be worse off. But this bill does nothing to provide minimum conditions for those on workplace agreements in Western Australia that will be recognised under the bill. The list of minimum conditions contained in the bill to apply to AWAs do not apply to individual contracts operating in Western Australia and which are recognised and given primacy by this bill. There are no provisions for a no disadvantage test applying to those WA contracts and there are no provisions for providing for conciliatory, arbitral or judicial review of those contracts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, the secrecy provisions make it very hard to do a proper analysis of Western Australian experience, but two reports have been completed. One is by the Commissioner of Workplace Agreements, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Summary Statistics and Other Information, June 1996</EMPHASIS>. The other is a WA TLC commissioned report by the Australian Centre for Industrial Relations Research and Training compiled in late 1995. The Commissioner of Workplace Agreements' report claims that the majority of agreements provide for a higher rate of pay. I think he claims that is the case in 83 per cent of workplace agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4243"> Although I cannot check the figures because of the secrecy provisions, I suspect they are probably right. My experience of looking at agreements is that what usually occurs is that the contract replaces the penalties, the overtime and all the other conditions applicable under the award with a flat hourly rate. So it is easy for the employer to offer a slightly higher base hourly rate because that is the only rate payable on all occasions. On Sun days, Christmas Day or whenever the one rate is applicable. So while the hourly rate might be slightly higher, the total remuneration package at the end of the week for a worker in a job which does not involve working Monday to Friday, nine to five, is considerably lower.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The places where these contracts have become popular have been in those sorts of industries where workers are working unsociable hours. They are not getting rewarded for those unsociable hours. They are entering into agreements which provide only for a base hourly rate to be paid on all occasions. For that, they are often employed as casuals. They are employed as casuals despite the fact they might work 40 hours or more a week and they might have worked for the employer for many years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are seeing is the total downgrading of conditions in Western Australia, the abolition of penalty rates, overtime rates, annual leave&mdash;a whole range of conditions that we would consider minimums and which the federal government in this bill says ought to be minimum conditions in terms of the operation of AWAs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The TLC commissioned report confirms that pattern of activity and confirms that workers, despite on occasions getting slightly higher hourly rates, are in fact having their total package largely reduced, which has an enormous impact on their way of life. A large number of them are having to work a huge number of hours as a result of signing the contract. As I say, they are largely employed on a casual basis. This trend has been confirmed by the Workplace Agreements Commissioner, who indicated, by way of a letter to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> on 12 February 1996:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in some of the cases the agreement offered was less than award wages and conditions and that this trend was increasing in industries that employed casuals on a regular basis.</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, in Western Australia, those with low bargaining power are having inferior workplace agreements forced upon them. The young, women, migrants and unskilled workers all face accepting contracts that diminish award conditions if they are to work. This bill incorporates that system into the federal <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> framework and seeks to replicate it in those states which currently do not have a similar system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I wish to address some remarks to the role of the Democrats in this debate. I am not one of those who seek to constantly denigrate the role that the Democrats play in this chamber, but they must recognise the fundamental conflict at the heart of this bill. As I said earlier, this bill is about repudiating the right to collectively bargain and the right of unions to organise. It seeks to overturn 90 years of encouragement and protection of those rights and, in place, elevate the individual work contract.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know the Democrats have determined that they have a political imperative to let this bill pass. They have decided they will not deny the government its Telstra sale and also its industrial relations legislation. They have announced they will give the government their bill largely intact. It is obvious that the secret negotiations they are holding with the government on the package have not gone as smoothly as hoped. I must say I am not surprised. That is because the core principles of this bill must be anathema to the Democrats. They have been the self&hyphen;styled champions of the battler. They have claimed to represent those in society without power&mdash;the unemployed, the consumer, the student, the social security recipient.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have argued for countervailing intervention in the market to protect the weak and those without power on numerous occasions. They have done this so often that Senator Ian Macdonald often refers to the Democrats as the fourth faction of the Labor Party. I know how much that hurts both of us. But it does reflect the fact that we agree on some of those fundamental principles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4244"> John Howard cannot claim victory in his long campaign on industrial relations without the core principles of the bill surviving the Senate. The Democrats cannot give him what he needs without abandoning the philosophy they have championed in the Senate for years. This fundamental attack on basic employee rights which are recognised by the ILO and all civilised society cannot be ameliorated. You cannot patch over the inherent contradic tions in promoting individual contracts and then pretend a collective bargaining system still exists. A fundamental clash of principles is at stake. There is no win&hyphen;win situation for the Democrats and the Liberals here. One must lose or one must sell out their principles. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats approached the committee process with an open mind, with a genuine desire to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the current system and to make recommendations which improve the current act and the proposed bill. In analysing the evidence, we started from three basic principles already alluded to by Senator Kernot. They were support for a strong award system, support for an independent umpire in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and support for John Howard's pre-election commitment that no worker be made worse off as a result of the government's reforms. From those principles and based on that evidence, I submitted a supplementary report to the Senate committee report outlining the Democrats' response to the workplace relations bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was these recommendations which we carried into our consultations with the Minister for Industrial Relations, Peter Reith. They are the recommendations which I believe will, if accepted, ensure that an unfair and unbalanced workplace relations bill becomes a positive and evolutionary piece of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reform legislation worthy of the support of the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Kernot has said, our discussions with the government do not preclude a full debate of the bill in the committee stage in the Senate. Some senators in the second reading debate, out of inexperience, inadequacy or irrelevancy, have been motivated to question this consultative process. We felt that private consultations with the government have been essential to permit open and frank dialogue with them designed to overcome the many conflicts that arise from our often opposing philosophies. I can say that, after over 45 hours of meetings over eight weeks, we have comprehensively canvassed all major elements of the bill. The outcome of this consultation and the amendments which we expect to flow from it will be fully disclosed when they are finalised before the committee debate commences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to briefly outline the 10 most essential ingredients for a bill to be passed by this Senate with Democrat support. The first key principle is a fair, up-to-date, enforceable and user&hyphen;friendly award system. The award system must be capable of covering the essential elements of the employment relationship. In areas like public sector employment, this should be able to take the form of a paid rates award covering all conditions of employment and the actual rates of pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We support the strengthening of the award modernisation process commenced by the previous Labor government. The process in this bill is more effective than Labor's section 150A process. We support a process that will lead to awards which are easier to understand and easiest to apply. The government has put up a model of award modernisation and simplification which we believe at this stage is too draconian. It appears to leave out many matters which are necessary for the effective operation of awards. Because the section 89A list of allowable award matters also acts as a limiter on the arbitration powers of the commission, it also fails to ensure that the commission can intervene to correct employment conditions which are harsh or unjust.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This leads to the second key Democrat principle&mdash;maintaining the central role of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4245"> AIRC as the umpire and watchdog. This is particularly important in the vetting of Australian workplace agreements. Workers, particularly the two-thirds of workers not represented by unions, need to know that they are not being dudded by their industrial arrangements. Every conservative state but Victoria has provided pre&hyphen;approval vetting of workplace agreements, and this bill should also do so. The fact that the bill as it stands does not do that is one of the worst failings of Mr Reith's package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The president of the Victorian Employee Relations Commission has been very critical of the lack of vetting of agreements under her act. Many employees, she argues, believe that agreements which have been lodged with the commission have been approved by it when this is not the case at all. As a result, many employees end up accepting substandard conditions in the mistaken belief that they have been approved. Mr Reith's bill, requiring AWAs to be merely lodged with the employment advocate, would result in similar misunderstandings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our third key principle is providing an appropriate interchange between the state and federal systems. The Democrats have in the past supported the fast-track arrangements for employees to move from the substandard Victorian system to the federal industrial relations system. That process of transfer of workers is now almost complete and should be allowed to conclude. The fast-track provisions also included the ability to obtain interim federal awards for pre-election where state award coverage was threatened. These provisions also remain of value.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill as its stands seeks to not just appeal these provisions but to allow state agreements to override federal awards. These provisions create major problems for the Democrats, as was outlined in the speech by my colleague Senator Allison.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our fourth area of concern is the ability of unions to organise effectively and responsibly. This bill contains a range of anti-union provisions which will make this much more difficult. The proposals to do away with the conveniently belong rule and open up union coverage&mdash;to severely restrict union rights to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> enter and inspect workplaces&mdash;will make life extremely difficult for unions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Industrial action could dramatically increase as unions try to prove how hairy chested they are as they seek to poach members off each other. Combined with the proposals to set up enterprise branches, the confusing disamalgamation provisions and the open-ended allowance of new unions to open up, union officials can expect to be tied up in legal wrangling in the courts for years as a result of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats support freedom of association and the removal of compulsory unionism, but an orderly conduct of trade union affairs remains an essential element of a workable industrial relations system in Australia. In the committee stage we will be seeking a fairer balance for the rights of trade unions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fifth key principle is the establishment of a decent no disadvantage test for AWAs and certified agreements to ensure that workers are not worse off as a result of entering into agreements. We believe that such a test must have three elements. It must firstly ensure that the conditions in the agreement, considered as a whole, are not inferior to the conditions provided in the award. The test is the one currently applied to certified agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It must secondly ensure that the workers have genuinely agreed to the agreement. This goes further than the government's proposed very narrow test of looking at whether the agreement was entered into under duress. It looks at the whole negotiating process instead. It must thirdly not discriminate against or unfairly exclude different classes of workers. The special interests of disadvantaged workers should be taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sixth key principle the Democrats believe must be reflected in the legislation is the protection of particular groups of workers with special needs. I would list three groups of workers&mdash;part-timers, juniors and independent contractors. Awards should not be allowed to restrict access to part-time employment to suit the whim of trade union officials. Quotas, minimum hours which are set too high and maximum hours which are set too <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4246"> low all act to do this and should be taken out of awards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Provisions which would significantly improve the lot of part-time workers&mdash;the guarantee of regularity of hours and pro rata entitlements&mdash;should be required in all awards and agreements by the legislation. That way we can prevent the casualisation of part-time employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to young workers, the Democrats in 1993 supported the insertion of the provision in the current act giving the parties three years to eliminate junior rates in awards. It remains, in our view, a fundamental unfairness that a 15-year-old worker can be paid just half the salary of a 21-year-old, working side by side and doing exactly the same work. We believe that junior wages should be replaced by wages rates determined on the basis of skills, schooling, experience and work value under the supervision of the Industrial Relations Commission. My colleague Senator Stott Despoja has already outlined our views on this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to independent contractors, the Democrats believe that there should be access to a low cost dispute resolution process, allowing contractors and other small businesses to challenge unfair contracts. Such a jurisdiction could be modelled on the provisions in the New South Wales and Queensland acts&mdash;inserted, I might add, by conservative governments. The prospect of repealing the provisions in the Industrial Relations Act for independent contractors and replacing them with nothing but the common law is, in my view, simply bad policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The seventh key principle is enforcement. The Democrats believe that the flip side of allowing responsible unions to organise without undue restriction is that irresponsible unionism, irresponsible industrial action, is subject to appropriate and effective directions. The commission does now have the power to make orders, but too often unions have ignored commission orders. The Democrats believe that the powers of enforcement of AIRC orders need to be strengthened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also prepared to review the operation of current secondary boycott provisions inserted three years ago to ensure that they <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are working effectively. In doing so, we would always insist that the enforcement provisions properly balance the commercial considerations of the employer and the industrial considerations of the dispute, particularly boycotts that are essentially primary in nature. We will oppose the extension of secondary boycott provisions to cover consumer and environmental boycotts and primary boycotts. To pick up such provisions in the Trade Practices Act or the Industrial Relations Act and to threaten environmental protesters or consumer lobbyists with injunctions, contempt of court and civil damages is, in our view, a draconian restriction on the right to peaceful protest and must be opposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The eighth key principle is ensuring that the industrial relations system is responsive to the needs of small business. I have already spoken about the need to put some teeth into the modernisation of the award system. Given that the majority of small businesses rely on the award system for key information about the labour market, this is vitally important. But I think we should also be encouraging small business to improve their workplace relations and arrangements through formalised but low cost enterprise bargaining. Small businesses wanting to negotiate an agreement at present face high potential costs engaging consultants or employer bodies to assist them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The absence of unions from this sector&mdash;90 per cent of small business employees are not in unions, just as 70 per cent of small businesses are not in employer organisations&mdash;means deals are often done in an information vacuum to the detriment of both parties. The Democrats believe that a pro-active employment advocate, geared specifically to the needs of this growing non-unionised sector, could play a major role in encouraging and mediating quality enterprise agreements for small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ninth key principle, also important to small business, is reform of unfair dismissals. The Democrats support the thrust of the government's legislation, provided the government guarantees that the system will still be open to Victorian employees. There are only a few minor technical issues which we will deal with in the committee stage.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4247">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tenth and final principle is ensuring that the bill improves the balance between work and family responsibilities. The overall package of principles I have outlined will go some way to achieving this, but more pro-active measures should also be enacted to ensure that this important object of the bill actually means something. This we believe should be developed as an effective role of the employment advocate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats will be proposing a number of amendments in the committee stage. These are still being developed in discussions with the government, the Department of Industrial Relations, the ACTU, the ACCI and others. We aim to ensure, through our consultations with government and through our amendments, that the bill is fair and balanced while moving reform of industrial relations and workplace practices forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We want to ensure that the capacity for productivity improvement is maximised by this bill, while also ensuring that workers and their families are adequately protected. That balancing act is not an easy one. I do not expect to win any popularity contests by attempting it. My aim, and the aim of the Democrats, is to ensure that the review of this legislation is governed by good policy and practicality, not by ideology or political grandstanding. I am confident that the result of the committee stage review by the Senate will be a much fairer and more workable bill than the one presently before us.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take the opportunity today to address the issue of statehood for the Northern Territory. As a senator for the Northern Territory, I am pleased to take this opportunity&mdash;and I will seek leave at the end of my speech to do this&mdash;to table the final draft constitution for the Northern Territory, which has been prepared by the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly's Sessional Committee on Constitutional Development. I will also seek leave to table an accompanying speech that the chairman of the committee, the Hon. Steve Hatton MLA, delivered in the Northern Territory parliament when the final draft constitution was tabled in August.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My interest in tabling the final draft constitution and Mr Hatton's speech in this place is twofold. Firstly, it is to inform my fellow senators and members of the House of Representatives of the progress the Northern Territory parliament has made in the area of constitutional development. Secondly, and more importantly, it is to highlight the futility of the current debate surrounding the proposal that the federal parliament override the Northern Territory parliament's legislative capacity in light of the Territory's current move towards statehood. I refer very particularly to the debate that is currently being proposed in the House of Representatives on the matter of voluntary euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Upon attaining statehood, the parliament of the Northern Territory will be within its rights, as all states currently are, to legislate without interference from the federal par liament. Given the constitutional maturity of the territory that I would argue very strongly for, I envisage&mdash;as do my Northern Territory parliamentary colleagues&mdash;that statehood for the Northern Territory will not be too far over the horizon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is certainly a view held strongly by the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Shane Stone, whose leadership in recent years has steered the Northern Territory on a new and determined course towards statehood.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would now like to take some time to examine a number of the unique features of this final draft constitution before revisiting the significance of the Northern Territory's constitutional maturity in relation to this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Northern Territory has a proud history of constitutional development as progressed by the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly since its inception in 1974. At that time, I was personally involved in the Northern Territory parliament as a member of the initial working party on constitutional issues which involved the federal and Northern Territory parliaments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1978, self-government was achieved under the Everingham&hyphen;Perron leadership. Since 1985, the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly's Sessional Committee on Constitutional Development has published a number of discussion and information papers in the lead&hyphen;up to the tabling of the final draft constitution. Mr Hatton said when tabling the document in August:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The process of constitution&hyphen;making should be an open, democratic process, with maximum opportunity for input by all the community.</PARA>
<PARA>Many of the unique features of the final draft constitution are a testament to this open consultative process&mdash;acknowledging the territory's cultural diversity and, perhaps most importantly, acknowledging the affinity the Aboriginal people of the area have with the Northern Territory. The first paragraph of the preamble reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before the proclamation of the colony of New South Wales in 1788 and since immemorial all or most of the geographical area of Australia that now constitutes the Northern Territory of Australia (the Northern Territory) was occupied by various groups <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4250"> of Aboriginal people under an orderly and mutually recognised system of governance and laws by which they lived and defined their relationships between each other, with the land and with their natural and spiritual environment.</PARA>
<PARA>This will be the first Australian constitution to acknowledge the prior existence of Aboriginal society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Throughout the consultative process, the committee received a great deal of representations from Aboriginal people who were concerned about the implications statehood would have on issues such as land rights and the protection of sacred sites. In order to safeguard existing Aboriginal interests and rights from amendment by future state parliaments of the Northern Territory, the committee has borrowed the concept of `organic law' from the Papua New Guinea system of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the transition towards statehood, the committee has envisaged that existing Commonwealth acts pertinent to the interests of Aboriginal people, for example the Land Rights Act, will be transferred across to the Northern Territory and be enacted as organic law. The concept of organic law, as it applies in this context, was explained by Mr Hatton in his tabling speech as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . such a law can only be amended in the future with bipartisan support under a special majority in the parliament, and following extensive opportunities for public debate and after inquiry and report by a standing parliamentary committee.</PARA>
<PARA>The final draft constitution also suggests that Aboriginal customary law be recognised as having the same constitutional status as common law. With Aboriginal people constituting over 25 per cent of the population of the Northern Territory, this is a very important initiative. Customary law remains an integral part of the lives and social order of many Aboriginal people in the territory and, as such, should be recognised within the constitution of the Northern Territory. The final draft constitution states that Aboriginal customary law `shall be recognised as a source of law in the Northern Territory'. In his tabling speech, Mr Hatton explained:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this is not a `two law' concept. Rather, it is designed to recognise that the Aboriginal people in the territory are presently faced with two systems of laws, one recognised by our existing constitu <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> tional system and one that in the main is not presently recognised, and can put these people in a position of double jeopardy. The challenge before us is to bring these two systems into a form of mutuality and reciprocity within a common constitutional framework, a gradual harmonisation of laws, but without any undesirable or unfair side&hyphen;effects.</PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps one of the most unique features proposed by the  committee in this final draft constitution is the incorporation of a series of rights. Whilst these rights do not constitute a bill of rights as such they do enumerate a number of rights which will in future go a long way to ensuring Aboriginal people and people who practice different cultures have their place in what will be an open and tolerate system. I note the 15th item of the preamble reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The people of the Northern Territory are concerned to preserve a harmonious, tolerant and united multicultural society, and to this end, it is desirable that no person should be unreasonably denied the right&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> to use his or her language in communicating with others speaking or understanding the same languages;</PARA>

<PARA>Part 7 of the final draft constitution deals specifically with the protection of Aboriginal land rights and Aboriginal sacred sites. Part 8 is titled `Rights in respect of language, social, cultural and religious matters'. Whilst I acknowledge the problems associated with the incorporation of a bill of rights into other constitutions, I believe the particular rights enumerated in this draft constitution will serve all territorians well, securing the future of a multicultural, multiracial community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The various provisions incorporated into the final draft constitution, which secure the interests and rights of the broad cultural spectrum of people, specifically Aboriginal <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4251"> people, in my mind demonstrate the absolute commitment of the Northern Territory parliament to responsible government. This final draft constitution enjoys strong bipartisan support within the Northern Territory parliament and is a testament to the maturity of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Overall, the current system of government will, for the most part, continue unchanged by statehood. The same Westminster model consisting of the legislature, executive and judiciary will remain, as will the unicameral parliamentary model for the Legislative Assembly. The committee has envisaged that in the transition to statehood, the current Northern Territory (Self&hyphen;Government) Act will be repealed and the final draft constitution enacted. Disruption to the current system will be minimal, with the fundamental and most important difference being that the federal parliament will no longer have the power to interfere in Northern Territory legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am confident that fellow senators and members of the federal parliament will acknowledge the hard work that Territorians from all walks of life and all political persuasions have contributed to its development. The concept of Northern Territory statehood enjoys overwhelming support not only within the territory but right across Australia, and this support is growing. Australians are obviously familiar with the territory's track record of nearly 20 years of responsible government and are receptive to the message that the territory has proven itself more than a worthy candidate for statehood.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Northern Territory economy and population is growing faster than any other jurisdiction in Australia. With an average growth rate of 5.4 per cent over the past decade, its growth is more than double the national average and is comparable with the growth of the newly industrialised countries of South-East Asia&mdash;the world's fastest growing region. The territory is perfectly positioned on the edge of this region to link Australia with what is widely anticipated to be the economic hub of the world for the next two decades.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With an estimated merchandise trade surplus of $768 million, or 15.2 per cent of GSP, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and with 67 per cent of exports channelled directly to Asia, the Northern Territory has already developed major inroads to the Asian marketplace. However, relative to the potential trading opportunities, this is really just the beginning of what is anticipated to be a long period of strong, steady growth for the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I recommend that all senators and members obtain a copy of the final draft constitution for the Northern Territory and give serious consideration to the points I have raised today. Whilst in the short term this parliament may very well be able to overturn the legislation of the independent jurisdictions of the Northern Territory, in the longer term any such attempt will prove futile.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very pleased to table the final draft constitution for the Northern Territory and also a speech by the Chairman of the Northern Territory Sessional Committee on Constitutional Development, the Hon. Steve Hatton MLA, dated 22 August 1996.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<STATE> (New South Wales)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(12.56 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I rise to discuss a matter of great public interest and importance&mdash;that is, standards of parliamentary and political integrity and leadership. Events of recent days, involving the shareholdings and conflicts of interests of certain ministers of the Howard government, demonstrate clearly that when it comes to the crunch, the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, is all talk and no action.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Howard has long trumpeted that he is a person who demands and expects the highest standards of integrity and honesty in public life. It was John Howard who went to the people on 2 March claiming that he would raise the standards of politics and of parliamentary debate in this country. I do not accept for one moment that the standards of honesty and integrity of former ALP governments under Prime Ministers Hawke and Keating were anything but of the highest order. They were governments of high integrity and high standards. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The record shows that in over 13 years of ALP governments, from 1983 to 1996, there were only a couple <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4252"> of isolated instances where ministers were required to resign. Indeed, in nearly all of those cases there was no fundamental breach of guidelines or principles. But, in accordance with Westminster traditions, the ministers nevertheless took the honourable course. The record of the Labor government contrasts markedly with that of the previous Fraser government, where it became almost a monthly occurrence for ministers to be required to resign their commission for breaches of conflict of interest or of misleading the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When John Howard, the now Prime Minister, set out to be holier than thou, when he established his code of ministerial conduct, he said to the people and to the parliament that he would expect nothing less than absolute adherence to those guidelines that he laid down. What have we seen within a period of only six months since the government came to office in March? We have seen at least five ministers be in breach of those very guidelines. Ministers Anderson, Herron and Short, Parliamentary Secretary Gibson and now Mr John Moore. Who knows? There may well be more to come as the days pass and events unfold.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Faced with this situation of these ministers being in breach, the Prime Minister has been left floundering. He has failed to act, notwithstanding that day after day proof has been given of conflicts of interests and of non&hyphen;adherence to or breaches of the code of conduct. The Prime Minister failed to act until forced to do so by circumstances and by embarrassment caused to him and to his government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> What do we get still from the Prime Minister? We get pathetic attempts to defend the conduct of his ministers&mdash;conduct which should be condemned. But, more so, we get a pathetic counterattack&mdash;a disgraceful attack&mdash;by members of the government upon opposition members simply because they happen to be members of trade unions. They attack people because they are members of trade unions, as if that meant that you are some lower form of human being and not fit to represent the people in the parliament, or indeed in any form of public life; that, some how, if you have been a trade unionist, you have never had a real job or a real commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not attack members of the opposition because they happen to be shareholders or because they happen to be company directors. We happen to believe in, and have advocated through all of our existence, the importance of the private sector in the economy of this country. But what we will attack is the hypocrisy and the failure to comply with standards of conduct demanded of ministers. It is nothing short of pathetic and disgraceful for members of the government to single out people in the opposition simply because of their membership of trade unions. I remind members of the government that people such as Lech Walesa, Nelson Mandela or Caesar Chavez have proudly spoken of their membership of trade unions&mdash;and I do not think anybody would ever suggest that they are not people of integrity and commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, on the issue of the disgraceful racist rantings of the member for Oxley, Ms Pauline Hanson, the Prime Minister has failed to demonstrate the leadership necessary, and has singularly failed to stand up for the very principles that he espouses and that I believe he adheres to. But it is not a question of Mr Howard's beliefs so much that is at issue here; it is the question of his responsibilities as Prime Minister. He has declined until very recently, I understand, to condemn in any real way the outrageous, divisive, inflammatory, scurrilous, despicable, erroneous and racist views of Ms Hanson. Despite numerous calls for the Prime Minister to speak out, he has declined. Rather, he has responded by saying that he believed in freedom of speech, and that he actually believed this had somehow been suppressed under previous governments and he was going to stand up for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Frankly, the right to free speech is something to be defended, as Voltaire so correctly put it many years ago. But the right to free speech does not involve the right to attack people because of the colour of their skin or their ethnic background. And it is about time that the Prime Minister, instead of just waxing on about the right of free speech, actually <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4253"> stood up and defended the right of indigenous Australians and Australians of ethnic background to live in a tolerant society free of racial abuse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Voltaire proclaimed those noble words, that he would defend to the death the right of people to put alternative views, I cannot imagine that he ever had in mind that that involved defending those who would seek to attack and demean people simply on the basis of the colour of their skin. Voltaire believed in the dignity and the equality of all people. That is what is at issue here and that is what the Prime Minister should stand up for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might say in passing that I note in today's press that there are now some moves towards a bipartisan approach which would involve the Prime Minister in endorsing the recent statements of the Governor&hyphen;General calling for a recommitment to the principles of reconciliation. If that comes to pass, I certainly believe that would be a vast improvement on the recent failure of the Prime Minister to stand up and be counted on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My concern&mdash;and the public concern about this issue&mdash;also extends to what is happening within the Liberal Party itself, particularly in the south&hyphen;east region of Sydney in the federal electorates of Cook and Hughes for which I happen to be the duty ALP senator. It appears&mdash;and is certainly acknowledged by spokespersons within the Liberal Party&mdash;that extreme right wing elements have infiltrated the Liberal Party in that area. Some very dangerous elements appear to be gaining influence and control. I refer to an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of 27 July and I would like to quote a few paragraphs from it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The article is entitled `P&hyphen;plate Libs in race for power' and it deals with the young members of a new right wing faction seizing control of Liberal Party branches in south&hyphen;east Sydney. The article says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Mother's Day massacre of the Menai branch&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Menai being a suburb in the Sutherland shire&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">as party moderates have described the May 12 meeting, has highlighted an internal storm that some believe could threaten the factional stability of the party in New South Wales. Moderates in the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> party have become increasingly concerned about the growing influence of a new right&hyphen;wing faction, known loosely as the Team, whose activities centre on the south&hyphen;west of Sydney. They believe the activities could tip the tenuous balance of factional dominance to the right wing of the party.</PARA>
<PARA>The article also says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">While more senior members of the party's right wing watch from the bleachers, indirectly benefiting from any advances their younger colleagues can muster, left&hyphen;wing leaders have trouble on their hands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There have been numerous complaints to party headquarters, including allegations of infiltration by extremist right&hyphen;wing groups such as shooting enthusiasts and members of Australians Against Further Immigration (AAFI).</PARA>

I will leave it at that, because I am here to speak on another matter that is actually quite important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The matter I wish to raise in this debate relates to the field station, Chiswick, outside Armidale, which is part of the CSIRO. What I want to do is put the cause for not only the retention of Chiswick but the expansion of this excellent facility. This issue began in June this year, following a decision by the CSIRO bureaucrats, which initially was to close the station altogether. This decision led to howls of protest from the local area because of the enormous contribution that people at the Chiswick Research Station have made to the northern New South Wales area. They have carried out vital research in relation to drought effects and the drought tolerance of particular pasture species. The establishment of temperate pasture species has also <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> been investigated. They have done excellent work in soil fertility and soil science research. They have carried out world leading research in animal production and reproduction and other matters relating to that, including animal health, bacterial and viral disease and the effects of parasites.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems strange that the CSIRO has decided to close such an excellent facility. I believe the original advice from the CSIRO on this matter was flawed. I would like particularly to note for the Senate that the CSIRO's action ran totally counter to a committee inquiry and report to the Senate which was tabled at the end of 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effects of such a closure in the New England area were going to be quite major. It involved the loss of over 70 staff, including senior scientists and technical staff. It involved the removal of on&hyphen;site property based research and evaluation of products for the wool and the beef industries. It would involve the curtailment of vital long&hyphen;term applied research projects and, curiously, the transfer of many of those projects to Prospect, in the middle of Sydney. Here we have a field station that involves research and involves field trials in controlled environments in a rural area, yet much of this research was going to be moved to Sydney&mdash;a very curious decision indeed, particularly when you consider that the facilities that were actually built at Chiswick, with the new laboratories, were only three years old. It was with some pride that I looked through those labs three years ago in their final stages of construction. Not to use this facility that has been set up in a rural area seems a most curious decision indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the original plans to close Chiswick were announced, Dr Malcolm McIntosh, the Chief Executive Officer of the CSIRO, was inundated with protests from the New England and north&hyphen;west region of New South Wales. Local government councils, including Armidale and Tamworth, carried out major protests. The mayor of the rural shire of Dumaresq, which surrounds Armidale, Councillor Peter Monley, led the charge to save Chiswick&mdash;to his great credit. The New South Wales Farmers Association, the University of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4256"> New England in Armidale and federal and state MPs all made deputations and representations to keep this excellent research facility open.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following the representations of a number of coalition MPs, the Minister for Science and Technology, Peter McGauran&mdash;to his great credit&mdash;revised this decision. Minister McGauran came to Chiswick in late September and announced that the facility would remain open indefinitely, initially with a staffing of 20, which has now been revised up to 35. The minister, when he did come to Armidale, set out a long&hyphen;term plan to retain Chiswick in that area. The plan involves the attraction of more private funding and collaborative research projects so that they can build on the number of the 35 staff that are left there. The government, the CSIRO, industry and the community are now working together to secure the future of this excellent research facility, and I welcome the minister's announcement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two weeks ago, shortly after the minister's decision was made public, I met with all the stakeholders in Chiswick, and regional people did greet this news with great relief. It is another example of the coalition being flexible and listening to the concerns of people in rural and regional Australia, which is quite a change after the last 13 years of Labor government&mdash;particularly, a change from the decision of the New South Wales Labor government to close the vet lab in Armidale. I do not see that government revisiting that decision. What we have done is in great contrast.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following discussions with senior researchers at Chiswick, I believe that the staff level should be increased from the announced level of 35 to ensure its long&hyphen;term viability. I have spoken to the minister about that, and will continue to make the case for Chiswick with increased staffing. The minister, I assure the Senate, is listening to that argument and that is a possible outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are excellent reasons why this overall facility should remain in place with viable staffing numbers. Firstly, there is value in applied research in primary industry carried out by the CSIRO in the country on property <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that it owns. It is central to the Chiswick research effort. It is crucial, particularly with applied research, and this cannot be carried out in the centre of Sydney, at Prospect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Chiswick and its associated properties must be retained. Research on pharmaceutical products for animals requires an intermediate stage to assess the impact of the product, and it must be carried out in a controlled environment where the scientists can actually monitor the research. This cannot be done effectively by the CSIRO on private farm animals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To take one example, there is research by the CSIRO on an agent that would de&hyphen;fleece sheep. There are real risks, if products like this are not evaluated properly, of chemical residue problems and animal welfare issues. The evaluation of this de&hyphen;fleecing agent showed a major side effect which would not have been picked up in laboratories: you had to do field station research to see it. The product did de&hyphen;fleece the sheep, but it also induced spontaneous abortions in pregnant ewes. Obviously, if you had not had the field trials, you would have ended up with a product on the market that would have had that sort of effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the case for retaining Chiswick relates to the collaborative research projects that are carried out by the CSIRO in the New England district and the University of New England; and the case for keeping that collaborative research going is overwhelming. The two institutions&mdash;the CSIRO and the University of New England&mdash;have been involved in collaborative research in this area for over 50 years. Both institutions have derived huge advantages, with young researchers gaining valuable field experience within the CSIRO. We need to retain that link and the link with cooperative research centres, because it is in the synergy between these sorts of bodies that new developments take place and Australia helps maintain its world&hyphen;class record in groundbreaking research. This is particularly the case in relation to primary industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4257"> I believe the minister will, over time, further review the staffing levels at Chiswick. Let me place on record some powerful arguments which I hope affect the eventual deci sion by the CSIRO. The current decision to keep Chiswick open with 35 staff leaves the research effort weakened. Of the 35 remaining staff, just six are research scientists. Important research projects of great value to Australia may need to be terminated or severely reduced in the current situation. For example, integrated parasite control in sheep and cattle, which has produced international cutting&hyphen;edge research, may under the plan be relocated to Prospect; a project examining the relationship between stress and immune competence in beef cattle is being severely downsized; and the sustainable grazing system project is to close, and it will be tragedy if that decision goes ahead. This project, which is now 50 years old, has been carried out on lands near Chiswick, and it is irreplaceable in terms of the way the history of the sustainable grazing system has developed. It should also be retained, particularly the world&hyphen;class work of Dr Jim Scott of UNE and soil biologist Dr Kath King.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have pleasure in putting the case for continuing a strong federal government and private sector investment in Chiswick, as the work is too valuable, and the commitment of those researchers is too dedicated, to be overlooked. Some scientists who have accepted a redundancy package will, fortunately, remain in the Armidale area, and the opportunity is there for those people to be re&hyphen;employed if Chiswick does expand further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I close by thanking the minister for the turnaround in the position and the leadership he has taken in keeping this world&hyphen;class research facility open. I urge that the government now move on from this position and that, as well as getting private assistance, it bring back to Chiswick a number of those world&hyphen;class projects to make this a viable long&hyphen;term research facility into the next century.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter that I wish to raise in the matters of public interest debate this afternoon is the ever mounting and growing bill occasioned by the taxpayers of Australia as a result of the ACTU's activities here at Parliament House on 19 August 1996.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that the damages bill to be faced by the Australian people will now, in my estimation, exceed $1 million. That is a huge sum of money. Honourable senators would be aware of my interest in this matter because on 21 August 1996, only two days after those events, in this very debate I addressed the Senate about my concerns as to what had happened on the previous Monday. At that time I pointed out that our Parliament House is a symbol of the Australian way of life and our democratic process, and that any assault on our parliament is, in fact, an attack on our way of life and our democratic process. It is an attack on our freedoms. I dealt with the matter on the basis of principle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam Acting Deputy President Patterson, if I recall, you asked a question of the President of the Senate in relation to the damages bill that was known at that time, and it was in the vicinity of $90,000. I then used the opportunity of the Senate estimates committee to determine how much actual damage had been occasioned to Parliament House itself. That questioning revealed that the damage to Parliament House and the gift shop amounted to slightly in excess of $300,000. When I got that information, I issued a media release headed `Outrage as riot bill tops $300,000'. I can tell you, now that I know that that figure was a very conservative estimate, I am a lot more outraged because of the costs that the Australian taxpayer will have to bear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You will recall that we were advised in this Senate that a damages bill of $91,000 to Parliament House was determined by Madam President some time ago. She then advised, through the Senate estimates process, that that figure would more likely be $300,000. I then had occasion, through the Senate estimates process, to ask the Australian Federal Police as to the costs that were occasioned by them in relation to the riot. I have got to say to you, Madam Acting Deputy President, that the statistics are quite horrific.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One hundred and sixteen officers were injured in the riot at parliament. Chances are that most of them would have been members of the police union, and there they were being attacked and bloodied, their ribs being broken, allegedly, by fellow trade unionists. It is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4258"> hardly the sort of behaviour that one would expect. Out of those 116 who have reported injuries, 74 members have submitted accident and injury claim forms and 12 have completed Comcare claims. In addition, as at 17 September, 560 hours of compensation leave has been utilised by members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I sought to ask the Australian Federal Police when they could give us a final figure as to the costs that the taxpayers will have to pay as a result of the riot. The answer which they provided was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not possible to provide details of the costs to be incurred by Comcare at this time as it may be several years before the extent of injuries and claims are fully known.</PARA>
<PARA>So the people of Australia will not know the damages bill that they face, courtesy of the ACTU, for approximately another few years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Simply, the cost of overtime and penalties&mdash;just that alone&mdash;that had to be paid because of the events on 19 August 1996 occasioned to the Australian taxpayer an extra payment of some $78,800. Damage to police property was $1,341.91. Damage to the personal property of police officers was estimated at $1,894.95. Travel costs for the investigations which are still under way were $2,347.40. They are the costs that can actually be quantified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are, however, a lot of unquantifiable costs at this stage, such as the cost of medical treatment and the Comcare costs, which undoubtedly will be huge because personal injury claims may well flow in consequence of the broken ribs and other injuries sustained by the 116 officers who were injured courtesy of the ACTU inspired rally. Up to 17 September, 560 hours of leave had been taken by various police officers. The cost of the investigation and the prosecution costs, to date and ongoing, are still not known. We already have actual costs in the vicinity of $400,000. It would be fair to say that, after all the legal costs, investigation costs, prosecution costs, medical costs and compensation costs are paid, all of which are not quantified at this stage, the Australian taxpayer could well be looking at a bill in excess of $1 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people of Australia need to be reminded that that occasion of the $1 million that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> they will be paying courtesy of the ACTU was described by their secretary as one of the most successful rallies ever held by the ACTU. One wonders how Mr Kelty and the others in the trade union movement judge success. One would have thought that the extent of the havoc and cost to taxpayers of the ACTU riot might have made the trade union movement engage in at least some apology and acknowledge what they were involved in, but they seem to have no shame and no concern for the odium which the ACTU and Labor must carry for their involvement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst it is quite clearly on the public record that people such as Jennie George and Bill Kelty are unwilling to apologise, we do now know that there are genuine trade unionists within the community who are prepared to apologise and who are desperate to disassociate themselves from the trade union movement and the extreme elements within it. To highlight that, as a result of Senate estimates inquiries, I was provided with certain information which included this letter from a trade unionist. I will read it into the record:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mr Speaker,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a member of a union, I was appalled at the behaviour and the destruction caused by those involved in the demonstration at Parliament House last week. I was also disgusted at the comments by Mr Kelty about the demonstration and, as a result of this, I have resigned from the union.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Enclosed in this letter is a cheque of $117, which is the amount that I owe the union as I have to give three months notice and dues when you resign. Therefore, instead of giving these dues to the union, I am redirecting the money to the parliament to help pay the damage that the union caused to our House.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a view, I suggest, which is reflected by many trade unionists right around this country. What was also revealing was two letters that were sent to the Australian Federal Police, by people who will remain nameless, indicating what their involvement in the rally and violence was. This is a letter dated 19 August, which you would recall was the day of the so&hyphen;called rally, more aptly described as a riot. The letter reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I participated in the rally on the 19th of August 1996. Whilst standing outside Parliament House, a riot broke out in which windows were broken. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4259"> Standing out front, an older demonstrator was handing out merchandise from the shop in which I accepted the goods. I did not vandalise the place, nor meant to take what was not mine. Being my first rally, I felt carried away with what was happening around me. I apologise for my behaviour and consider it to be inappropriate and have enclosed the merchandise I was handed. I have not enclosed my name in fear of prosecution.</PARA>
<PARA>Another person who wrote to the Australian Federal Police had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To whom it may concern:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am writing this letter to apologise. First I will tell you why I'm apologising. It started off when I was bored because it was my first rally I have ever been to and I had nothing to do. So I went up to the front door when everyone started pushing and I ended up in the souvenir shop where this lady was passing the souvenirs to everyone and she passed me a couple of things and then I went back outside. When I got home I realised what I had done so I wanted to return the stolen goods to you.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Neal is asking how I got these letters. A very simple process, Senator Neal: have you heard of the Senate estimates process where you can ask questions, the questions are taken on notice, and then the department responds to you? The department responded to me and provided me with those letters. It is a very simple process. Undoubtedly, the shadow minister for consumer affairs does not know about one of these important Senate procedures. But I should not distract myself with that embarrassing interjection from Senator Neal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point I want to make is this: that person who wrote said they were bored, they did not know what they were doing there&mdash;and you cannot blame that person for being bored. Just imagine having to listen to speeches from Kim Beazley, Senator Kernot, Jennie George, Bob Brown&mdash;it would drive anybody to distraction.

That allows me to highlight yet again those people's involvement in this rally, and that the honourable Leader of the Opposition used most extreme language in addressing the crowd, using the word `hate' at least half a dozen times&mdash;saying that the Liberal Party hated our Aboriginal community, hated students, hated workers, hated women. He was, of course, completely oblivious of the fact that the vast majority of women voted for us and that, for the first time, the Liberal Party scored more No. 1 votes out of the students than the Australian Labor Party did. Oblivious to all that, he used that highly inflammatory language.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In those letters, there was no hint, no suggestion, that those people's involvement was as a result of anger at John Howard or the Liberal Party's policies.

<TITLE>Regional Development: New South Wales</TITLE>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="B36">Senator NEAL</NAME>
<STATE> (New South Wales)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(1.39 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to speak this afternoon on a matter of some particular importance to New South Wales residents at large, but particularly to residents of the Central Coast, that is, the issue of regional development or, should I say, the lack of interest in regional development by this coalition government. The budget was very much bad news for the regions. The government pushed the purported positives of the budget but, at the same time, the tarnished items, the items that were going to be damaging to the community at large, were kept hidden.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tax rebates and other initiatives made families feel they were getting freebies, but there is no such thing as a free lunch, as I am sure the community will learn as time passes. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4260"> The government is putting up fees for health and associated medical expenses, for our children's education and for aged care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has particularly attacked regional Australia by targeting regional programs and closing government offices in regional areas. The coalition abolished the Department of Regional Development and this has sent a big signal to regional Australia, particularly to regional areas such as the Central Coast, that to this coalition government the people of regional Australia are not important. Frankly, I am a little bit surprised at the lack of interest in this issue that the National Party, the coalition partner, has shown. The major preoccupation of the National Party and its leader, Mr Fischer, seems to have been ensuring that the fuel rebate was retained for its constituency. But, at the same time, regional and country areas of Australia have been ignored. In fact, the whole department of regional development has been abolished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Previously the Labor government provided $150 million for the regional development organisations, RDOs. For the short period of time that these organisations existed they were quite successful. The Orana gas pipeline was established by the Orana Regional Development Organisation (ORDO) with just $2 million. This RDO covered the Riverina and Orange areas and was able to secure from the New South Wales government $42 million. As a result of receiving those funds it was able to construct a pipeline. The areas now receive natural gas at a cost which is comparable to that in the metropolitan areas of Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regional development is particularly important for the Central Coast as a unique and fast growing area north of Sydney. The cuts to regional development funds have really hurt the people of the Central Coast but do not seem to have caused a concern to be recognised by this coalition government. The Central Coast Regional Development Organisation&mdash;relatively new&mdash;received approximately $150,000 and was expected to receive further funding before the election. That has changed, of course. No further funding has been provided for RDOs whatsoever.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The RDO on the Central Coast was instrumental in trying to find further employment opportunities for young Central Coast residents. As you are probably aware, youth unemployment is a particularly large problem in areas outside major cities and certainly is a growing problem on the Central Coast. Unemployment has risen 2.6 per cent over the last month generally on the Central Coast, to 9.1 per cent. Youth unemployment in just one month has risen 4.5 per cent. Yet the vehicle for doing something about this problem, the Central Coast RDO, has no longer been provided with funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to say a little bit about Bob Kennedy, who has been the chairman of the RDO on the Central Coast since its formation and who continues to attempt to do something about the problem of youth unemployment, despite the fact that the RDO is no longer funded. Bob Kennedy is the managing director of Masterfoods on the Central Coast, one of the largest employers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well as running an effective and successful business which continues to employ large numbers of people, he sees fit to spend his time and energies in furthering the interests of the community and has shown particular concern for the generation of employment&mdash;in particular, the generation of employment for our young people in the area. Despite the RDO being no longer funded, Bob Kennedy has continued, along with other members of the organisation, to run a forum and allow young people to have a voice and to play a role in seeking out opportunities for job promotion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time as the coalition abandoned the Department of Regional Development, it abandoned significant job programs on the Central Coast. Also, through a convoluted process, the government has cut flood mitigation funding in regional areas. The government had flood mitigation programs in the Department of Primary Industries and Energy for both urban and rural areas. Prior to regional development being wound down, urban flood mitigation was transferred to the Department of Transport and Regional Development. Included in this transfer was funding for the Gosford City Council amounting to $1 <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4261"> million for flood mitigation. The government then announced in the budget&mdash;lo and behold&mdash;that the Department of Regional Development would be abolished. But it failed to transfer the responsibility for funding for flood mitigation to any other department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Losing the funds provided by the federal government is not only a tragedy, it is an extra loss for the area of the Central Coast. Previously, the funds provided federally were matched by both the state government and Gosford City Council. This means that the Central Coast community was three times worse off last year as a result of this decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All levels of governments acknowledged the difficulty of dealing with flooding problems, particularly in the area of the Central Coast which has had a rapid increase in urbanisation and a level of infrastructure development that it really is not capable of keeping up with. The Gosford City Council has budgeted to provide its one&hyphen;third of the funds for the necessary flood mitigation works but, alas, in light of the federal government's failure to recognise the problem and continue the funding&mdash;as had been provided by the Labor government for the last few years&mdash;the funds available are not going to deal with the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Work is necessary in the Wingello, Narara and Erina Creeks. Failure to deal with these problems will mean that businesses and homes are once again flooded&mdash;certainly a situation that I would not have thought this government would like to see.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Gosford City Council now has to overhaul its total drainage program in light of this funding shortfall and will have to reschedule. The problems that were going to be dealt this year will not be dealt with for many years to come. Flooding on the Central Coast is a problem, but it is only one of a multitude of problems that regional areas have. I highlight it today because it indicates the priorities of this government. Despite it being a coalition government which includes the National Party and, despite what would be a normal assumption that the National Party would be seeing the interests of rural and regional areas as uppermost in their priorities, we see that regional areas are being forgotten. Putting this <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> matter on the record, I would hope that the minds of those allocating funds might recognise the assistance required and give regional areas the priorities they deserve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have just received exactly 263 letters on this issue of flooding on the Central Coast with people explaining their concerns about flooding and how they see themselves affected. I would like to table them in the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Hill. I refer the minister to a recent statement by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, who said, `We, the Labor Party, are not yet in a position at the moment to fully devise alternatives' to economic and social policy. He said. `We need to see how deep and how serious the problems are.' I ask the minister: how does this admission sit with Labor's decision to sabotage key elements of the coalition's first budget, which has been overwhelmingly endorsed by the Australian community, and what will be the consequences for the people of Lindsay and Australia generally if these proposals succeed?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="4263" SPEAKER="Hill, Sen Robert" NAMEID="BH4" ELECTORATE="SA" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Environment" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam President, that is a very good question, if I might say. Is it not astounding that after 13 years in government Mr Beazley, a senior minister throughout that period, retired as finance minister and then said, a few months after being beaten: `We need to see how deep and how serious the problems are.' That in fact is part of the reason that they were defeated. They were not prepared to face up to the reality of the problems they created: problems of record unemployment&mdash;unemployment up to 1 million unemployed and 27 per cent youth unemployment, Senator Carr, when your side <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4264"> went out of government; the $10 billion deficit that he, Mr Beazley, left; and the $180 billion of debt. And yet Mr Beazley still today says, `We need to see how deep and serious the problems are.' It is not surprising that they were thrown out of government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting, however, that, although Mr Beazley and the Labor leadership might not know how serious the problems are, within the Labor Party they do. Since the election, there have been two studies done. The first I want to refer to was from the New South Wales Labor Party Committee. Its report included such people as Leo McLeay and Laurie Ferguson. What they pointed to as the reasons for Labor's defeat included: rampant insecurity; wage stagnation and sacrifice of conditions for every wage increase and unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not surprising that the last one is mentioned again. These are all the things that apparently Mr Beazley, the now leader of the Labor Party, wishes to overlook. They went on to include real wages decline. How often did we say from the coalition side of the chamber, that under Labor real wages were declining? But they refused to accept it. Denial, denial and more denial. And there is still denial from Mr Beazley.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Add to that study by that body of the New South Wales Labor Party the one that has been done by the federal Labor Party. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We failed to recognise or redress a deep&hyphen;seated mood of community anxiety and grievance. This related to factors with immediate impact on families, youth, unemployment, waiting lists for hospital beds, leading to scepticism about the more remote big picture issues.</PARA>
<PARA>Which, of course, the Labor Party was so carried away with at that time. There you have it again. Out of its own federal report, there is emphasis on Labor's record: unemployment, youth disadvantage, waiting lists for hospital beds and a scepticism and a disappointment that led to voters leaving the Labor party in droves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even after that, even still refusing to face up to that reality, the Labor Party expects a former minister to be voted back in at this by&hyphen;election coming up in Lindsay. On what basis do they deserve that when they are not even <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> prepared to face up to the reality of the circumstances in which they were overwhelmingly thrown out of government only a few months ago?

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a very relevant question when one talks about conflict of interest. What we have here is the most massive and undemocratic conflict of interest that you could ever imagine. Let me just explain this to you. Between the time that you were elected to government in 1983 until the time you went out, $92 million was granted by your lot to the trade union movement, and $130 million in terms of tax exemptions to the union movement. In 1992-93, the Labor government granted $5.6 million to 18 trade union bodies and $2.2 million of that came back through the revolving door. By 1994-95, $16.5 million was going to the trade union movement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You ask yourselves: what do the unions get out of this? They get a great deal. Not only did they have a place at the cabinet table but they were also able to stop industrial relations reform dead in its tracks, they made sure <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> there was a closed shop on the waterfront, they kept their very own shipping line to run as they pleased and they had appointments on the boards of the ABC, Telstra, the Reserve Bank and the Council for the Order of Australia&mdash;in other words, all those areas of political significance were absolutely dominated by an outfit that claims to represent less than one-third of the workers of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What do we have sitting on the other side? The trade union movement at prayer. Their prayers have been answered because you have 19 trade union members out of 28 in this place&mdash;totally unrepresentative of the community. It is an absolute disgrace that you even purport to come in here and represent the public interest. You do not; you are doing what your masters tell you. It is absolutely clear that you are a wholly owned subsidiary of the trade union movement. You will do what your masters tell you to do. You will not even get up and declare your interest when the Telstra bill comes on. I have no doubt at all that you will report back and get your instructions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Bishop is a classic example. He put in a submission to the Telstra committee in his capacity as a union representative and then received it as a member of the Senate and, of course, sees nothing wrong with that. They are so used to being the puppets of the union movement that they simply do whatever they are asked to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the most disgraceful conflict of interest that we could find in our society: the ordinary Australians are simply not able to be represented by one half of the Senate chamber. When you look at the fact that you have a few other odds and sods apart from the unionists, I would have thought Senator Ray has a lot to answer for. He can not only install the left wing in power in the Senate but also ensure that more and more unionists keep pouring through the doors. Since the last election on 2 March, seven out of seven new senators on the ALP side are trade union members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an absolute disgrace. If you are serious about conflict of interest, you will refrain from voting on the IR bill because you simply do not have an open mind on the subject. In <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4266"> no shape or form are you doing anything other than representing the wishes of your masters. That is where the real scandal is in this country.

I think the point you are missing is that the guidelines that I am reading and you have been reading do not in fact provide for tracing down through investments in companies that are the subject of the issue. The guidelines provide that ministers are required to divest themselves of all shares and similar interests in any company or business involved in the area of their portfolio responsibilities. As I interpret that, if the company in which the minister holds shares is the company out of which the conflict arises, there would be a need to divest. But if you are going to get to a situation where you have to explore further within the investments of that company, and that company may well be investing in another investment company, and trace that through to the investments of that company, it obviously becomes ridiculous and they are not intended to be interpreted in a ridiculous way.</PARA></TALK.START></ANSWER>

<PARA>It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Desperate to gain momentum against Mr Clinton in the last weeks of the campaign, Mr Dole's campaign described the Indonesian regime as . . . </PARA>
<PARA>And what followed was the quote given by Senator Bourne. Unfortunately, those quotes were apparently in the context of a domestic political campaign that was taking place in the United States, and obviously it would be inappropriate for me to comment on that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to Indonesia's behaviour in East Timor, across this chamber there have been <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4273"> criticisms&mdash;sometimes very severe criticisms&mdash;of Indonesia's human rights performance from time to time.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no dispute about that. I think all parties in this place would agree. Whilst we are still critical on the human rights issue from time to time, we also try to give some credit where it is deserved. What has happened under President Suharto has been an unprecedented level of stability and growth that has brought great economic benefit to many, many millions of Indonesians. I am not trying to discount the other side of the equation, but I do think it ought to be put in  the context of the whole picture. In relation to the hypothetical question, I can refer that back to the Prime Minister, but I think at this stage he would probably regard it as hypothetical as well.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

The point is that Senator Collins continues to refuse to acknowledge that there is no conflict of interest in Mr Moore holding those shares.

<PARA>The Prime Minister, John Howard, has been caught, has been engulfed and has been swamped with his <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Guide on key elements of ministerial responsibility</EMPHASIS> . We all remember after the election the puffed up self-importance with which Senator Hill came into this chamber to present the Prime Minister's guide and with which the Prime Minister presented this guide to the parliament and to the people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all remember how he waxed lyrical about these guidelines on ministerial responsibility. He was asked as recently as this morning in a press conference what action he took to ensure that these guidelines were complied with. The simple answer to that question is: <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4276"> none. This Prime Minister, who thought this guide was so important to the parliament and people of Australia, has done nothing, since it was tabled in April of this year, to ensure that his ministers complied with the guide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He went on to say the onus was not on him as the Prime Minister; the onus was on the individual ministers themselves. They had to take all the responsibility. It is the Prime Minister's guide but he was not going to do anything to ensure that it was complied with by those who had taken the Executive Council oath. That is the situation that we are faced with&mdash;a Prime Minister who did nothing about his own guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the Prime Minister was willing to take all the credit when these guidelines were brought down. When the guidelines are exposed as a complete fraud, which they have been in this parliament by the opposition in both the Senate and the House of Representatives over the last week, he moves away from them. He now says these guidelines were very similar to those brought down by the Labor Party. The much trumpeted guidelines of Mr Howard have suddenly changed. He said when he brought them down, `I understand this is the first time that such a document has been produced. The guidelines that were laid down in this document will be complied with in full.' Senator Hill said in this chamber in April:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It underlines this government's complete commitment to high standards of ministerial conduct and accountability.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Hill said in this chamber:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They are very demanding standards&mdash;there is no doubt about that. We accept high standards for this government.</PARA>
<PARA>But, once the Prime Minister has been exposed as weak and unable to make his ministers comply with these guidelines, we see a very significant change in rhetoric from the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister says now, in October, it is up to ministers to interpret the guidelines correctly and adhere to them. Those are the Prime Minister's words. He says the booklet that was published represents in substance a consolidation of the guidelines that were adhered to, presumably, one expects, by the former government. He <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> said in the House of Representatives on 15 October:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wish to say that the guidelines which were effectively consolidated by the new government when it came to power are guidelines that have now been in operation for a long period of time.</PARA>
<PARA>He has left the guidelines behind him. We have had the sacking of Senator Short, who finally fronted up to Mr Howard and said he should go. We have had Senator Gibson hit the fence as well.

I will quote a couple more examples; it is interesting to go through them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would take half an hour or so to go through the lot, but when we look at the LHMWU grant from the government, there was a donation to the ALP of $254,000. So they gave half the money, in round figures, that was granted by the government straight back to the ALP. If that is not a distortion of the use of public funds I do not know what is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the AWU since Senator Forshaw is over there: a $270,000 grant from the government, but they were a little more miserable&mdash;they only gave $56,000 back to the ALP. Look at the ASU: a $470,000 grant from the government, and they gave $83,000 back to the ALP. What a wonderful way to fund your organisation!

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to remind the Senate what this debate really is about and not be diverted into the obfuscations and red herrings that have just been drawn across it. This debate is about the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) saying to the electors of Australia before the election that he was going to introduce a new code of integrity and probity in parliament. He waved around an election promise that he was going to do this by introducing a code of ministerial conduct. That was what he pledged to the people of Australia before the election, and after the election he did introduce a code of ministerial conduct.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4278">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is being debated here is the standard of behaviour applied to the government by the government, and the standard of behaviour that they promised the electorate they would apply. And what was the relevant section of that standard, a copy of which I have here? It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When ensuring that no conflict or&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and importantly&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">apparent conflict between interests and duties arises&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and it says as well&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ministers are required to divest themselves of all shares and similar interests in any company or business involved in the area of their portfolio responsibilities. The transfer of interests to a family member or to a nominee or trust is not an acceptable form of divestment.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the standard the government imposed on itself, and this debate is about whether or not government ministers are maintaining the standard the government set. We have seen one minister and a parliamentary secretary resign because there was, to use their words, `an apparent conflict'. They resigned, and the issue is whether other ministers in this government are in conflict, or in apparent conflict, with the standard that the government has set.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In question time there were questions from Senator Schacht and me concerning the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Fischer. It should be said that no&hyphen;one on our side, and certainly not me as a former minister for trade, is complaining in the slightest that the Minister for Trade for Australia supports Australian companies overseas. That is his job. We have no complaint about that. More strength to the minister's arm for so doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The complaint is, however, that in this case the minister is clearly as well in breach of the code of conduct and is promoting the interests of companies in which he has shares and, therefore, stands to be a personal beneficiary of the public work and public duty he is performing. The problem is not that he promotes the companies; the problem is that he maintains shares in them, and the promotion he engages in therefore can advantage him either directly or apparently. It is the `apparent' part of this code of conduct which <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is what caused Senator Short to resign. No&hyphen;one said he had necessarily benefited financially, but there was a substantial question as to whether there was an appearance of him benefiting. It is exactly the same position for former Parliamentary Secretary Gibson.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But that is not the same position, apparently, that this government now wants to apply to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Mr Fischer, who, in promoting the interests of one of his major shareholdings&mdash;a company he only divested himself of shares in just the other day&mdash;obviously stood to have some advantage. Whether he did it because of that advantage or because of the apparent conflict is not the issue: the fact is he is in breach of the guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the Prime Minister has any guts, and if the Prime Minister is determined to uphold the promise he made to electors about parliamentary conduct and parliamentary probity, then the Prime Minister will insist that the Deputy Prime Minister will now tender his resignation. The issue here is whether the Prime Minister meant it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have seen on television and in the media in the last few days is the Prime Minister backtracking and running away from the undertaking he gave prior to the election. He is backtracking and reinterpreting what the code of ministerial conduct means in order now to protect ministers. He is faced with a political problem. He has found that, on his front bench, many of his ministers did not comply with the standards he set down, and some of them have gone. The government is in crisis and is haemorrhaging. In order to staunch that crisis and prevent that haemorrhage, he now reinterprets the code so that no further ones will resign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not a situation that is acceptable. The Prime Minister declared these standards; it is for him to uphold them, and it is for him to ensure those ministers uphold them as well. We know that the Deputy Prime Minister has shares in BHP, Western Mining, Qantas, TNT, Jardine Fleming, Asia Pacific and a number of other companies. He divested himself of those just the other day after the expiry of the Prime Minister's deadline. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS> </PARA>

The guidelines precisely say that if a minister or a parliamentary secretary makes a decision that would in any way benefit a company that they have an interest in, then that is a breach. Senator Short and former Parliamentary Secretary Gibson honourably came in here and said that in some way they may have breached that guideline.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, I rise to support the motion moved by Senator Faulkner. Today we had another bumbling, inept effort by the government to try to get themselves off their own hook; to try to dissemble from their own ministerial guidelines, which were trumpeted before the election and after the election by the now Prime Minister (Mr Howard) as a new standard of conduct for government in Australia. Yet, in the last 24 to 36 hours, the Prime Minister has been dumping on his own ministerial guidelines. I saw at a press conference held only at midday today that the Prime Minister is now saying, `As I read the guidelines.' He wrote them! He is now saying that there is a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4280"> different interpretation of a guideline that he actually wrote.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In question time today, Senator Hill made it quite clear that the Prime Minister is the author of these guidelines. Yet at lunchtime, at the press conference, the Prime Minister was saying, `As I read them,' `As I interpret them.' Goodness me! He should not have to interpret them. He should be able to say, `These are my guidelines. This is what it means.' But now he is saying, `As I read them,' because he is under considerable embarrassment as a result of the actions of his own party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today in the Senate we had quotes from a backbencher and the President of Senate. Senator Reid, the President of the Senate, the Liberal senator for the ACT, asked about holding shares, said, `That, to me, seems a bit absurd. I think we need have to a closer look at what we are doing.' The President of Senate said that. Winston Crane said, `To be quite frank, I think we have been quite silly.' I know that Winston does not count for much on the opposition benches, but Winston is saying, `We have been quite silly,' and the President of the Senate says, `I think it is quite absurd.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With all of that sort of pressure, the Prime Minister is now trying to think of a way to bust and break his own guidelines, which he trumpeted around the place would take the parliament to a new standard. He has now suggested there may be a blind trust established. The only thing that is blind is the Prime Minister, who now cannot see that Mr Moore and Mr Fischer are clearly in breach of his own guideline, which has now been quoted so extensively. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ministers are required to divest themselves of all shares and similar interests in any company or business involved in the area of their portfolio responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA>Black and white, without any doubt. You can understand what that says&mdash;even, I think, most people opposite. The question I asked today about Mr Fischer dealt with the fact that as trade minister over the last six months while he held shares in BHP, which he admitted in the House of Representatives today he only divested himself of earlier this <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> week, he made a number of representations on behalf of BHP. If he did not have shares in the company we would all cheer him on and say: `That is excellent. That is what you should be doing.' But it is a sheer conflict of interest, an absolute conflict of interest, to be promoting BHP in various countries around the world while you hold shares in it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Maybe if you were in the old Somoza regime in Nicaragua that would be an acceptable practice, but not in a First World, OECD nation. It will be looked on as a pretty shaky operation&mdash;in particular, when he is threatening to take the Americans to the World Trade Organisation, which would help BHP. Imagine what they would say in America, after Mr Costello's extraordinary performance leaking on Mr Greenspan. We now have an example of the trade minister owning shares in BHP and on their behalf threatening to take the Americans to the World Trade Organisation. This is an astonishing conflict of interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, if there is no conflict of interest, if Mr Howard is right with these two ministers, Moore and Fischer, why are they selling their shares? Even if it is late, even six months on, if there is no conflict of interest why are they selling their shares? They know that unless they sell the shares, even as late as it is, they cannot get out of the jam that they have placed themselves and their government in. The only thing we need now is two more resignations&mdash;that of Moore and Fischer. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

Because it was not somehow in the written code.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We go to another internal document: `Carmen Lawrence, Penny Easton affair'. This affair paralysed the government in the second <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> half of 1995. The Australian Labor Party realised the damage that the Carmen Lawrence affair did to them. They say so in their own documentation. They ought to hang their heads in shame. But what is the best form of defence? It is attack. So you attack honourable people like Senator Short and Senator Gibson, who have, I would submit, technically breached some guidelines which in my considered view need a great degree of reconsideration. Honourable people like that find themselves in the position of having to resign&mdash;but somebody as disgraceful and disgusting as the member for Fremantle can lie under oath and retain her ministerial commission. That is the difference between the standards of the government and those of the opposition in this place. I look forward to the review, and I look forward to the review including the guideline that once somebody is found to have lied under oath they will have to resign their ministerial commission.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are aiming to eliminate hollowness in Army units, thereby reducing the overall number of units, and redistributing personnel and equipment so that all established units can deploy within shorter readiness times.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will increase the number and effectiveness of combat troops by strengthening the contribution of Reservist or Part Time soldiers. Most Reserve personnel will have an initial six weeks full time training. Thereafter, ongoing training will be increased to an average of 50 days per year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Infantry, armour, artillery and engineers will be integrated into Task Forces. This principle is known as embedding. The resulting forces will be independent and largely self&hyphen;contained. They will be able to deploy to different regions in Australia and to defend these areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will create a base for adopting new technology to modernise the force. We will develop proposals for acquiring new equipment aimed at increasing the mobility and firepower of the force, including helicopters and fixed wing aircraft and more protected vehicles for infantry mobility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Higher readiness elements will contain more Full Time personnel. We will ensure that Regular forces will be able to be deployed at short notice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The application of these principles will of themselves significantly increase Army capability.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The shift from the traditional divisional structure towards flatter and more responsive Task Force structures will create units which will be flexible, capable of a range of independent operations and better able to operate in concert with the Navy and the Air Force.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reconnaissance, mobility and embedded firepower of the Task Forces should result in a versatile structure able to operate effectively in both widely dispersed and conventional operations.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At a time of great financial pressure in Defence, we must ensure that the absolute minimum necessary is spent on administration and that Defence focuses on its core functions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have appointed a panel of eminent figures from the public and private sector under the chairmanship of Dr Malcolm McIntosh, Chairman of the CSIRO, to review Defence management and financial practices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr McIntosh has been Chief of Capital Procurement in Defence; Secretary of the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce; and Chief of  Defence Procurement for the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have not given Dr McIntosh a specific savings target; indeed the Review is not a cost&hyphen;cutting exercise, but rather one designed to ensure that our <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4285"> management processes are as efficient and effective as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not want to constrain the work of the Review Panel by setting any savings figure. However I do expect that significant savings will emerge as a result of the Review Panel's reform proposals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Savings will be retained by Defence and programmed to enhance combat capabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will not be the role of the Efficiency Review to make recommendations about force structure or strategic outlook, that is something being explored by other areas of the Defence organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is, however, the role of the Review to examine all major Departmental functions. The Senior Review Panel should test underlying assumptions about current Defence management processes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have said to Dr McIntosh that I fully expect that he will find it necessary in some cases to propose fundamental changes to ensure that Defence management is as flexible, efficient and effective as possible to meet future strategic challenges.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In setting up this review I have deliberately refrained from too narrowly defining the areas in which&mdash;&hyphen; or the means by which&mdash;&hyphen; Dr McIntosh's panel should pursue its work.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have asked the Secretary of Defence, Mr Tony Ayers, and the Chief of the Defence Force, General John Baker, to provide expert senior staff for a Secretariat and for eight or so separate teams comprising both Defence and non&hyphen;Defence people, each of which will review specific management activities at the direction of the Senior Panel.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Among the key areas which will be considered for closer review are: capital equipment procurement; personnel management; corporate administration; facilities management and holdings; regional support; industry policy; provision of advice to government; logistics; health and personnel services; recruiting; science; training and financial management.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be sufficient flexibility in the review to identify and pursue new areas for investigation should they emerge during the study.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No one should doubt the urgency of this study.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are a great many things which the Defence organisation does very well. The ADF and civilian bureaucracy has many highly trained, motivated people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With this skills base, we maintain one of the most formidable and capable military forces in the Asia&hyphen;Pacific.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But there is no large organisation in the country which cannot be made more efficient through a rigorous external review. My experience is that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people in Defence are keen to see this process under way and will work hard to ensure its success.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel and I take this defence reform challenge very seriously. We are sure that the non&hyphen;Defence and private sector representatives on the Senior Review Panel&mdash;&hyphen; who form the majority of the panel&mdash;&hyphen; will add impetus and a fresh perspective to the process. But I am equally confident that the Defence representatives will give a defining sense of direction to the review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Defence budget papers show that some $2 billion of our annual ten billion dollar outlay is spent on areas directly designated as combat forces.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of the remainder, about $3 billion is spent on new equipment, facilities and the modernisation of ADF capabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That leaves around half of the budget, $5 billion, spent on everything else&mdash;&hyphen; including areas absolutely essential for Defence to function, such as logistic support, intelligence, communications, medical support, industry programs, recruiting costs, everything down to stationery and postage stamps.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The task for the Defence Efficiency Review is to determine what value for money we get from spending in all these areas. I have no doubt that Dr McIntosh's panel will find as many areas of high&hyphen;quality management as it will find areas in need of reform.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have asked that the completed report of the Defence Efficiency Review is handed to me on 10 March 1997. I will report to the Parliament after that time. I have asked the Senior Review Panel to propose an implementation strategy giving effect to its recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In developing what are two of the largest and most ambitious reform proposals in this portfolio for some years, it is appropriate for me to record my appreciation of Defence senior management for its work.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rewards of Restructuring the Australian Army and the Efficiency Review will be the development of a more flexible, efficient and capable defence force&mdash;&hyphen; a defence force better able to protect Australia's interests into the next century.</PARA>

<STATE> (Queensland)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(3.38 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These two statements before the Senate this afternoon are quite significant statements. They deal with the restructuring of the Australian army and a defence efficiency review. In the Australian army, which is to be restructured under these proposals, we have very many capable people and some very good capabilities and skills but, overall, we cannot put together at short notice an effective land combat force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The principal deficiencies are threefold, as identified by the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan): there is a lack of personnel in a significant number of the combat units; we have long lead times or training times before units can be committed to operations; and there are significant shortages of basic equipment in many of the combat units&mdash;to say nothing of major shortages of advanced technology equipment, which is increasingly seen as essential on the battlefield.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not an overnight collapse. It is certainly true that things have got a lot worse very quickly in the last 10 years, but the difficulties of creating an effective and affordable land force are very considerable. I do not think they have ever properly been addressed since the ending of the Second World War. Land operations, even with the highest of technology, are always manpower intensive, and you always require a large number of soldiers in comparison to the air force and the navy, particularly in a high technology age where the productivity of the individual member of the navy or of the air force can be really very high indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problems in creating an effective and affordable land force are enormous. I am not implying for one moment that the air force and navy are paragons of effectiveness at the present time. They certainly need some essential support in many ways but in some senses they are much closer to what we require from them than the army is at the present time.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Technology has revolutionised the battlefield. Since the Cold War has ended we are faced with two additional factors. First of all, the range of circumstances under which a defence force might be used has expanded. Secondly, at the same time our Defence Force may well be required to stand alone as an Australian force in certain circumstances, whereas, formerly, up to the start of this decade, the certainty was that we would be acting in concert with similar forces from Western democracies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The consequences of this are really very considerable for the ADF. We have a very small defence budget&mdash;we spend under half, for example, of what our regional neighbours, such as Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan, China and South Korea spend per year as a fraction of our GDP. The minister proposes to overcome these difficulties by restructuring the land force elements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Basically, what is involved is that the brigade and divisional structure will disappear, to be replaced by task forces, which will roughly be about brigade size, but they will have their own slice of artillery and armour and increased mobility, both surface and air.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The magnitude of the changes is very considerable and costly. Because of the scale of the change, it is inevitable that it will be phased in over a number of years. While the government did a very great thing in holding the defence vote and not cutting it back the way its predecessors had each year, the commitment is that, while we hold that vote, we will not be able to increase it through the life of this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The deficiencies in the numbers of personnel in the combat units will be addressed by reorganisation of regular units and expanding the role of the reserves. It is planned that the numbers involved in the combat force will increase. The deficiencies in equipment are to be rectified but the parliament should recognise that this is a very expensive process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For many years now, the reserve units, which at present comprise 60 per cent of the combat force, have had very little or no equipment of their own. They have operated on a basis of regional equipment pools, which they would draw on for their equipment when <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4287"> they went on their annual camps and exercises. But if the capability of the reserves is to be increased, then that equipment has to be provided as of their own right for the units. That is a very expensive process that will require the expenditure of very considerable sums&mdash;and you are getting close to a billion dollars, in my judgment, to do that. You cannot put a precise figure on it&mdash;no&hyphen;one can&mdash;but that is an inevitable expenditure that the country has to meet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another fundamental objective of the review is to increase the readiness levels of the combat force. Readiness in itself is very expensive and, the higher the level of readiness of a defence unit, the more disproportionately the costs rise. We have one unit, the 3rd Brigade, the ready deployment force, which is at as high a state of readiness as it is possible to hold a unit. That owes its origins really to one of my friends and former colleague, Senator Sir John Carrick, who instituted some years ago the requirement that 3rd Brigade be held at the high level of readiness that it is at present. While there is no proposal at all to raise all the combat forces to a similar high level, the discipline of maintaining 3 Brigade at that high level of readiness will be maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The program is so big that it will be introduced in stages and there will be careful trial and evaluation of its implementation. In a program of this size it will be very surprising if there are not changes that have to be made in the light of the experience gained, but it is very important that the integrity of the evaluation program is beyond dispute and it is objective. I believe that it is imperative that the assessment of the trial program is carried out by people who are independent and not serving members of the ADF.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That expertise does exist in the Australian community. It is important that the assessment of the trial program is done very objectively and impartially. The parliament, in this statement, is presented with only a brief outline of what is envisaged&mdash;and I look forward very much to the details coming on the public record in due course and the debate that will follow in the parliament.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second statement of the minister, the defence efficiency review, is a very important step also. The review willl look at, in a general sense and very broadly, the whole of the management practices within the ADF. There is not an area in defence which is more deserving of scrutiny than that. I have no problem at all with the way the defence department goes about its operational duties or runs its combat forces. From the way the air force mans its squadrons, the navy its ships and the army its battalions, I think they are all in good shape, because the operational experience over the years has been developed and tested and we know it works.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There may be a few cases where people are over&hyphen;ranked and could be dropped a rank, and we may be able to drop one or two personnel off various manning strengths in the light of changed equipment. But, by and large, that side of the house is in good shape. But navies, armies and air forces do not consist of combat units alone. They have to be supported by logistic and training establishments, acquisition planning groups and many other things. That is the area that has grown exponentially and at great cost to the effectiveness of the Australian Defence Force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In one sense, Canberra has become one vast swamp into which huge resources from the defence budget have been poured annually. If you look at the portfolio budget statements that came out last month for Defence, you find that army has an incredible figure of 571 lieutenant colonels or colonels in its establishment&mdash;that is for a very small force. We have in the air force something like 475 rank equivalents with the lieutenant colonel/colonel level, and 396 in the navy. There is no way these figures can be justified. The financial cost of this overmanning is vast. We have committees looking at committees looking at committees; we have highly ranked, highly trained officers, both civilian and uniformed, who simply lack the authority to make a decision. The system is very wrong and it is costing us hugely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I look forward very much to the report of this inquiry because I think there are very big savings to be made here in these echelons of the Australian defence department. That <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4288"> money can be employed far more effectively in the combat force and giving those people who are going to do the hard work the best chance of survival in the years ahead.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The statement read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I table for the information of Honourable Members, with a view to ratification by Australia, amended Protocol II and new Protocol IV annexed to the Convention on Prohibitions and Restrictions on the Use   of Certain Conventional Weapons which may be deemed to be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects (also known as the Inhumane Weapons Convention) of 10 October 1980. Australia is a party to the Convention and participated fully in the Review Conference which adopted amended Protocol II and new Protocol IV on 3 May 1996 and 13 October 1995 respectively. Protocol II deals with Prohibitions or Restrictions on Mines, Booby&hyphen;Traps and Other Devices. Protocol IV deals with Blinding Laser Weapons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amended Protocol II</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On coming to office, the Government ordered a review of Australia's policy on anti&hyphen;personnel landmines. As a result of that review, the Minister for Defence and I announced on 15 April that Australia would support a global ban on the production, stockpiling, use and transfer of anti&hyphen;personnel landmines, a policy we promoted at the final session of the Inhumane Weapons Convention Review Conference when it met in Geneva shortly thereafter. The new policy also suspended the operational use of anti&hyphen;personnel landmines by the Australian Defence Force. While Australia has not used landmines operationally for over 20 years and had never used them except in strict conformity with international legal and humanitarian norms,  it was appropriate for a country with Australia's strong humanitarian record to demonstrate leadership on this issue. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This new policy was and is a major achievement in foreign policy and humanitarian terms. It took Australia to the forefront of the international community's efforts to rid the world of these insidious weapons which kill or main some 30,000 people a year. Since our announcement, other countries&mdash;notably the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom and New Zealand&mdash;have moved their national positions in directions which we hope will contribute to the international momentum in favour of a total ban.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe that tragedies caused by the indiscriminate use of anti&hyphen;personnel landmines concern all Australians who have a conscience. I have received, both in Opposition and in Government, an enormous amount of correspondence from people urging Australia vigorously to pursue a total ban.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We were disappointed that a total ban was not achieved in Geneva. But the Conference did adopt an amended Protocol II which contains much stronger restrictions, prohibitions and other norms and thus provides greater protection for civilians and peacekeeping forces than does the existing Protocol to which Australia is already a party. It is an agreement worth having. And while it does not go as far as we wished on anti&hyphen;personnel landmines, it is nevertheless a first step in the process towards a total ban.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact is that Protocol II of the Inhumane Weapons Convention is the only international legal instrument governing the use of and trade in landmines. In the absence of a complete ban on anti&hyphen;personnel landmines, the revisions to Protocol II of the Convention provide interim measures which will lessen the devastating effects of these appallingly misused weapons. It is also the only international instrument restricting the use of anti&hyphen;vehicle and anti&hyphen;tank mines and so will remain important regardless of when a total ban on anti&hyphen;personnel landmines is achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new measures embodied in the revised Protocol are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, the new Protocol II extends the scope of the original Protocol to internal conflicts. This addresses one of the most often cited gaps between the old Protocol and the reality of anti&hyphen;personnel landmine misuse today.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Second, the humanitarian restrictions in the revised Protocol are considerably stronger&mdash;excessively injurious mines are specifically prohibited, anti&hyphen;sensing devices and non&hyphen;detectable mines are banned, the need to discriminate between military and civilian objectives is further emphasised and advance warning must be given of the use of all weapons covered by the Protocol.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe the aforementioned new provisions will reduce the blatant use of anti&hyphen;personnel landmines as weapons of terror. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4289"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Third, new prohibitions and restrictions on the transfer of mines will help impede the acquisition of prohibited mines and the acquisition of mines by states which are not party to the Convention or do not agree to apply the norms it embodies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fourth, the rules relating to fencing, marking, recording and monitoring of manually placed landmines and the self&hyphen;destruction/self&hyphen;deactivation standards required of this type of mine have been tightened.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fifth, the restrictions on remotely delivered mines are stronger, with mandatory recording requirements, and the requirement that anti&hyphen;personnel landmines of this type be short&hyphen;lived.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sixth, the Protocol provides for annual meetings of the States Parties and a second Review Conference in 2001&mdash;measures strongly promoted by Australia as a means of maintaining pressure for a total ban and for further strengthening of the Protocol as an interim  measure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Seventh, the Protocol provides for penal sanctions against those violating the Protocol.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And finally, a number of technical improvements should make a practical difference in the field, such as a standard sign warning of anti&hyphen;personnel landmines and a requirement that mine records be kept at a level of command sufficient to ensure their safety.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Protocol also assigns clear responsibility for the removal of mines and minefields and provides a framework for greater technological cooperation on mine clearance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the reasons I have just outlined, the arguments are overwhelmingly in favour of our early ratification of this revised Protocol. Ratification is supported by the Australian Red Cross Society, the Australian Network of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, and many, many individual Australians and other non&hyphen;government organisations. The Coordinator of the Australian Network, Sister Patricia Pak Poy, was a full member of the Australian Delegation to the Review Conference, as well as to expert group meetings which preceded it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new Protocol will enter into force six months after the 20th state party to the Convention has ratified it. Australia is keen to be among the first 20 to ratify and we will be encouraging other countries to ratify quickly, in addition to our continuing campaign to promote greater adherence to the Convention, particularly in our region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In international forums, the Australian Government will continue its role of mobilising the strong wave of support for eliminating anti&hyphen;personnel landmines as a weapon of war.   Earlier this month, we took part in an international conference of pro&hyphen;ban states and non&hyphen;government groups in Ottawa which <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> looked at future strategies for achieving a ban. We will also shortly be supporting a resolution at the 51st session of the United Nations General Assembly which embodies the objectives of the pro&hyphen;ban states and obliges others to indicate where they stand on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As well as continuing to work diplomatically, the Australian Government has increased its support for practical measures to tackle the humanitarian disaster caused by landmines. In May of this year, I announced a de&hyphen;mining programme for Cambodia and Laos worth $12 million over three years. This latter contribution will make Australia one of the major donors to the United Nations&hyphen;sponsored de&hyphen;mining and bomb clearance efforts in the region. The programme includes:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">$9 million for the United Nations Development Program and Cambodia Mines Action Centre project;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">$800,000 for Australian Defence Force technical assistance to the Cambodia Mines Action Centre;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">$1.2 million for assistance by non&hyphen;government organisations;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">900,000 to the UNDP Trust Fund for unexploded ordnance clearance in Laos;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">and funds for mine awareness training, particularly for school children.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, as I announced at the 51st United Nations General Assembly in New York last month, Australia is interested in working with other countries to seek to improve de&hyphen;mining technology, with a view to increasing the rate and scale of the de&hyphen;mining process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Protocol IV</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whereas Protocol II of the Inhumane Weapons Convention is about remedies, Protocol IV is about prevention: preventing, by means of a blanket prohibition, the use and transfer of laser weapons specifically designed to cause permanent blindness to unenhanced vision. These weapons are still in the developmental phase and to date there is no record of blinding weapons being used in combat situations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Protocol is an eminently humane measure which will also contribute to the safety of our forces in combat situations. It is timely in that it will control such an abhorrent and excessively injurious weapon before it has become widely available on the international market.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides for this government's programme of assistance to the states and territories for government and non-government schools for the 1997&hyphen;2000 quadrennium. It succeeds the States Grants (Primary And Secondary Education Assistance) Act 1992 which authorised funding for the 1993 to 1996 funding period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill fulfils the government's commitments to promote excellence and achievement through the provision of quality education and prepare our young people for an active and productive life both in the workforce and as participating citizens in the community and global economy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill fosters a partnership approach with states and territories which recognises both the constitutional responsibility of states and territories for education and the Commonwealth's role in guiding national directions and priorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main theme of the bill is the importance of choice in providing for improved educational outcomes for Australian students. The bill further supports the devolution of decision making about education to parents and communities to ensure that education is responsive to student needs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will provide choice for better options for the future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill provides for significant reform in the emphasis, availability and administration of the Commonwealth's schools programmes. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4291"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To support these changes, the bill will appropriate in excess of $14 billion for the coming quadrennium under a rationalised set of programmes which this government believes best meets the needs and aspirations of those in school-level education. The major part of this funding will continue to be directed to the general recurrent and capital grants programmes. The government has, however, decided to replace a complex array of more than 40 school-related programmes of targeted assistance by a streamlined set of 5 programmes, namely:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> literacy;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> languages; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> special learning needs;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Which are included in the bill before us;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And two other programmes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> school to work; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> quality outcomes;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The funding for which is included in other legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A strong determination to secure the foundations of effective learning is behind the government's policy of ensuring that all students are provided with literacy and numeracy skills.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Illiteracy is the worst form of poverty and a blight on society. The government's literacy programme of more than $150 million annually is one of the government's most important equity programmes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The literacy programme subsumes the general support element of the English as a second language programme and the disadvantaged schools programme. It will also replace the early literacy programme which was due to end in 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Funding is to be provided under the literacy programme for a new national literacy and numeracy strategy directed at improving the literacy and numeracy skills of school leavers. The bill will appropriate some $45 million for this purpose for the next three years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many young people, especially those who are educationally disadvantaged, leave school without the literacy and numeracy skills essential for further study or sustained employment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Two factors will ensure the strategy's relevance to the problems being faced by young people. First, it will draw upon the results of the national schools English literacy survey which are scheduled to be released early next year. Secondly, it will identify best classroom practice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All of this will underpin progress towards Australia's first national literacy goal&mdash;that every child leaving primary school should be able to read, write, spell and communicate at an appropriate level. Progress towards this goal will be measured by national literacy benchmarks at year three and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> year five which the Commonwealth government will develop in conjunction with state and territory governments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The languages programme, which is the second in the group of priority initiatives, and for which more than $100 million is included in the bill, provides funding for the national Asian languages and studies in Australian schools strategy and for the teaching of community and priority languages.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the languages programme is directed at the teaching of a wide range of languages other than English, it gives particular emphasis to Asian languages and cultural studies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clearly, it is important to the development of Australia's trade relations for businesses in this country to have leaders and staff who are proficient in Asian languages and who have an understanding of Asian cultures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The special learning needs programme, which is the third priority initiative, includes funding for three tightly targeted areas addressing the needs of clearly identified clients. These areas are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Special education for students with disabilities;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Provision of intensive English language instruction for newly arrived migrants; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Provision of supplementary educational services for students in country areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill contains some $636 million over four years for the special learning needs programme. The programme will have as its objective the full participation in schooling of students with specific educational needs and the subsequent realisation of their maximum potential in the workforce.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Returning to the theme of choice, the broadbanding effected by this bill, which has brought together a number of related programmes, will give schools a degree of flexibility in determining their priorities which they have never had before. Schools will be able to respond to the changing needs of students and direct their resources to achieving the best possible learning outcomes for their students.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to the literacy, languages and special needs programmes, which are directed at particular needs in the school community, the bill also provides in excess of $11 billion for general recurrent grants and some $1.2 billion for capital grants, including an additional $30 million for non&hyphen;government schools capital grants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fourth priority initiative which I mentioned earlier, and for which funds will be included in other legislation, is the school to work programme. This programme is intended to make the transition from school to work a natural and successful process for all students.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The final initiative, which will be covered by the appropriation bills, is the quality outcomes <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4292"> programme. This initiative unites a number of programmes directed at teacher development, the civics and citizenship programme and the projects of national significance programme. The unified programme will provide a sharper focus on the achievement of quality outcomes in schooling while giving recognition to the fact that teachers play a key role in the academic and social development of children.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is vital that teachers have access to quality and regular professional development opportunities to enhance their expertise and professionalism and the programmes contained in the bill will allow for that to occur.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Emphasising the theme of choice, this bill legislates a new and more equitable policy for non-government schools seeking Commonwealth funding. This policy replaces the attempts of the previous government to impose a bureaucratic, unfair and inequitable burden on non&hyphen;government schools seeking Commonwealth funding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The application process under the previous government's new schools policy was bound in red tape as was the process for reviewing the funding category of those schools already in receipt of funding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Furthermore, the labor government's new schools policy confined non-government schools approved for funding since may 1988 to a maximum funding level of category 6. This arbitrary restriction has jeopardised the existence of many deserving schools worthy of a higher level of support from governments. It also restricted parental choice in non-government schooling for their children, especially for low income families.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This government's policy for newly commencing schools will make a school's entitlement to Commonwealth funding primarily dependent upon state or territory government recognition. There will, of course, be a requirement that schools be run by an incorporated body, be non&hyphen;profit-making and enter into an agreement with the Commonwealth. Non&hyphen;government school funding will, however, be both simple and equitable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government believes that parents should have the choice between schools in both the government and non&hyphen;government sectors and between schools in each sector. The government has no preconceived ideas about the size of either sector. It is important that Australia has a strong government school sector and a strong non&hyphen;government school sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cost to the Commonwealth of a student attending a non&hyphen;government school is more than the cost of a student attending a government school. Conversely, the cost to a state or territory of a student attending a government school is more than <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the cost of a student attending a non&hyphen;government school.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This, coupled with the fact that the proportion of students in non&hyphen;government schools has increased from 24.4 per cent in 1983 to 29 per cent in 1995, has meant that states and territories have had the potential to cost shift and save on the education of students in government schools.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Against this background, the government has decided to preserve for the Commonwealth 50 per cent of net recurrent savings to a state or territory from students shifting from the government to the non&hyphen;government sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Grants to the states and territories for government schools will reflect the choices of parents between government and non&hyphen;government schools. This decision is to be effective from January 1997 and operate at least for the 1997&hyphen;2000 quadrennial programme for schools.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many of the provisions of the bill are familiar, as they also appeared in the States Grants (Primary And Secondary Education Assistance) Act 1992. Those provisions have been placed in a more rational structure. This is a reflection of the grouping of some of the previous programmes into the 5 priority initiatives I referred to earlier. It also reflects efforts to reduce the amount of repetition prevalent in the previous act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the first time, the bill contains provisions to ensure comprehensive reporting on the application of financial assistance provided to schools. This will be achieved through a strengthened national report on schooling in Australia with a range of core data showing what our students are learning and where the greatest needs lie. This information will be a key factor in the Commonwealth's future policy responses in the area of schooling.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill provides the bulk of a 5 per cent increase in total Commonwealth funding for schools. In financial year terms this means an increase from $3.3 billion in 1995/96 to $3.4 billion in 1996/97. This demonstrates the government's commitment to ensuring that Australia's young people gain the best possible education opportunities to make the most of their future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of this bill be adjourned until the first sitting day of the autumn sittings in 1997, in accordance with the order agreed to on 29 November 1994.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill introduces many of the initiatives affecting the social security portfolio that were announced either as part of the Government's 1996 election commitments or as part of the 1996 Budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government made election commitments to carers. It is now proposed to give effect to these commitments by changing the name of carer pension to carer payment and by extending from 10 to 20 hours per week, the number of hours that carers may spend in employment, voluntary work, education or training without affecting their qualification for carer payment. There will also be an increase in the number of days in a calendar year, from 42 to 52 days a year, that a carer may temporarily cease caring without affecting their qualification for carer payment. These initiatives will commence on 1 July 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the moment, youth training and sickness allowees receive a rate of $65.75 a fortnight even if their parents' income and assets would have otherwise either resulted in a lower rate or precluded them from payment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides for the abolition from 1 January 1997 of this minimum payment for customers aged under 18. The parental income test will then be applied to determine the actual rate of payment. This will ensure that there is a more consistent payment structure for youth, as there is no such minimum for AUSTUDY recipients.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Social Security Act 1991 and the Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973 will be amended from <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 20 September 1997 to consolidate and simplify voluntary work provisions in those acts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A person aged 50 and over who is not subject to an activity agreement, will be able to satisfy the newstart allowance activity test by undertaking approved full&hyphen;time unpaid voluntary work for an approved organisation for an unlimited number of days per year for at least 32 hours in a fortnightly period or by a combination of unpaid voluntary work with an approved organisation and suitable paid work for at least 40 hours in a fortnightly period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similarly a person aged under 50 who is not subject to an activity agreement, and who has received income support for at least 3 months will be able to satisfy the activity test by undertaking full&hyphen;time voluntary work with an approved organisation for six fortnights in their first 12 months of income support.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A person will still be required to be available and willing to undertake suitable paid work.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government made an election commitment to improve and tighten administration of the activity test for unemployment payments. This commitment was made in response to community concerns that only those people who are genuinely unemployed and actively seeking to participate in the workforce should receive payment. The measures contained in this bill seek, as part of a wider package of initiatives, to increase community support for assistance to the unemployed by enhancing the integrity of the program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measures will tighten the definition of `unsuitable paid work' for job seekers, change the non&hyphen;payment period for activity test breaches, replace the current deferment period arrangements for administrative breaches with rate reduction provisions, tighten activity test breach provisions relating to voluntary unemployment and refusal of a job offer, reclassify certain breaches as activity test breaches, extend the non&hyphen;payment period for moving to an area of lower employment prospects from 12 to 26 weeks and clarify the operation of the employer contact certificate provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, amendments are included in the bill to change the industrial action provisions in the Social Security Act and the Student and Youth Assistance Act to ensure that where a person is unemployed as a result of industrial action the person will remain disqualified for payment for 6 weeks after the industrial action has ceased.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These measures relating to the unemployed will commence on 1 January 1997. The bill also contains two discrete measures dealing with waiting periods to be implemented from 20 September 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, the unused annual leave waiting period will be abolished and replaced with an income mainte <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4294"> nance period. The new income maintenance period rules will ensure that leave payments are treated as income from the date of payment over a period equal to that for which the leave refers and apply to newstart, sickness, partner, widow and parenting allowances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, the maximum length of the liquid assets test waiting period, which applies to claimants of newstart allowance, youth training allowance and sickness allowance will be extended to 13 weeks and will be variable depending upon the person's available funds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill gives effect, from 20 March 1997, to a number of measures relating to people who are sick and who claim, or are receiving, certain social security payments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A 14 day grace period will be introduced so as to allow a person to renew qualification for sickness allowance, or to renew exemption from the newstart or youth training allowance activity tests, through providing the necessary medical certificate after the expiry of the person's previous medical certificate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sickness allowance qualification rules will be amended by removing the loss of income qualification. Also to be amended are the sickness allowance qualification rules and newstart allowance and youth training allowance activity test exemption rules so that the sole criterion for the continuation of sickness allowance, or exemption from the newstart or youth training allowance activity test, will be a continuing temporary incapacity for work.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Lastly, backdating of disability support pension, newstart allowance, sickness allowance and youth training allowance will be permitted through the deemed earlier date of lodgement of a claim, in circumstances where a sick or disabled person makes a telephone inquiry about claiming payment and then lodges a claim formally and qualifies for payment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Due to its conceptual and procedural complexity, the earnings credit scheme is difficult to administer and is also difficult for social security recipients to understand. The limited understanding of the scheme by social security recipients puts in doubt its value as a significant incentive to take up casual work opportunities. Given this, as well as the relatively high costs involved in the administration of the scheme, the Government has decided to abolish the earnings credit scheme in respect of both pensions and benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill introduces amendments to abolish the earnings credit scheme from 20 March 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has also decided to abolish the employment entry payment from 20 March 1997 and the education entry payment for all but certain pensioners from that date. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Provisions for assistance to widows and partners were reviewed in the 1996 Budget context in response to the need to develop a more rational and integrated social security system, simplify the payment structure and improve services to customers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result, the bill gives effect to a number of measures designed to provide common payment conditions for older women without recent workforce experience, who either are a dependent partner or who lose the support of a partner later in life, as well as ensuring common payment arrangements when customers attain age pension age.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, qualification for widow allowance will be extended  to women who are aged at least 50 years of age and who were widowed, divorced or separated after turning 40 years of age.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, conditions of payment of widow allowance and partner allowance will be aligned, including common phase&hyphen;out arrangements, a common definition of recent workforce experience and common access to ancillary payments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thirdly, qualification for partner allowance will be extended to AUSTUDY, ABSTUDY and Student Financial Supplement Scheme partners.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fourthly, there will be an earlier phase&hyphen;out of widow B pension such that there will be no new entrants to this payment and by automatically transferring widow B pensioners of age pension age to age pension.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, arrangements for customers of age pension age will be rationalised by no longer granting widow allowance and partner allowance to people of age pension age and by automatically transferring widow, partner and mature age allowance recipients attaining age pension age to age pension.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These measures are to be implemented from 20 March 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides for the assessment processes for disability support pension to be tightened to ensure that those people whose impairments have only a relatively small impact on their overall ability to work will not qualify for that pension. Rather, they will receive a more appropriate income support payment. To assist in this process, revised impairment tables, which are used to assess whether a person's impairment is 20 per cent or more, are being introduced from 1 January 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government decided in the 1996 Budget to limit payment of child disability allowance arrears to a period of up to 3 months where a person has made an earlier claim for a payment similar to child disability allowance and was qualified to receive child disability allowance at the time of this earlier claim. Currently, child disability allowance arrears of up to 12 months may be paid in such <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4295"> circumstances. The bill gives effect to that decision from 1 January 1997 and will result in child disability allowance being treated consistently with other social security payments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides for the amendment of the compensation recovery provisions of the Social Security Act so as to include age pension as a compensation affected payment. The proposal will only apply to age pensioners who receive compensation for economic loss. Age pensioners who receive compensation for non&hyphen;economic loss only would not be affected. The proposal would only affect an age pension if the compensation is received on or after 20 March 1997 and the person's provisional commencement day for age pension is on or after 20 March 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The compensation recovery provisions of both the Social Security Act and the Student and Youth Assistance Act will also be amended from 20 March 1997 to enhance the treatment of lump sum compensation payments by using a single pension cut&hyphen;out point as the compensation lump sum preclusion period divisor.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For compensation lump sum payments received on or after 20 March 1997, the divisor used to calculate preclusion periods will be changed from the all persons average weekly earnings to the amount above which no pension is payable to a single person under the income test, currently $397 a week. Further, the preclusion period will be applied to the compensation recipient only and not to his or her partner. This means that for lump sums received on or after 20 March 1997, recovery of past payments to partners will not be made, nor will partners be precluded from receiving any future entitlement they may have during their partner's preclusion period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The existing rules will apply in respect of those compensation lump sum payments received before 20 March 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also includes a number of amendments to the Student and Youth Assistance Act so as to align the compensation provisions of that act with corresponding provisions in the Social Security Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill includes a number of amendments that are designed to improve the targeting of non&hyphen;cash assistance to retirees and low income earners, restore equity by preventing cards being given to people otherwise not entitled and simplify card administration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The health benefits card will be abolished and health care cards will be issued to sickness allowees. The "savings provisions" that allow people receiving family allowance supplement prior to January 1992 to receive a health care card will be repealed . These people will now have to test their eligibility under the normal four&hyphen;weekly income test. Similarly, the modified income test <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and savings provisions that allow certain social security pensioners to receive concession cards after cancellation of pension will be repealed. These measures will take effect on 1  July 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides for the removal of the concessional treatment applied to "deposit concession money", as defined in the Social Security Act and the Student and Youth Assistance Act, from 20 March 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result, the "below threshold rate" of extended deeming will apply to the first $2,000 of available money or deposit money of a person other than a person who is a member of a "pensioner couple" as defined in the Social Security Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The "below threshold rate" will also apply in all cases to the first $4,000 of available money or deposit money of a "pensioner couple".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Social Security Act and the Student and Youth Assistance Act will be amended, from 1 October 1997, to provide for recovery of social security payments that have been paid to persons in excess of their correct entitlement but which are not currently recoverable as debts. In addition, where possible, the debt creation provisions will be rationalised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recovery of overpayments will occur according to the means of a person to pay. This will improve equity between customers, some of whom are now able to retain more than their correct entitlement even though they have ample capacity to repay, while others with limited finances are obliged to repay their debts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, the bill provides for the modification of the advance payment scheme for recipients of social security entitlements. The modifications include removal of a `permitted purpose' as a qualification requirement for an advance payment, reduction of the maximum advance amount to $500 and restriction of the number of advances payable to a person to one advance in 12 months. This measure will take effect on 1 January 1997.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, I am the last <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4296"> speaker, apart from the minister, the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp), on this Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996. There has been a marathon debate about this matter, and justifiably so. It is a very important bill which will affect&mdash;in my view, adversely&mdash;hundreds of thousands of people within Australia, and not only workers but also their families. The issue of fairness will be undermined substantially by this bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I realise that, before the luncheon adjournment, Senator Andrew Murray of the Australian Democrats was speaking and I was to be the next speaker. I apologise to the Senate that I was not present at that time because I was otherwise engaged in a situation from which I could not extract myself. I thank the Senate for its courtesy in delaying the debate until this moment. I will repay that courtesy with a similar courtesy, namely, restricting my observations to about 10 minutes. If that is a message to the minister to come in and respond in about 10 minutes time, I hope he gets it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy President, permit me to make some simple observations about this workplace relations bill. Permit me to do so from a perspective of 40 years involvement with the trade union movement and with workers in a variety of industries, not only areas such as administrative and clerical, the commercial shops, manufacturing and the wharves, but also some of the essential services areas, such as fire brigades and ambulances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Permit me to do so from a perspective of 35 years of commitment to orderly industrial progress, to peace between employers and employees, between union and management. I have been committed to that, not through the narrow interest of the trade union movement alone, but with a commitment to the development and prosperity of industry and commerce within Australia. Indeed, the Tasmanian Trades and Labour Council, of which I was secretary for a number of years, changed its objective from the old one of socialisation of the means of production, distribution and exchange to one of encouraging the creation of an economic and social order in which persons can live with freedom and dignity and pursue both their spiritual <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> development and material wellbeing in conditions of economic security and opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was against the background of those principles that I operated. It was at times at some considerable cost. In the 1960s there were a number of key unions which believed in what the government now believes, which is smashing conciliation and arbitration. They believed in exercising muscle to the extent that `survival of the fittest' was their motto. That, of course, had detrimental effects on those who were least able to withstand that sort of pressure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am talking about my own state of Tasmania when, because of shipping disputes and the like, that state was held to ransom. It fell to me and the council, and the supporters that we had in the council, to uphold fairness and justice for the workers of Tasmania against those who were attempting to smash arbitration&mdash;principally the unions in the shipping and wharf area. But they were very often assisted by their employers because the stevedoring industry was a cost&hyphen;plus industry, and the greater the cost, the bigger the plus for the employers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as I was concerned, I believed that there should be balance and fairness, and we should not operate on the basis of the spoils going to the fittest; that is to say, the survival of the fittest. In fact, in many of those years the whip hand was held by the trade union movement because in many of the industries there was scarcity of labour. Now of course the government appears to look around and see that there is not that scarcity of labour, that there is a surplus of labour in many areas and that the employers do have the whip hand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think Senator Ray mentioned on Friday last week the case of that airline where pilots were doing almost anything to get up hours and they were working without pay. As a result of that there were a crash and, tragically, deaths. The commissioner who was chairing the inquiry had specific points to make about the working conditions that applied in that area which resulted in the endangering of the lives of the passengers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Deeply ingrained in the consciousness of the Australian people is this concept of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4297"> fairness and equity. We have heard it all, over the years, `Fair go.' That is a common Australian comment. The antithesis of fair go is the survival of the fittest. That consciousness which is ingrained in our societal views was there in the last century and it was placed in our constitution in relation to industrial relations. If anybody has read books about Henry Bournes Higgins they will have seen what was being said both in the debates and the convention and, probably more importantly, outside. There it is in section 51(xxxv) of the constitution. Section 51(xxxv) is very clear. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conciliation and arbitration for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State.</PARA>
<PARA>It is that constitutional provision which enables this parliament to so act that it is being undermined by the workplace relations bill. Yes, the wheel has turned. In my view this piece of legislation will not affect the fittest workers or the fittest or strongest organisations, but it will affect the weak, those least able to defend themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe we have been told by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) that, if this measure is enacted, no worker, no employee, will be worse off as a result. I am prepared to go outside this chamber, out the front, and take a bet. I will give the minister London to a brick on, if he wants, that that will not occur. In other words, there will not be no worker worse off as a result of the passage of this legislation, there will be thousands of workers worse off as a result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not going to canvass what has been said. Almost everything possible that could be said about this matter has already been said by the 40 or so senators who preceded me in this debate. I am not going to trawl over old ground but the essence of this bill is to undermine the power of workers who are already weak and to undermine their representatives. An example of why that statement by the Prime Minister would not be accurate&mdash;I <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> do not suggest he is deliberately stating an untruth, but I believe he is very poorly informed&mdash;is the fact that contracts under state jurisdictions will override the provisions of federal awards or certified agreements meaning, ipso facto, as far as Western Australia is concerned there will be hundreds of people who are immediately worse off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, there is an attack on the organisations of workers. The membership agreements, for example, that are commonplace now as a result of enterprise bargaining agreements where employers and unions have negotiated wages and working conditions, job security and the like, should also be able to be incorporated into those instruments under the new legislation&mdash;provided, of course, they are endorsed by the employees concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another aspect is the allowable items which are down to 18 conditions. I do not quite see how this will ultimately be regarded as constitutional. Nevertheless, if this particular bill purports to be based on the conciliation and arbitration power, I cannot see that that would stand up to an appeal to the High Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of other issues which I just want to mention briefly: the reduction of the powers of the Industrial Relations Commission to the 18 conditions and the removal of the power of the commission to regulate superannuation, which is a very important thing. The government has encouraged superannuation, but workers ought to have a good deal of control over where their money will go and that can and should be done in many areas within the conciliation and arbitration system itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister, or one of the ministers, indicated that this measure is required to boost employment. It probably will boost employment&mdash;part&hyphen;time employment. It will cut substantially full&hyphen;time employment because the bill removes the ability of awards to regulate part&hyphen;time work and that is of great concern indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another area mentioned in debate is the abolition of the ability of the Industrial Relations Commission to scrutinise workplace agreements&mdash;AWAs&mdash;before they come into force. Another one is the restrictions on the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4298"> right of entry provisions and that will affect a lot of workers or potential workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not intend saying anything more. My observation is that this bill is so fundamentally flawed that it ought to be defeated at the second reading.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;The debate over the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill in the Senate over the last few days has been characterised by a large number of inaccurate and misleading statements by the opposition. I will be able to deal with only a few of these statements in the time available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to begin by addressing some of the more general attacks that we have heard on the government's reforms. In particular, four statements by the opposition misrepresent the content of the bill and the intent of the government. They wrongly claim that the legislation represents a fundamental attack on the independent umpire, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission.They wrongly claim that the legislation represents a fundamental attack on the award system. They wrongly claim that it represents a fundamental attack on the rights of workers to participate in collective action. And they wrongly claim that the government is aiming to force workers currently under awards and collective agreements onto individual contracts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning to the first of these wholly unfounded assertions, Senator Sherry, among many others, claimed that the workplace relations bill represents an attack on the independence of the AIRC. He is wrong. It is not the government's policy to attack the commission. Rather, the government proposes making a series of changes to the role of the commission and, in some cases, actually enhancing the commission's role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes to the role of the commission are consistent with the other changes shifting the emphasis of the system to agreement making. While there will be less emphasis on arbitration, the commission will maintain an award safety net of fair minimum wages and conditions, including through determining claims for safety net adjustments. It will also oversee the award simplification process and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> review awards to ensure provisions are flexible, easy to understand, non&hyphen;discriminatory and geared to the needs of individual workplaces and enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The commission's conciliation role will continue and it will have an important responsibility to encourage the making of agreements between employers and employees at the enterprise and workplace levels. The commission will have a strengthened mediation role. As part of the conciliation process, the parties will be able to request the commission to make a recommendation in relation to matters that they cannot agree on. There will be an express provision requiring the commission to make recommendations in such circumstances and where it is satisfied that the parties will comply with the recommendation. If such a recommendation is ignored, the commission will be able to refrain from dealing with matters involving that party&mdash;an end of formal bargaining period for a certified agreement&mdash;which would end the parties' rights to take protected industrial action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The commission will have stronger and clearer powers to stop or prevent industrial action. It will have the power to make orders to deal with disputes between registered organisations over the representation of workers where a business is being adversely affected. It will also have the power to resolve disputes where all attempts to reach an agreement have failed and the disputes threaten serious harm to the community or the economy. In addition, the commission will have responsibility for unfair dismissal matters in the federal jurisdiction. I repeat: this is not a weakened commission or a less independent one, but it is a commission whose role has changed consistent with other changes proposed in the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second claim made by Senator Sherry is that the workplace relations bill represents a major attack on the award system. Once again, this is not the case. The proposed legislation is not designed to attack the award system; rather, it is designed to ensure that the award provides an effective safety net of fair minimum wages and conditions. At the same time it maintains the focus of the overall system of award making at the enterprise or <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4299"> workplace level. Awards will continue to provide minimum wages and conditions and the AIRC will have jurisdiction to determine safety net adjustments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consistent with our policy set out in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Better pay for better work</EMPHASIS>, awards will be simplified. This will involve limiting the matters to be included in awards and ensuring that they are more flexibly expressed, with other matters to be determined at the workplace and enterprise levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Award simplification is important. It is important in encouraging employers and employees to agree at the workplace about matters of detail or process that are best settled at the workplace level. It is crucial to deliver flexibility in how award provisions are to apply. It is part of a broader process of encouraging dialogue at the workplace about ways of increasing productivity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Award simplification is not&mdash;I repeat, not&mdash;a device to reduce wages or key conditions. The allowable matters to be included in awards will cover all key matters relating to pay, allowances and conditions of employment. In addition, awards can include provisions that are incidental to these allowable matters and essential for the effective operation of the award. Labor broke its promise to simplify awards which it made in March 1993 and again in its Working Nation statement of 1994. This government will meet its promise of a simpler, more efficient award system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well as criticisms of the award simplification process, there has been a lot of propaganda suggesting that teachers, nurses and other employees currently covered by paid rates awards will be made worse off when they move to minimum rates awards. The truth is they will not have their wages cut if their paid rates awards are phased out over time and after consultation with the parties. The process of converting these awards to minimum rate awards will occur consistent with the government's guarantee on take home pay and will be overseen by the commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> One of the main reasons that paid rates awards are no longer necessary is that many of the workers covered by paid rates awards have already entered into workplace or enter prise agreements. For this reason, their paid rates awards no longer specify their actual rate of pay. This is the case for many teachers and nurses. In this era of workplace bargaining, the government believes there is no need to continue with different types of awards for different groups of workers. It is true that all awards, including paid rates awards, will be simplified in their scope and reviewed to streamline their operation. But this will not involve reducing the level of existing entitlements for the allowable award matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third claim made by the opposition is that the workplace relations bill represents a fundamental attack on the rights of workers to participate in collective action. The opposition is wrong here, too. The government is not attacking the rights of workers to participate in collective action or attacking the legitimate role of unions; rather, the government's policy is about giving employers and employees choice in how they handle industrial relations in the workplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The workplace relations bill will provide employees with the right to take collective industrial action in appropriate circumstances. Consistent with accepted principles of collective bargaining, the legislation preserves the right to take industrial action in relation to genuine bargaining for agreements. At the same time, the public will be protected against any strike action that threatens health, safety or lives. In this way, the legislation provides a fair balance and protects the interests of employers, employees and the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to union membership, the government believes that, just as workers should be free to join a union, so they should be free not to join. The government is also ensuring that if workers choose to join a union, they have a choice about which union they join. The bill will make membership of all organisations truly voluntary. Compulsory unionism and preference will be prohibited. This will be achieved by removing matters which relate to preference from the jurisdiction of the AIRC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unions will still have right of entry to workplaces. However, the proposed legislation will ensure that this right operates within <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4300"> reasonable limits and is not abused. Similarly, Australian workplace agreements are not about keeping unions out of the bargaining process; rather, they are about providing workers with more choice. Unions can still represent employees if employees want them as their bargaining agents. However, uninvited union involvement will be excluded. The new options available in terms of bargaining agents will lead to greater competition and encourage unions to provide better service to members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth claim made by the opposition is that the workplace relations bill is aimed at forcing workers currently under awards and collective agreements onto individual contracts. This claim is again incorrect. The workplace relations bill is about providing employers and employees with much greater choice about how to regulate their relationships. It puts the emphasis on direct workplace relationships and on the mutual interest of the employer and the employee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More direct employment relationships will give enterprises the flexibility to change and adapt to circumstances and maintain a competitive edge. At the same time, such relationships will enable employees to formalise arrangements which deliver the flexibility that they want. This is not a one size fits all system; it allows people&mdash;employers and employees&mdash;to tailor arrangements to suit them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under this bill the options for agreement making will be significantly expanded and simplified. The parties will be able to choose whether they want informal over&hyphen;award arrangements or whether they want to formalise their agreements. They will also be able to choose whether they want to negotiate collective agreements with or without union involvement or negotiate individual agreements. If they choose the latter, they will be able to decide whether to bargain themselves or seek the services of a bargaining agent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, all formal agreements will be subject to statutory requirements to ensure that employees are protected. The bill also includes significant protection against an employee being forced to sign the new form <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of agreement, that is, an Australia workplace agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well as the general claims made by the opposition in this debate, there are a number of specific claims that need to be firmly rebutted. The first of these is the claim by a number of opposition senators that the proposed principal object for the new act does not put sufficient emphasis on fairness and the interests of employees. The proposed legislation is clearly based on a fair go for all so that the system is appropriately balanced and delivers benefits for both employees and employers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The objects are not aimed at taking sides. Instead, they are aimed at providing avenues for mutual choice, mutual commitment and mutual benefit. The objects of the new act will focus the role of awards on minimum standards and the protection of the low paid; encourage the determination of terms and conditions of employment as far as possible by agreement between employers and employees, either individually or collectively, at the enterprise or workplace level; and protect freedom of choice in relation to agreement making and membership of employer and employee associations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A key part of the proposed principal object of the bill is `respecting and valuing the diversity of the work force' by helping to prevent or eliminate discrimination on specified grounds. There is also a new emphasis on assisting employees to balance their work and family responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second specific issue I want to address relates to our proposed amendments to section 152 of the existing Industrial Relations Act which provides employers and employees with greatest choice in relation to state and federal agreements. Senator Sherry has claimed that this amendment breaches the government's guarantee that no worker will be worse off as a result of the workplace relations bill. This claim is clearly nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment proposed to section 152 will prevent a federal award operating where employees currently have their employment regulated by a state employment agreement or where employees freely enter into a new state employment agreement. The amendment is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4301"> consistent with our election promise to allow employees and employers to choose the jurisdiction and the nature of their legal relationship. Contrary to some claims, employees will not be forced from federal awards onto state awards. For those who are covered by federal awards and who want to make agreements under a state jurisdiction, the legislation will provide access to such agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third wild assertion that I wish to tackle was that made by Senator Foreman, who stated that the proposal for junior rates of pay means that people will be working for amounts that are no more than social security payments. As any reading of the bill shows, juniors, trainees and apprentices will not have their wages cut under the government's proposed new arrangements. The Industrial Relations Commission has established award rates of pay for these employees, and it is those rates that are incorporated into our system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Juniors will continue to be paid at the award rate prescribed for their age whether they are employed under an award or workplace agreement. That is, no change. Where there is an award rate of pay established for the particular traineeship, including a national training wage traineeship or an apprenticeship, that rate will continue to apply whether they are employed under an award or workplace agreement. That is, no change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only area of change is for new traineeships and apprenticeships where currently there is no relevant training award rate of pay. That will generally occur because a new traineeship or apprenticeship with a different work&hyphen;training mix has been developed under the modern Australian apprenticeship and traineeship system. For these, the wage will be the most relevant award rate adjusted for time spent in training. The principle that trainees be paid only for their productive work is already used in the national training wage, which was agreed to by unions and endorsed by the commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where the training component is increased under a full-time traineeship or apprenticeship to a point where the wage falls below an appropriate level, the government will provide a top up to the weekly wage for MAATS <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> trainees employed under the new wage arrangements. The top up will be to the following guaranteed minimum levels for full-time apprentices and trainees: up to $128 for 16-year-olds, $158 for 17-year-olds and $195 for 18-year-olds and above.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These rates are based on the current minimum national training wage rates. The top up levels are substantially higher than the top up levels implemented for trainees by the previous government and agreed to by the ACTU. Our proposals in this area will not only protect current employment but also encourage more young people to take up traineeships. Under the Brereton laws, junior rates cease next year and some employers estimate this could cost young people 200,000 jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final point I wish to make about the debate on the bill relates to claims by a number of senators that the government's reforms will adversely affect vulnerable employees. Specific concerns have also been raised about the bill's treatment of equal pay for work of equal value without discrimination based on sex and part-time employment. I want to assure the Senate that the government is committed to ensuring that all workers have fair access to the opportunities to be provided through this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like all employees, these employees will be able to benefit from the broad set of changes outlined in the legislation. In particular, they will be able to negotiate agreements that reflect their individual circumstances. For example, workers with family responsibilities will be able to negotiate agreements which provide for more flexible working hours. Provision has been made for protection against discrimination in awards and agreements. In a particular case of pay discrimination, the proposed workplace relations act in combination with existing provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 will ensure that equal pay for work of equal value without discrimination based on sex applies to awards, agreements and over award pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4302"> Australia will continue to fully meet its international obligations in this area. Dismiss al based on a range of discriminatory grounds will continue to be unlawful. Awards will continue to provide a safety net of fair minimum wages and conditions for all employees, and the AIRC will be required to have particular regard to the needs of the low paid when adjusting the award safety net. Employees will have a range of statutory protections when they choose to enter into agreements with their employers. The employment advocate will be there to provide advice and assistance to employers and employees who want to make use of our new flexibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to part-time employees, the new workplace relations act will ensure that employees have access to part-time work on a regular basis with pro rata benefits. Employers and employees of the workplace and enterprise level will be able to agree to regular part-time agreements. Also, outdated award restrictions on regular part-time employment will be removed from awards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many unions have opposed the introduction of regular part-time work. Others have included restrictions such as limits on maximum and minimum weekly hours and quotas designed primarily to protect the interests of full-time workers. Workers who have preferred regular part-time employment of more or fewer hours than allowed for in awards are therefore forced to remain in full-time work, to accept casual employment or to remain outside the paid work force. The new act will increase the opportunities for employees to work less than full-time hours while having predictable work hours, greater job security and access to the conditions enjoyed by other permanent employees on a pro rata basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, it needs to be stressed yet again that, despite the assertions made by the opposition, the workplace relations bill will provide significant benefits to Australian workplaces and will provide increased opportunities for flexibility for both employers and employees. In addition, by creating opportunities for innovative enterprise agreements that improve productivity, all Australians will be the winners.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on behalf of the opposition and, I believe, the large majority of Australians to oppose the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill. A majority of the Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts References Committee made a number of recommendations, of which the fundamental one was that Telstra should not be sold.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this bill, we have a proposal by the government to sell one&hyphen;third of Telstra&mdash;for approximately $8 billion, the government's estimate&mdash;and one&hyphen;third of that will be sold to foreign interests. The Senate committee report on this bill made it quite clear in a number of areas that this bill is unnecessary and that this public asset is worth keeping in public ownership for a range of social and economic reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One thing that surprised all the members of the opposition, including the Democrats, on the Senate committee was that we waited for the government to produce a major reason&mdash;major empirical evidence&mdash;to justify the sale of Telstra. And we waited and waited.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">DOCA, the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston), Telstra, the finance department and other supporters of privatisation ended up quoting one report, the 1992 World Bank report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Privatisation: the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> lessons of experience</EMPHASIS>. DOCA's submission described the World Bank report as `perhaps the most compelling overall review of the effects of privatisation and its relationship with liberalisation'. DOCA also said `this is the only comprehensive study we are aware of that covers a range of privatisations and also attempts to analyse the outcomes on the basis of comparisons to reasonable counterfactuals in each case'.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Finance also placed great significance on this report, referring to it as a major study and quoting at length from its conclusion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does the 1992 World Bank report refer to? It refers to 6,800 privatisations around the world in about the last decade and a half. Of these, 4,500 were in the former German Democratic Republic, the old East Germany, and 6,100 were in Eastern Europe altogether, Latin America and the Caribbean. As an example of the benefits accruing from the privatisation, the study pointed to `a previously near moribund textile company in Niger,' `a finance company in Swaziland' and `an agroindustrial enterprise in Mozambique'. Just 170 of the 6,800 privatisations occurred in OECD countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other studies relied on by supporters of privatisation included&mdash;and this is a classic list&mdash;the Polish cement and lime sector, the Odessa meat company, the Swarzedz Furniture Company in Poland, the Trinidad and Tobago Methanol Company, textiles in Tunisia and&mdash;the one that tops the whole list&mdash;privatisation in Haiti.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that for a report to rely on the privatisation in Haiti as an example of why you should privatise Telstra really is one of the most extraordinary arguments I have heard. We know that for about a century or more Haiti has relied on voodoo philosophy. Now we have the minister relying on voodoo economics from Haiti to justify the sale of Telstra, a profitable company, in a First World economy, by comparing it with Haiti, a Fourth World economy that has been through more unfortunate experiences than most of us care to recount.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those reports clearly showed all the time that privatisation occurred where companies were not profitable. In the Third World, all <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4304"> these thousands of companies overwhelmingly were privatised because they were losing large amounts of money. So what is the comparison with Telstra? Telstra is not a loss making company. It is a profitable company, performing very well in public ownership. It was performing very well when the previous government introduced the GBE reforms to how publicly owned companies should run themselves, and of course has since the introduction of competition in 1991&hyphen;92 by the previous government. Every proponent of privatisation admitted under oath at the inquiry into the sale of Telstra that the most significant improvement occurs when you introduce competition. The privatisation issue is really only a little bit on the side where a few percentage points may occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I questioned the Department of Finance and DOCA, could they give us examples of the advantage of privatisation over and above competition from any experience in the world that is measurable? We got two stunning examples: two electricity companies in Chile in the early to mid&hyphen;1980s, when the Pinochet dictatorship, noted for its human rights abuses, was running Chile. They were the only two examples the finance department, DOCA and Telstra could come up with to justify some advantage to privatisation in improving efficiency. In one of the cases, the improvement appeared to be no more than 1&half; per cent improvement in productivity. In another case, they said one of the things that privatisation brought about was a reduction in the theft rate in one of those companies in Chile. I must say I have never seen any evidence that theft in Telstra from its own employees is a major problem that has had to be addressed. I have not seen any large numbers of Telstra employees being dragged off to the courts because they are consistently thieving from Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the absurd examples this government and its departments have relied upon to justify the privatisation of Telstra. Telstra is a profitable company. On 13 September, Telstra announced a profit after tax, abnormals and minority interests of $2.3 billion for the year ended 30 June 1996. On the day these massive profits were announced, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> business editor Alan Kohler said on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> that Telstra's unit costs per line are now below the average of the world's telecommunications companies for the first time. Kohler commented:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . they're 8 per cent below the average of the world and they're planning now to stay there.</PARA>
<PARA>On the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> , Kerry O'Brien asked Alan Kohler:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So would partial privatisation force greater efficiency on Telstra?</PARA>
<PARA>His response was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, that's already happening, that's the point.</PARA>
<PARA>A comment from a commentator such as Kohler is far more persuasive than the very dodgy examples that the World Bank study produced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Ian Martin from BZW, a company strongly in favour of privatisation, gave evidence accordingly before the Senate committee. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On a range of benchmarks, Telstra stacks up very well against overseas companies.</PARA>
<PARA>Telstra's pretax return on capital for 1993&hyphen;94 was 22 per cent; world's best practice is over 20 per cent. In 1994&hyphen;95, return on investment was 21.8 per cent and in 1995&hyphen;96 it increased to 22.9 per cent. Telstra's interest cover for 1993&hyphen;94 was 5.3 times; world's best practice is over 5.5 times. In 1994&hyphen;95, Telstra's interest cover increased to 8.3 times and, in 1995&hyphen;96, it was 8.6 times. This indicates that Telstra is continually improving its capacity to service its debt. Telstra's debt ratio was 35.5 per cent in 1993&hyphen;94 and world's best practice is 35 per cent. The debt ratio improved from 35 per cent in June 1995 to 30 per cent in June 1996&mdash;a significant improvement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard some advocates of privatisation saying that the problem with Telstra is that its debt is too low. This comes from a government which is saying that our national debt is too high, yet they are saying that Telstra is not performing well enough because its debt is too low. That is an extraordinary contradiction. We ought to congratulate Telstra for having a debt well below the average debt of similar telecommunications companies. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4305">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra's return on average equity for 1993&hyphen;94 was 18 per cent; world's best practice is over 17 per cent. It was 17.9 per cent in 1994&hyphen;95 and 1995&hyphen;96. So again that is an international measure. Telstra's credit ratings are amongst the highest of any major Australian company; this has enabled Telstra to access low cost borrowings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All in all, we have in Telstra a company that on a number of international measures is already one of the world's best. Telstra is performing at a rate that we should all be very proud of. Its contribution to national revenues is significant. In fact, I think last year Telstra's profit was bigger than the revenue we gained from the capital gains tax, and the way the profit is anticipated to grow will mean that within a few years it may well equal the revenue we get from the fringe benefits tax. So Telstra is making a major contribution to revenue whilst providing a better and better service to the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also want to point out that privatising monopolies is not without risk. Whatever people may say about a public monopoly, at least it is in public hands. For the future, even under the changes that will be made from July next year when we have a more deregulated market, Telstra will still be the dominant player in providing telecommunications services to anywhere between 85 and 90 per cent of the Australian public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even those people who came before the Senate committee arguing for privatisation said that, for the foreseeable future, Telstra will be the dominant provider of telecommunications in this country. Yet, if it is the dominant player, is it not much better to keep that dominant player in public ownership and responsible through the minister and estimates hearings to the Australian Parliament in regard to the services it is providing? Once it becomes privatised, those oversight arrangements come to an end.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra will be the biggest dominant player in our economy. We believe that is a major reason why such a dominant player should be maintained in public ownership for the benefit of ordinary Australians. Then, should they have a query about the way it is being run or <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> about its performance, or should there be issues of concern, questions can be asked of the minister in this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam Acting Deputy President, I also want to deal with the sort of telecommunications system this country will have in the future. There is no doubt that early in the next century access to broadband services will be a major issue for the social and economic equity of this country. New definitions, such as information poor and information rich, which have already come to light, will be commonly used. If you have access to broadband services you will have advantages in the way you conduct yourself and in the way you will have economic opportunities within our society. If you do not have the ability to connect with these new broadband services, you will be economically disadvantaged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With Telstra in public ownership we can ensure that all Australians will have access to a reasonable telecommunications system because, when parliament and the minister direct Telstra, it will be carried out. Once the power of direction, the power of effective oversight, by the parliament is given up, we will no longer be able to guarantee that all Australians will get the new range of services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Telstra committee of inquiry recommended, for example, that universal service obligations should be amended to guarantee, instead of it being a local phone connection on a copper pair, that it should be a bandwidth of 64 kilobits per second. That is the start for everybody to be on the information superhighway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People in regional Australia will not get this level of connection. When you ask Telstra and Optus&mdash;who are rolling out cable for broadband services in the major cities of Australia&mdash;they will tell you they have no plan to do this in Tasmania or in regional Australia. As a result, we will end up with a two&hyphen;tiered system. If you are fortunate enough to live in a socio&hyphen;economically rich suburb in Sydney or Melbourne you will probably get it; if you are unfortunate enough to live in a country town or in Hobart, Tasmania, you will be waiting a long time, whistling in the wind, to get that connection. To get that connection and service Telstra should be left <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4306"> in public ownership so that not only will its revenues pay a profit to the federal government but also so that capital works can be directed for the benefit of all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next matter I wish to raise is the issue of industry policy. Telstra is a major purchaser of equipment in Australia. It has had that policy for decades. As a result, we have many manufacturing companies in Australia which not only have supplied top quality equipment to the Telstra system in Australia, but also are now being able to compete in the world market. I think that, last financial year, exports from Australia of such equipment totalled $600 million or $700 million&mdash;a threefold increase over the previous five years. They are getting into that market because Telstra gives critical mass to purchasing in Australia. That creates lots of high quality, effective jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once you let private sector enterprise into Telstra&mdash;foreign interests, in particular overseas telcos&mdash;many of them will not want Telstra, which they are part owners of, competing with them in the new markets of Asia. It will be against their interests. As shareholders, and with directors on the board&mdash;even in a minority position&mdash;they will be able to influence an outcome. Because the minister's power of direction and influence is reduced under this bill, there will be no way to overcome it and say, `We want Telstra to be one of the major leading companies exporting services to the world and creating good quality jobs for Australians.' That is another area in which this bill is extremely deficient. It is silent about what will happen when Telstra is in private ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Though we will get some argument that we are only privatising a third, we all know that the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator Alston, spilt the beans on all this about a month ago in a television interview, which he obviously came to regret. He said, `It is not only desirable, but it is inevitable that all of Telstra will be privatised.' The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) publicly admonished him for those remarks. He publicly said that he had rung the minister twice to point out that that was not the policy of the government. The Prime Minister was getting <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> worried at the minister's inability to convince the Senate to support the privatisation and that this may upset some independent senators in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite clear that is on the agenda. Mr Costello made similar remarks overseas. He made it quite clear that if he could not get away with privatising it by legislative means, he might look it by non-legislative means. Again, this government is about full privatisation&mdash;privatisation that will lead to substantial job losses. The minister has announced at the estimates committee that he is quite happy that Telstra will get rid of 22,000 jobs over the next three years. That is a one&hyphen;third downsizing of Telstra. Telstra itself said that this will improve the profit bottom line by $600 million a year within 12 months&mdash;$600 million profit!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we have to have this downsizing under this government over the next three years, why don't we keep Telstra in public ownership so that that extra profit&mdash;which comes at the loss of 22,000 jobs&mdash;at least stays with the public; it at least goes into consolidated revenue and can be used, maybe, for education, health or, in particular, labour market reform programs for the 22,000 who have lost their jobs. Some of those 22,000 will overwhelmingly be in the rural areas of this country. The ones who will hit the fence are the service operators, the directory assistance personnel&mdash;all of which are operating very successfully in country regional centres. They are the ones who will get chopped by Telstra. That is what project Mercury said, even though it has now been denied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra is an outstanding public asset of the Australian people. We on our side accept that there always will be some faults in Telstra, that there will always be need for improvement. There always should be. We should always look at ways to improve its performance, to improve its service to its customers, to improve the quality of its jobs for its employees and, above all, to improve its profit to the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4307"> Telstra should not be bagged, as it has been, by the minister and this government, who describe it as a 600&hyphen;pound gorilla. They bag it as inefficient, saying that it is a shel tered workshop. Telstra is one of the most successful companies this country has ever seen, and it is in public ownership. It is delivering the goods for the Australian people. That is why this opposition will, in this bill, fight tooth and nail to oppose the privatisation of Telstra. We will fight it all the way through in this place, and we hope that enough senators see the commonsense view of maintaining Telstra in public ownership for the benefit of all Australians. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Madam President. I rise this afternoon, as the last new senator of the class of 1 July 1996, to make my first speech. In so doing I am conscious that our terms as senators will expire in year 2002, and that we will have had the privilege and enormous responsibility, with others, of defining and shaping Australia's direction across the dawn of the new millennium. I have listened with interest and admiration to the speeches of my colleagues and have been impressed by the diversity of perspective, talent and unique life experience which each one brings to this place. </PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have no immediate predecessor to acknowledge. In the 1996 election my seat was the only numerical change in the composition of the Senate, being a gain for the coalition. Until 1990 my seat was held by a distinguished former senator Chris Puplick, currently President of the New South Wales Anti-Discrimination Board and Chairman of the Privacy Committee. In these capacities he continues to make a significant contribution to public life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am immensely proud to represent the people of New South Wales&mdash;the premier state. In May 1788 in Sydney, New South Wales, Governor Arthur Phillip laid the foundation stone for the first Government <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> House, the seat of colonial power in the Pacific. This profoundly significant act has different meanings to different Australians. To some it marked the birthplace of a nation; to others it meant invasion. For many, it means a turning point in history and untold opportunities to build the nation together. It is an opportunity given to me by the people of New South Wales and I will not waste it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have no doubt that as the present custodians each of us wish to leave our community a better place than we found it. As I see it, the most compelling challenge facing us as a nation today is how to reconcile the need for fiscal responsibility with the provision of a meaningful and adequate safety net for the genuinely needy in an era of rapid technological and social change. To borrow the words of US economist, Arthur M. Okun from his essay `Equality and Efficiency: The Big Trade&hyphen;off', the dilemma is how `to put some rationality into equality and some humanity into efficiency'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps at no time in Australia's history has the need to balance these competing notions been so important or so compelling. To respond to this, we need to step back from the siren calls coming from simplistic feelings of fear, prejudice and misunderstanding. What Australians demand of us as legislators and what the community is entitled to have is an examination of the concept of what the community aims to be and wants to pass on to our children. In a fair society, those aims find expression in access to minimum standards of education, employment, health, housing and a decent standard of living for its citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problems that face Australia today and over the next decade are intertwined. We need to take a holistic picture of the Australian community of the future. What education do citizens need? What level of education can we afford? What jobs will be available? What will be the requirements of a physically and socially healthy community? Inappropriate solutions for education now will necessarily aggravate the problems of lack of employment opportunities and lack of employment impacts on community health. It is only by devising appropriate solutions to all these problems that we can achieve a fair society.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4308">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us start with education. Are our policies well designed to ensure that the students of today are getting an education that will best enable them to obtain employment in areas where jobs will be available? In order to ensure that we train students appropriately, it is necessary to determine the likely employment picture of the future. The future of work and how we deal with unemployment and the unemployed are critical to our vision of the future&mdash;about the place we want Australia to be. Unemployment, lack of security, declining living standards and pressure on resources profoundly affect the balance of equity and efficiency. In addition, the social cost of unemployment on families and relationships is often overlooked or hidden. It affects not only individuals but all too often third parties who are the victims of crime and drug abuse born out of hopelessness and despair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Profound shifts in employment patterns and in traditional modes of work not only impact on labour market policy but pose many questions for any forward looking job strategy. What will work mean at the close of the century? What sort of jobs will be available in the year 2020? Who will do the available work? What hours will they do it in? Will there be a physical workplace to go to? What happens to those who do not have any work? On these answers depend future strategies for appropriate education, training, employment, urban planning, infrastructure and industry policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only does Australia currently have close to one million people unsuccessfully seeking paid employment but, as well, unpublished ABS figures show that almost a quarter of those in employment work in casual jobs. One in four casual employees would undertake more work if it were available. At the other end of the spectrum, those with full-time jobs are working longer hours than ever before and those having two jobs to make ends meet have significantly increased. In his recent series in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, `Revolution in the Workplace', Stephen Long describes the great divide in the Australian workplace as `between the overworked and the out of work; between the well <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> paid and the poorly paid; between career jobs and fringe jobs'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The composition of the work force has also changed dramatically. Staying in one job for the whole of one's working life is no longer a reality. In its final report in May 1996 the Commission for the Future of Work identified the increase of women in the work force from 51 per cent to 62 per cent in the last 15 years as providing the most significant change in work force participation. The increase, however, is predominantly in part-time or casual work, which no doubt reflects the relentless need of most women to juggle work and family responsibilities as much as it reveals the type of available work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real brunt of unemployment, however, falls unequally on the young. Figures published by the commission show that almost half of unemployed people are under 30 and young people aged between 20 and 24 years of age comprise the largest group of long-term unemployed. Of most concern in sharing the burden of unemployment equitably is the long-term rise in Australian families that simply have no `breadwinner' at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A recent National Institute of Labour Studies report has predicted that the best official unemployment figure to expect by the year 2000 is 7.2 per cent. Downsizing, restructuring and outsourcing have eliminated thousands of jobs. If these trends continue, there are profound implications not only for wage policy, taxation, superannuation and welfare, but for health, education and our ability to deliver equity goals. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if it were possible to achieve a more equitable distribution of jobs by making greater efficiencies, that will only affect the pool of work currently available. To be able to provide appropriate education, employment and health care for future Australians and help for the genuinely disadvantaged, it is essential that we identify and provide opportunities for growth and the creation of new jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is right, in my view, to emphasise the importance of labour market flexibility and productivity related reforms. There is also much to be said for ways of organising the workplace, including multiskilling, job sharing, perhaps self-managing units, work units <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4309"> tied to productivity outcomes, job pools and programs to directly assist matching of skills to available jobs for the unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Concerns that deregulation of the labour market might result in increased productivity but lower wages can be met by encouraging growth of those businesses capable of creating a large volume of high wage and high satisfaction jobs. The 1996 OECD report `Technology, Productivity and Job Creation' identifies knowledge, especially technological knowledge, in industries such as telecommunications, pharmaceuticals, new materials, environmental technologies, computers, education and software as the main source of economic growth and job creation in member countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If finding better ways to do things is the source of future jobs and higher living standards, what sort of education and training will best equip the work force of the future to understand and use knowledge? One thing is certain, and that is that the better educated will have an advantage in accessing the new world of electronic commerce. This may lead to widening inequalities between the skilled and unskilled, unless ways are found to train workers in the new technologies and to remove barriers to entry to new jobs. However, there are new and exciting possibilities here to provide, for example, electronic access to teachers, trainers, libraries and programs to meet needs of those in rural and remote locations or for those who would otherwise have no access to such training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Creating new demand for new products inevitably creates the need for more highly skilled and better paid workers. One only has to consider, for example, the effect of new products such as mobile phones. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Standard and Poor's Industry Profile</EMPHASIS> predicts that the telecommunications industry, worth $19.3 billion in 1994, will reach $30 billion by the year 2004, with the mobile phone sector growing in excess of 50 per cent per annum. Mobile phones, which barely existed 20 years ago, now in Australia alone constitute a $1 billion industry with some 2.5 million subscribers. If this is the way forward in Australia for job creation, the policy implications go <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> beyond making the labour and product markets more flexible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Dr David Clark of the School of Economics, University of New South Wales, points out, job creation also depends on addressing those factors which inhibit business investment. The role for government is not only to foster conditions for emerging markets, it is also to develop and implement strategies coordinating initiatives across a wide range of relevant policy areas including business, taxation, industry, training and employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a means of job creation, Australia's trading relationship with east Asia, the fastest growing region in the world, is of critical importance. In his recent speech to the 25th Annual Conference of Economists, ANU Professor Peter Drysdale suggested that, on an international comparison, Australia is becoming less relevant in the booming Asian markets, having lost export opportunities worth $12 billion between 1985 and 1993. This cannot be allowed to continue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The need for increased competitiveness in existing and new import markets, especially in value added so&hyphen;called `elaborately transformed' manufactures and services, should not only arrest the decline but generate more high wage export manufacturing jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite Australia's welcome commitment together with APEC trading partners to reduction of tariff protection for local industry, care will be needed to ensure our own industries are not wiped out in the process. Whilst the distorting effect of subsidies through tariffs, rebates or tax breaks are well understood, when and how to cut business welfare and by how much is a difficult balancing act. The community as a whole is affected, simply because business responds by increasing prices or by reducing investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The role for government in identifying and encouraging new growth opportunities is, in my view, to promote those policies which boost productivity and to provide the settings for long&hyphen;term efficiency and equity. In <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Remaking Australia</EMPHASIS>, Professor Hugh Emy described the process thus:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Infrastructure, research, knowledge production&mdash;these are the realms of government, so there is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4310"> more scope for government to intervene to improve the resource base or provide the enabling conditions likely to attract and/or advantage globally competitive industries within its own territory.</PARA>
<PARA>A clear example is the need to provide a regulatory environment in telecommunications and the multi&hyphen;media which allows competition to deliver the very best results, while protecting community safeguards and ensuring that the fruits of such competition are widespread throughout the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To achieve an education system that prepares a motivated work force for the type and range of available work and to enlarge the pool of available work will enable an appropriate response to the problems of those who, by reason of health, age or disadvantage, require a social safety net.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Few community needs can be as compelling or deserving of our national attention than the need for access to health care at an affordable cost. We have an ageing population. Not only that, but we are living longer than our forebears and the ratio of those working to those retired will be 40 per cent in a short 35 years. Australia spends 8.6 per cent of its GDP on health services. This is expected to rise to 10 per cent by the year 2000. Unless the health system undergoes fundamental reform it will not survive in its present form. More particularly, unless the private health insurance system, which currently meets about 12 per cent of health care costs and takes some pressure of the public health system, is overhauled, it will disintegrate. The inquiry by the Productivity Commission is timely. The questions seem to be how much of this cost can be shifted equitably to those who can afford to pay and how the costs can be contained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although no measure in isolation is sufficient, the principle of community rating, with everyone paying the same premium irrespective of age or state of health, results in the young and the healthy simply opting out of health insurance, leaving only high risk users, the old and the chronically ill, as a customer base. Inevitably, premiums increase to cover the increase in claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to be much more imaginative in how private health insurance is structured and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> underwritten. Funds must be permitted to offer innovative products, such as lifetime community rating with lower premiums for those who join young and perhaps no&hyphen;claim bonuses or 100 per cent cover to eliminate the gap between benefit paid and cost to the patient. Additionally, the place of risk rated health insurance for trauma, sickness, hospital and medical gap and income cover needs to be explored rather than shut out of calculation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ultimately, the most effective measure to contain health costs is to maintain a healthy population. It requires a fundamental shift in attitude to devise strategies to keep people well, especially as they age and become consumers of health services. Maintaining good health for the ageing should be as much as an investment for the future as education is for the young.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a sense of genuine bewilderment amongst a lot of Australians that, in spite of an expenditure in the vicinity of $10.329 billion in the last decade, there has been no substantial improvement in the health, housing, education and general living conditions of Aboriginal people. This has led many to conclude that the cause is hopeless, and further expenditure at such scale is unjustified and, at a time of economic stringency, unwarranted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead, Australians should conclude that the way we have been doing it is wrong. Australia was right in concluding that the conditions of indigenous Australians were shameful and that if we were to hold up our heads and face ourselves in the mirror of our consciences we had to eradicate these conditions of shame. Obviously, that needed money. Obviously, not all the money was well spent. Why? How can we do it better?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead of giving way to strident calls of prejudice and misunderstanding, it behoves us to rectify our system for delivery of what most fair-minded Australians believe all members of the community are entitled to. Is eradication of treatable disease, provision of running water and adequate housing really too much to ask?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That indigenous Australians are less well off than other Australians is incontrovertible. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4311"> Socioeconomic indicators measuring the health, education, income and housing status of indigenous Australians paint a clear picture of systemic disadvantage. According to the 1994 survey of indigenous Australians, infant mortality rates are four times the rate of the total population whilst the life expectancy of males is 18 years less than the national figure and 20 years less for females.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Overall average income in 1994 was 30 per cent less than the $20,000 average of the total population. At the last national census, 40 per cent of indigenous Australians aged 15 and over earned less than $8,000 a year. Long-term unemployment of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people ranges between 60 per cent and 70 per cent compared with 46 per cent of all Australians unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To continue to be proud to be Australians in the year 2000, we must confront the problems of delivery of assistance. Reconciliation will follow, in my view, as a matter of course. It may be unrealistic to expect, at least in the short term, that indigenous Australians will be able to create a sustainable wealth base from running cattle stations or other commercial or community business ventures. Certainly, there are outstanding examples of Aboriginal people's involvement in successful commercial ventures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will be important to long-term relations between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians that incentives are given to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to make self-determination work so that they may better help themselves. Far more important than attributing blame is the need to reassess our priorities. We all have a stake in the outcome, and in the end we are all accountable as Australians, whatever our race or origin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The call against immigration is another manifestation of our loss of national purpose. Contrast the conditions today with the economic and social conditions which obtained at times of strong migrant inflow. Historically, Australia has been a great migrant nation greatly advantaged by the intake  of skill, labour and social diversity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One could go back to the days of the gold rushes or Queensland canegrowing, but, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> rather, look at the more recent past. In the 1950s, migration gave us the mighty Snowy Mountains scheme. There was a great need in those days for hundreds of thousands of unskilled workers, and a great number of such people were anxious to come to this country. The large number of new arrivals in the 1960s and 1970s were seen as meeting an important economic need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Conditions have changed and our migrant intake needs to reflect this. At a time when there is already serious unemployment in Australia, bringing in more unskilled workers can cause resentment. Even in skilled areas&mdash;for example, doctors&mdash;there are arguments against unconditional migration. We must first look after our own. Yet doctors are an example of an unfulfilled need. There is still a great need for doctors in rural areas which Australian graduates to date seem reluctant or unable to meet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead of erecting a mindless Fortress Australia against newcomers, we should look to a pattern of migration which, as it did in the past, advances properly thought out national goals. Opposition to immigration is in part a reflection of the deep malaise and anxiety felt by many Australians. Until more wealth is created and there are more jobs on offer, tightening family reunion requirements and expanding skilled business migration makes sense. It is difficult to see how newly arrived migrants can be expected to share the values, goals and aspirations of Australians if in coming here they remain dispossessed, poor and on the margins of society. Little wonder there has been a decline in public confidence about immigration and the value of multiculturalism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4312"> The question, however, remains as to what level of immigration is in the national interest. Our population is unlikely to grow sufficiently without immigration to take advantage of the opportunities made possible by our proximity to the south-east Asian region, nor will it be conducive to maintaining our national integrity. Fortress Australia is a mentality we cannot let prevail for long. There is a pattern of non-discriminatory migration which will serve the national interest and receive com munity support. Getting the balance right must be a national priority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I enter political life laterally, so to speak, against the background of a professional career in law spanning over 20 years. Practice of many facets of law in Australia and in the United States has given me some insight into the human condition. It has heightened my awareness of the need to guard against injustice. It has strengthened my resolve to be a voice for the oppressed. The law can be a powerful instrument for social and political change. It is the machinery which maintains and regulates legal relationships and social activity in a free and democratic society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It remains an abiding concern that many Australians cannot afford access to justice. The Attorney-General (Mr Williams) has referred to the Australian Law Reform Commission the question of changes to the adversarial system of litigation and alternative dispute resolution. The problems of delay, technicality and expense are well known and clear. The need to find a solution to provide the Australian community with an affordable and efficient dispute resolution system is yet another manifestation of a fair and just society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am grateful to those in the Liberal Party of New South Wales who saw in me a candidate worth fostering&mdash;one who would continue the great traditions of Liberal senators from New South Wales. I mention my friend Peter Collins, Leader of the Opposition in New South Wales, who for many years encouraged my interest; Rosemary Foot, former Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the first woman in New South Wales to hold that office, who started me on my journey; and Jessie Bartos, who helped along the way. I also acknowledge Chris McDiven, President of the Liberal Women's Council, who has excelled at identifying and encouraging women political candidates from all walks of life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am grateful to have the love and support of my family and friends, some of whom have travelled to be here. I especially acknowledge my father, Bill Lloyd, now in his 85th year, here with me today; my late mother, Mary Lloyd, who would have loved to be <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> here; my husband, mentor and friend, Andrew Rogers, who has so generously encouraged my personal aspirations; and my son, Adam, who is my inspiration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am immensely proud to be one of the 26 coalition women in the federal parliament and to be part of the march to government on 2 March 1996, which gave expression to the Liberal Party's commitment to the advancement of women into parliament. I am also proud to take my place alongside the women representatives from other parties. Together we now constitute 20 per cent of the national parliament&mdash;an historic first. Never before has the national parliament been as representative of the people it serves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If that is the sort of society we want Australia to be, we need to confront the choices which will deliver equality and efficiency. This is not an improbable mix of the practical and the visionary. It is about democratic values, opportunity, progress and the relentless search of the human spirit to do better. Oscar Wilde described it thus:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A map of the world that does not include Utopia is not worth even glancing at, for it leaves out the one country at which Humanity is always landing.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, can I be the first publicly to congratulate Senator Coonan on her first speech in the parliament.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4313">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate is debating the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill 1996 which provides for up to one&hyphen;third reduction of Commonwealth equity in the Telstra corporation. The bill is a manifestation of the major coalition promise to the Australian people when it was so overwhelmingly elected in March of this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The National and Liberal parties were elected to do something about government debt. We were elected to do something about the environment. The partial sale of Telstra does both by providing an estimated $7 billion to reduce public debt and interest, and over $1 billion to fund a natural heritage trust program for the environment and sustainable agriculture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This Telstra bill has been carefully designed to restrict ownership and to entrench community service obligations. It facilitates direct ownership by Australian citizens in the country's third largest company in turnover. It fosters a competitive presence in the international telecommunications market as the world embraces the information age.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra is the only one of the world's top 20 telecommunication companies yet to proceed with privatisation. The UK, New Zealand, Canada, Japan, Malaysia, Indonesia, Argentina, Germany and France&mdash;the communications minister even adds Albania&mdash;have all privatised their carriers in whole or in part or are scheduled to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition's approach to the issue of the part&hyphen;privatisation of Telstra has been one of `do what I say but not what I do'. The Commonwealth Bank, the Federal Airports Corporation and Qantas are all examples of Labor's privatisation program. The electorate knows that the tears being cried by Labor over part&hyphen;privatisation of Telstra are nothing but crocodile tears and a sham. During the debate on the Commonwealth Bank Sale Bill last year, former Senator Wheelwright stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think what the government is doing in selling the Commonwealth Bank now is redeploying in a responsible way Commonwealth funds&mdash;some $4.5 billion, if current share price values hold up&mdash;to reduce its borrowings and to maintain a sound fiscal policy. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>If he was right then, he is wrong now. As Australians have had a chance to share directly in the ownership of these institutions, why not also Telstra? These are the holes in the opposition by Labor and the Australian Democrats to the part&hyphen;privatisation of Telstra&mdash;so many holes that the opposition ship is sinking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of my constituents in Queensland are concerned about the excess of foreign ownership in large chunks of Australia's backyard. I take this opportunity to tell them of the provisions in this bill which prevent that scenario occurring with Telstra and which make sure that it remains Australian owned and controlled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part 2A sets out restrictions on foreign ownership of equity in Telstra. It will be unacceptable for foreign ownership to exceed 11.6 or 35 per cent of the partial sale. It will be unacceptable for one or more foreign person to take hold of more than a 1.6 stake in Telstra, which relates to five per cent of the equity on offer in the one&hyphen;third sale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A foreign person is defined to mean a foreign citizen not ordinarily resident in Australia; a company in which any individual foreign person or company holds more than a 15 per cent stake; a company in which an ownership stake of 40 per cent or more is held by two or more foreign persons or companies; or a trustee of a trust estate in which foreign persons hold a substantial interest. Telstra's head office remains Australian; Telstra's chairperson and a majority of its directors must be Australian citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If an unacceptable foreign ownership situation comes to exist, the Federal Court, on application from the minister, may make appropriate orders to stop it, including ordering the disposal of shares. So even with foreign ownership at the maximum level available under this legislation, Telstra will remain over 88 per cent Australian owned. There are even special incentives for individual Australians and Telstra employees to invest in their company, to personally share ownership in Australia's flagship telecommunications corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regional Australia will want to know that their interests are being secured by the part&hyphen; <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4314">privatisation of Telstra, that any change in ownership will not affect their access to telecommunications services. This bill ensures in a number of ways that rural Australians will not be disadvantaged. Firstly, part 2C reaffirms the universal service obligations that already apply to Telstra and other telecommunications carriers under the Telecommunications Act. The universal service obligation requires a standard telephone service to be offered to all Australians. The untimed local call obligation already guaranteed will be retained for residential consumers. Price capping will continue to apply and general price surveillance will apply to other industry players.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On top of this, there are three newcomer safeguards. One is the extension to business of the statutory obligation to provide the option of untimed local calls. This has not been the law until now. The others are the customer service guarantee and the extension of Austel's power to make indicative performance standards. In the place of a voluntary connection and repair guarantee, the new customer service guarantee will be a legislated and mandatory requirement to apply to all carriers, backed up by stiffer penalties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Austel will have the power to determine performance standards in relation to the period taken to comply with the request for connecting and rectifying faults, and the keeping of appointments to meet customers for these purposes. Carriers will have to meet the standards and the statutory requirements or face an Austel determined scale of damages. Austel will report annually on how the carriers discharge their obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Austel's existing power to develop indicative performance standards will also be widened to impose requirements on the industry in relation to most other billing matters. These include requirements to comply with Austel's specific billing standards to ensure timely, accurate and comprehensive financial information. There is a requirement for Austel to set up procedures for the generation of standard billing reports to be made available to customers on request, enabling independent analysis and audit of telecommunication bills. As a minority Senate com mittee report found, the Telstra bill will not in any way affect the legislative and other protection of directory assistance, timed local calls and the provision of public telephones, all of which will remain unaffected by this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The customer service guarantee and related provisions actually increase Telstra's accountability to and scrutiny by the public while, at the same time, Telstra will still have to report to parliament. The majority report from Labor and, I might add, the Australian Democrats, was illuminating. They found so many faults with the way Telstra is currently operating, it is a wonder they did not do something about it when they were in government. It is a case of selective amnesia with Labor senators forgetting the principles which guided their own privatisation effort.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was particularly struck by the way Labor and Democrat senators used the committee as an exercise to say that, far from selling part of Telstra, we should be giving it more money. Recommendation 13 of the majority report says that the committee recommends Telstra's operation be resourced up to a level which allows ongoing improvements in customer service quality. You have to ask: where is the money going to come from? Perhaps the answer is that we should borrow some more. Maybe Senator Kernot and her merry band of Democrats could allow us to take it out of the environmental vote. It is ludicrous when we are trying to restore some fiscal balance and alleviate government borrowings and interest repayments, as well as making massive investments in the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition is suggesting that government find more money to resource Telstra. Then, in a bizarre twist, they also want to charge Telstra a levy. It is in recommendation 35. On the one hand, Telstra should be resourced up. On the other hand, it should be levied down. They propose so many regulations and qualifiers which would straightjacket the enterprising activities needed to ensure Telstra's survival. The partial privatisation will enable Telstra to increase its flexibility in response to market demands in what is a rapidly changing environment.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4315">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to ask whether we would put lead in the shoes of a runner, but that is exactly what the Labor Party and the Democrats are advocating. The public benefit is not served by restraining full public ownership of Telstra. The public benefit is not served by ploughing more government funds into Telstra. The public benefit is not served by rejecting an opportunity to reduce colossal debt and restore the environment. Senator Meg Lees complains the government is being driven by economic fashion. I say to Senator Lees: if helping the environment and reducing debt while, at the same time, legislating for customer service guarantees is economically fashionable, then let's be in it. We want an Australian controlled Telstra out on the international catwalk parading Australia's competitiveness and winning market share. The Democrats and Labor would hide Telstra backstage and not allow it to present itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Acting Deputy President, like many of us, you have probably seen the Telstra advertisement on television where a girl comes out and says, `My wish is for an everlasting packet of Tim Tams.' That is how the Democrats want to run this country&mdash;wishing for an everlasting supply of money. If someone provides it, the Democrats will be neither the government nor the opposition, yet they will sit on the crossbenches and tell all of us how it should be done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to find money for public debt reduction and environmental programs. Money does not grow on trees. We have to do what we can with what we have. The Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill presents Australia with several opportunities for doing exactly that: $7 billion to reduce the debt burden of future Australians inflicted by a reckless past government; $1 billion to put the environment and sustainable agriculture on the pedestal it deserves; and the opportunity, via private ownership, to give Telstra what it needs to compete in a competitive communication information age for the benefit of all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I plead with the Democrats and senators on the other side to show concern for the environment. They should note that, over the next five years, this bill will fund five capital <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> projects: the national vegetation initiative; the Murray&hyphen;Darling 2001 project; the national reserve system; the national land and water resources audit; and the coast and clean seas initiative&mdash;all initiatives that I should have thought the Democrats would have been in on with their ears back. But they are bogged down on some illogical concern and, although the basis of their party is concern for the environment, they do not appear the least bit interested in it. The only logical response is to get on with this bill and get it over with.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Telstra and its future role is important for all Australians, but especially so for those living away from the metropolitan areas. Communication is the essential equaliser between regional Australia and the more populated areas. In Europe and Asia, where population density is higher than here, regional development is facilitated and encouraged by superior communications that are at least equal to the larger towns and cities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the south&hyphen;west of England there is hardly an empty farm shed that has not been gutted and therefore allowed some small business armed with an on&hyphen;line computer, fax, phone, e&hyphen;mail and Internet to carve out a business where communications is the key and the physical position of the operation is largely irrelevant. The situation is essentially the same in Australia. Because our country is so geographically enormous there is difficulty in providing communication services, the high costs of spreading a network, the diversity of our agricultural and regional businesses, the low density of population in some areas and the increasing number of companies that are in the information and communications industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the quality of telecommunications in and to non&hyphen;metropolitan areas improves, there is scope for the creation, not the reduction of jobs. Tele&hyphen;industries are increasingly important employers in businesses like airlines, hotels, car rental reservation centres, the telephone inquiry centres for banks and other financial institutions, catalogue sale order and service centres and so on. The Senate inquiry <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4316"> heard evidence that in the United States there is an increasing trend to site such businesses outside the big cities to take advantage of lower costs and a large pool of high quality, motivated potential employees&mdash;and the same is certainly the case in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has already insisted on a dramatic speed&hyphen;up of the availability of state&hyphen;of&hyphen;the&hyphen;art communication services to the bush. Telstra has recently announced the acceleration of the national telecommunication exchange network to digital standard&mdash;the ISDN. This will be completed by 1998 and will cover over 97 per cent of the population. Telstra has said it will be upgrading the network at the same rate in both country and metropolitan areas. So city and country exchanges will be 85 per cent digital by December 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a first for country areas because regional Australia normally lags behind, which is hardly surprising, especially in view of the communication explosion that we have seen over the last 10 years or so and the fact that the previous government had little understanding of regional areas. Telstra is to be congratulated on providing these facilities which will allow for educational, cultural and information services, for much faster faxes, fast access to Internet, interactive multi&hyphen;media functions such as video conferencing, faster and more reliable transmission with modern circuits, quicker dial&hyphen;up times and better signal quality, small screen video conferencing, fast EFTPOS links, and much more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's decision to expedite this modernisation program will mean between 500,000 and 750,000 people who presently have substandard lines around the bush will begin to have state&hyphen;of&hyphen;the&hyphen;art communication. The technological breakthrough will mean both business and domestic phone users will have access to the wide range of enhanced services that I have already mentioned. This is great news for people who live in regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> In a recent report by the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation, the significant demand for the delivery of on&hyphen;line services for regional Australia was highlighted. The report confirmed that remote commu nities and farm businesses stand to benefit significantly from the world's growing information sector. Dr Buckeridge, the author of this report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rural Australia Online</EMPHASIS>, identified three main constraints on the delivery of service. They were: inadequate technical capacity of existing telecommunications infrastructure; high telecommunications prices; and restricted access to education, training and user support services. Dr Buckeridge says that Telstra will have to play a major part in the effective delivery of these services as it is by far the dominant owner and current builder of the telephone and data networks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, Telstra's investment strategies will have to satisfy the needs of remote areas. The government's commitment has already been shown to a large extent with the ISDN proposed investment, which has been expedited by the present Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator Alston. A continued commitment will be necessary from Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In June, the National Farmers Federation conducted a survey to gauge farmers' opinion on the partial sale of Telstra. The survey had 860 respondents, of which 66 per cent supported the proposal. In addition, the survey shows that a majority of 73 per cent believe that the partial sale should fund the proposed environmental package. The funding of the Natural Heritage Trust, in addition to the substantial funds allocated in this year's budget, will be very beneficial to all Australians, not just farmers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those who responded to the NFF survey made it clear, however, that they want existing benefits, namely, the universal service obligation and no timed local calls, maintained. The proposed legislation guarantees that where services are uneconomic the present cross&hyphen;subsidisation will be maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4317"> The new government has already shown itself keen to address regional Australia's telecommunications needs, quite apart from the proposed partial sale of Telstra. I would like to mention three initiatives. The first was the July announcement of the review of the standard telephone service. This review will focus on whether the current standard telephone service is adequate or should be up graded to accommodate new technologies such as fax and data transmissions and mobile phones, along with the cost implications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current definition of the universal service obligation within the Telecommunications Act 1991 provides for a minimum voice grade telephone service to be reasonably accessible to all Australians, wherever they live or wherever they carry on a business. However, there have been significant advances in technology since that legislation was passed and the community's expectations of access and availability have grown as a result. This review will clearly amend our understanding of what amounts to a standard telephone service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second initiative was the July announcement by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, John Sharp, who launched the farmwide online services project. This is a trial project giving 1,000 people living in rural and remote areas cheap on&hyphen;line services and Internet for $5 per hour and for the cost of a local call. This is a joint project of the NFF, the Department of Transport and Regional Development, Telstra, Microsoft and IBM. It is another initiative to provide people in rural and regional areas with access to information equivalent to that of their city counterparts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third initiative was Senator Alston's announcement in which he recently reassured rural mobile phone users that they will not be disadvantaged when the network is converted from analog to digital by December 1999. There is no doubt that at the moment the current analog network is superior to the digital network. It has a wider reach and it does not suddenly drop out, as is the case with some digital services. Senator Alston has said the government will ensure that the draft telecommunications bill will have a safety net for rural mobile phone users after the network is converted from analog to digital. This will preserve the mobile phone service of at least 3,000 mobile phone users who will lack digital coverage at the time of the phase&hyphen;out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regional Australia has much to benefit from this government and will continue to do so with the collateral partial sale of Telstra. Appearing before the Senate Telstra inquiry, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the National Farmers Federation supported the sale, with the President, Mr McGauchie, saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the market in telecommunications is maturing and further competition and regulatory changes are needed to keep up the momentum to keep pace with our international and domestic competition . . . the partial privatisation of Telstra will better place it to respond to that change.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the farming community have had to bear the cost of, in many respects, inefficiencies in services provided in that way in the past.</PARA>
<PARA>He further said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Telstra has identified some of the key benefits of partial privatisation as a faster response to market trends, exposure to the discipline of continuous performance assessment by the financial markets and commercially based access to resources, including capital.</PARA>
<PARA>I certainly agree with him. Interestingly enough, so do a number of people on the other side, including the present Leader of the Opposition, Mr Kim Beazley. When speaking at the National Press Club in August 1994, he is quoted as having said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The primary objective driving the privatisation program is to make Australia an efficient, internationally competitive economy&mdash;and that means introducing competition into our enterprises and into our market sectors.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Beazley went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The real measure for whether privatisation should occur is whether there will be a net social and economic gain from moving a particular enterprise into private ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The "net gain" can take many forms: potentially better services and lower prices for consumers; stronger enterprises and greater competition for our economy; and, in the broader sense, making government funds available for new policy.</PARA>
<PARA>I repeat that: making government funds available for new policy. This particular privatisation will provide additional funds for the environment. The environmental benefits of the sale should be particularly highlighted. The commitment to transfer $1 billion to the Natural Heritage Trust is the most comprehensive environmental package ever proposed by government. It is in addition to existing spending commitments in the budget on the environment. The money invested in the Natural Heritage Trust will be devoted entire <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4318"> ly to capital projects to maintain and replenish Australia's environmental infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The five capital projects to be funded from the money invested in the Natural Heritage Trust are: a national vegetation initiative; the Murray-Darling rehabilitation; a national land and water resources system; a comprehensive national reserve system; and a coasts and clean seas initiative. All interest earned from the trust will be devoted to recurrent expenditure on environmental projects and the further development of sustainable agriculture. Some of these projects include: additional funding for the Landcare project; a national river care program; a cleaner air program to address air pollution; and a national weed strategy. At the end of the five-year program, over $300 million will remain in perpetuity in the trust. All interest earned on the capital held in the trust will be devoted to environmental projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In establishing the Natural Heritage Trust, the government is providing a certainty of funding over a long period of time that will be free of normal economic and budgetary constraints which all governments inevitably face. The trust will provide a commitment to the environment which is certainly preferable to a recurrent funding approach. We need look no further than the massive $10 billion debt that the government inherited from the now opposition. The budget has already made inroads into addressing that deficit, but to fund the much needed environmental programs from recurrent expenditure would require savings of a further $1 billion over the next five years. This would simply be too difficult for us to absorb at this time. Any alternative approach to the partial sale of Telstra and the simultaneous establishment of the Natural Heritage Trust would come at an extreme cost to either the environment or our national economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To conclude, the partial sale of Telstra will expose it to the scrutiny of the market place, which will contribute to making it a more dynamic company, both domestically and globally. This will allow Telstra to operate on a commercial basis, rather than be forced to fulfil the ever changing political objectives of the government of the day.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I reaffirm the safeguards that have been written into the legislation: to ensure that Telstra abides by its customer service obligations to provide rural and regional Australia with a fair and equitable service; that untimed local telephone calls are provided to both residential and business customers; that existing price caps will remain to ensure lower telephone prices; that the minimum service standards are maintained through a customer services guarantee; and that the maximum allowable level of foreign ownership will be less than 12 per cent. Further, the chairman will be an Australian, the board will be comprised of a majority of Australians, and Telstra's corporate headquarters will remain in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clear that the partial sale will deliver significant economic, service and environmental benefits to Australians. These same Australians expect the government to implement the policies announced prior to our election. The people of Australia overwhelmingly supported the coalition's policy package at the last election, a package which included responsible management of the nation's finances and the strongest possible commitment to the environment in our history. Let us get on with the job with this sale.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me commence my contribution to the debate on the second reading of the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill 1996 by indicating that this bill gives effect to the government's blackmail policy of flogging off our national communications carrier, Telstra, to pay for environment funding through the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia, as announced by the coalition during the election campaign this year. The Labor Party, for its part, is committed to a 100 per cent government owned national communications carrier. We took that commitment to the last election. That has been a longstanding platform commitment of the Australian Labor Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We really made our position on this crystal clear during the last election campaign when the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, said on 23 January this year: `Telstra is simply not for sale.' Unlike the government, this rabble over here with their core and non-core promises and commitments, we are going to stick resolutely by that commitment that our leader made during the election campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we all know, this legislation is not just about selling Telstra; it is also about holding environment funding in this country hostage to the sale of Telstra. We on this side of the chamber have always opposed and stand opposed to that sort of political thuggery. I believe that selling part or all of our national communications carrier&mdash;Telstra&mdash;worth some $24 billion, would be an act of gross irresponsibility in itself. For the government to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> claim that it will be a more competitive company after privatisation is just arrant nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra has been corporatised, and it is already competing very successfully on the international market. It is fair to say that Telstra is a very strong, very vibrant company which achieved record profits of $3 billion in 1994-95. It is aggressively seeking and claiming new markets in Asia. Its value has increased from $18 billion when John Hewson wanted to sell it&mdash;remember him?&mdash;to around $24 billion now. It has employed an extra 11,000 people since 1993. We believe that, inevitably, a partial sale of Telstra would lead to its complete privatisation under a coalition government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has found it very hard to hide his intentions on this particular matter, while the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator Alston, has not even bothered to try; neither did the Treasurer, Mr Costello, on his gaffe riddled trip to the United States of America. During the election campaign, Mr Howard promised that a third of the company would be sold in this term of government. That was his promise. But he never denied, nor did he at any stage rule out, that all the $24 billion resource would be flogged off in the longer term, including to non-Australian interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition's true agenda has been more recently accidentally revealed by Senator Alston. When questioned on Channel 10's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meet the Press</EMPHASIS> program on Sunday, 1 September, whether the eventual total sale of Telstra was inevitable and preferable, he responded in this way:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Indeed it is, Michelle. It is not only inevitable but it is highly desirable.</PARA>
<PARA>He was asked further whether he anticipated going to the next election with a platform which says, `We will sell the rest of Telstra,' to which he responded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That's quite a possibility. It depends on whether we get this Bill through, how it beds down, what we judge the community reaction to be. But if you were asking me in principle, do I have any objection to going further, the answer is clearly no.</PARA>
<PARA>After Senator Alston let the cat out of the bag, the Prime Minister was left to try to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4320"> cover up and repair the damage that was caused by Senator Alston's unfortunate and untimely gaffe&mdash;his revelation. This is something, I suppose, that the Prime Minister has become pretty expert in, given the number of gaffes that he has had to cover up for with his front bench. This was John Howard's pathetic defence on this issue:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the government has not taken any decision to sell off the whole of Telstra. The only decision that the Government has taken is the policy that we took to the last election. . . . The only policy commitment we have is a commitment to sell one-third and I said during the election campaign and I repeat it, and nothing has changed, I want to make this very clear, that if there were any intention to go any further that would be the subject of an explicit policy at a subsequent election.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>They were Mr Howard's own words. He can try and sleaze out of this with weasel words any way he likes, but he can never hide or cover up the ideological obsession that this government has with privatisation for privatisation's sake.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government cannot be trusted on this issue. They are trying to con this Senate and the Australian people into selling off part of one national asset to save another. No&hyphen;one should for one minute believe these weasel words about not selling more than one&hyphen;third of Telstra during this term of government. They will not settle for one&hyphen;third of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might say that they have failed to provide any good reason for the partial privatisation of Telstra. Their only defence has been one that the opposition finds thoroughly objectionable. The government's approach of making environment policy in this country some kind of bait or trade&hyphen;off for the Senate agreeing to the sale of Telstra is an insult to all of us.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Fischer, the Deputy Prime Minister, who has been subject to a lot of interesting parliamentary questioning just today about another issue, said on radio station 2CS on 2 <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> February 1996&mdash;let me quote the eloquent and articulate words of Mr Fischer&mdash;that the link was merely a `ploy to captivate a Senate vote'. That really says it all. He was being very honest on that occasion. We may not have heard the whole truth about the BHP shares and conflict of interest, but I am sure he was being very frank when he said that the Telstra&hyphen;environment link was a ploy to captivate a Senate vote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that the coalition's Telstra environment policy was a sham. It was always a sham to con and blackmail the Senate into being part of the coalition's privatisation agenda. If the coalition were really serious about the environment, they would fund the environment off the budget, as we did in government and as we always will when we are returned to government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe that the coalition's Natural Heritage Trust is an unworthy objective. I think it is a worthy enough objective. But it has to be funded without resorting to political blackmail and Thatcherite funding mechanisms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind the Senate that the initiatives and policies that are to be funded by the trust&mdash;the land and water degradation programs, the rehabilitation of the Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin, national river care, the coasts and clean seas initiative and the national reserves cooperative program&mdash;are all essentially Labor's policies. They were stolen by the coalition for electoral reasons. The policies were ours, but the lack of commitment to those policies was uniquely yours. It was unique to the coalition. When it comes to the hard question of economic interest versus environmental protection, the coalition's true colours always shine through. They do not believe, and never have, in the protection of the environment. If they did, we would have had an environmental policy implemented well before now. John Howard showed his true colours in April 1992 when he said that Australia's economic progress was being held up by excessive concern for the environment and that this position was exacerbated by skewed media coverage of ecological issues.</PARA>

I recently mentioned to the Senate the absolutely pathetic record of the Howard government's environment policy, a government whose environment credentials are already in tatters after just seven months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have an environment minister in office who shows no interest in the environment, no willingness to take up the cudgels to protect the environment. His record speaks for itself. He has been involved in a massive increase in the amount of woodchips to be exported from Australia. He did not stand up to you, Senator Parer, when he attempted to abolish export control powers for minerals. He has been perfectly happy to give state governments veto powers over listing of World Heritage, and more than happy to support you, Senator Parer, in expanding uranium mining in Australia. He has done nothing&mdash;along with you, Senator Parer&mdash;in progressing the government's response to the greenhouse effect. He has been absolutely negligent in his responsibilities in giving the green light to the Port Hinchinbrook development in North Queensland and he has presided over a cut in the environment department's budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What a miserable, pathetic, disgusting record for a minister after only seven months in office. After just seven months in office he has basically abrogated all responsibility on the environment and handed it willy&hyphen;nilly to Senator Parer, the resources minister. The Telstra&hyphen;environment link is a shabby link that has been concocted by this government to capture the support of the minor parties in this place. As I have indicated before, the dry agenda far outweighs the wet. I think the coalition failed in this shabby trick. It failed in the election campaign to convince the majority of Australians that this was a reasonable proposal. I have said before in this place that, without doubt, this was the biggest single negative that the coalition had in its election campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government hoodwinked the people. You were exposed during the election campaign because Australians were able to see <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that clearly a majority of the Senate did not support the partial privatisation of Telstra. Your commitment to the environment stood exposed as nothing more than mere rhetoric. We in the Labor Party made our level of commitment to the environment very clear. We have always believed the environment in this country should be supported with adequate funding and no strings attached.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We actually happen to believe that the environment and its protection is a vital issue in its own right. We had a tremendous record in government. Without strings or blackmail we were able to achieve an enormous amount in terms of the protection of the environment in this country. The Labor government had those achievements in environmental policy without any strings attached. We never resorted to the sort of blackmail that we have seen from the coalition. There was never any blackmail to flog one national asset to save another.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor does not accept that the government has an unfettered mandate to sell Telstra. During the election campaign we made our position on this issue clear. As the former environment minister I well remember the day the coalition announced its policy on the environment in the Dandenong Ranges. The policy was clear&mdash;it was the part&hyphen;privatisation of Telstra with a link to the environment. One hour after that policy became public I tagged it, quite rightly, the `Telstra environment policy'. We indicated that we would not vote for the partial sale of Telstra in this place regardless of the outcome of the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We said that from the time the government announced its policy. We have not wavered. We will not waver on this issue. We gave a commitment to the Australian people, who voted for Labor in the House of Representatives and the Senate, that we would do everything in our power to maintain Telstra in public ownership. We will honour that commitment. I assure those who voted for us that we will keep that commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a very important piece of legislation. I do not think that the Australian community has any confidence in or derives any reassurance from any commitment from this government, which has indicated that it stands for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4322"> nothing more or less than a capacity to break the election promises and commitments that it has made.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I remind the Senate that Oscar Wilde remarked 100 years ago that the cynic knew the price of everything but the value of nothing. This is a government driven by economic rationalists who are the ultimate cynics when it comes to social policy and national development. While even these cynics might have some difficulty agreeing on the price of Telstra, Oscar Wilde's observation as to its value is remarkably apt. As far as Labor is concerned, Telstra is far too valuable to ever sell.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has sought to bribe and blackmail the Australian conservation movement and others concerned about  Australia's environment by suggesting that we should accept ill-defined and illusionary short&hyphen;term financial benefits from the sale of Telstra which themselves are overshadowed by the massive disadvantages to the Australian people and national development at large. It is important to ask: what is it that builds a nation? Nearly 100 years ago our federation came into being. It was just at the time Oscar Wilde was making his comments. Federation meant that all Australian citizens could be represented in one place and at one time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is in the last few years that the mainland states of this nation were linked by a common railway. The previous railway system was a blight on our landscape and was a historical monument to our isolation and separatism. One of the first and most significant means of bringing this country and its citizens together was our telephone and postal services. The telephone network became the lifeline and the means by which Australians right across the country could keep in touch, could develop business links and could run public administration properly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The telecommunications industry that was built around the telephonic network has brought economic growth and thousands of jobs across this country. Labor's opposition to the sale of Telstra is based upon our recognition of the fundamental place that this <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> service provider and employer has in our history and reflects the recent and substantial community disquiet about the government's privatisation plan. It fundamentally recognises the critical importance of Telstra to our economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is based on a firm conviction that the government's claims about the benefits of the sale offered to the nation are illusory. Many will argue that the short-term budgetary implications for this sale would be of huge political benefit to the government. As far as I am concerned, the budgetary gains will be overshadowed by the long-term disadvantages that must attend the loss of such a profitable and strategically significant public asset. I say the `loss' of the asset because Senator Alston, I think, has made his point very clearly, and no-one in this chamber should be under any illusion about the real issues that we face today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Should this Senate endorse the process of the sale of one-third of Telstra, we will see ultimately the full privatisation of Telstra. As far as Labor is concerned, this country should not embark upon that course. Our resolve has only been strengthened by the evidence against privatisation presented to this parliament via its committee, that is, the inquiry into Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen that the case for privatisation is based essentially on rhetorical and ideological arguments rather than on any empirical evidence. Telstra is a highly successful company and its record $2.3 billion profit for this year clearly indicates that. Its financial performance is equal to that of its international peers. At the same time, it provides a unique service. Despite the difficulties presented by Australia's geography and its demography, Australian society has one of the highest levels of telephone access in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra has played an important role in nation building through the provision of affordable communications services on a universal basis. It has pioneered research and development of international importance and has been a leader in the introduction of technologies such as ISDN and fibre optics. It has played a critical part in the growth of the Australian electronics industry. At the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4323"> same time, as well as being one of the country's largest employers, it has provided job opportunities throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Its recent record $2.3 billion profit is sure to grow in future years. The industry is growing at 15 per cent per annum. New investment is set to grow at 22 per cent per annum, sales by 20 per cent per annum and exports at 38 per cent per annum. That, to me, indicates the value of Telstra to the Australian economy and it should not be diverted from the 100 per cent Australian ownership that it currently has. One hundred per cent of Australians currently own Telstra and currently enjoy the benefit of that public ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's main rationale for the sale&mdash;supposed private sector efficiency gains&mdash;clearly fail the test of public scrutiny, and that was clearly demonstrated by the Senate committee. Of the 650 submissions received and 135 witnesses examined, the only real supporters of the sale were government departments acting on the instructions of their political masters; the senior management of Telstra, who stand to gain substantial remuneration increases under a privatised regime; and, of course, government agencies who are under direct political control.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The main argument presented in evidence to the committee was based on a World Bank study which looked at some 6,800 cases. But there were no comparisons with telecommunications companies of equal value or equal profitability to Telstra, no companies that compare with Australia's regulatory framework and no country&mdash;even on an international basis&mdash;that compares with Australia's demography or geography. After failing to justify the validity of the international studies that had been so heavily cited by the government, the only argument that those supporting privatisation can muster is a mystical and unsupported belief in the power of the market itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The undermining of consumer interests&mdash;especially in rural communities&mdash;that this market power will cause has been ignored by this government in its unrestrained drive to reach the magical world best practice benchmark. The debate about the power of the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> marker appears to unleash the cowboys of the corporate and political worlds who would follow the unrestrained doctrine of the far Right. In simplistic terms, public ownership, according to this view, is bad and private wealth is good. The private sector is good. This is an ideological belief that has to do more with the political assumptions of this government than with any sound basis in fact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ramifications of the sale are very clear. Mr Costello, Mr Howard and Senator Alston have clearly indicated that this government is committed to pursuing the full privatisation of Telstra. We have a situation where, despite the fact that legislation has just come in before the parliament, privatisation is already the driving force within the operations of Telstra itself. This is particularly the case when one looks at the areas of the current round of redundancies being pursued by the Telstra management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite Telstra's desire to reveal only minimal details before the Senate committee, the Senate inquiry was able to clearly identify that project Mercury was operating in such a way as to remove one-third of the company&mdash;to remove one-third of the work force within Telstra&mdash;and that it was an internal program initiated by the Telstra management in April 1996 to prepare Telstra for privatisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Its objective was to identify areas where cost savings could be achieved, largely through staff reductions. The project Mercury documents clearly reveal that this was where the massive job losses would occur as a result of the sale or outsourcing of so-called non&hyphen;value added or non&hyphen;core businesses within the company. You do not have to be particularly smart to understand that the aim of project Mercury was to prepare Telstra for privatisation itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under this plan, Telstra is to be gutted for the marketplace. It is to be trimmed of its capacity to support Australian technological industry, cured of any sense of community service obligation and packaged for potential investors. The restructuring of Telstra for privatisation comes at considerable costs to consumers, to Telstra workers and to regional communities that benefit substantially from the current industrial practices and the current <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4324"> service delivery of Telstra. We see that no more clearly than in the subsidised service that Telstra currently provides.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the international experience of privatisation. Job losses are the most significant common theme of all the international privatisations of telecommunications companies. In the case of Telecom New Zealand, staffing levels declined from 24,500 in 1987, at the time of corporatisation, to 16,000 in 1990, at the time of the privatisation. Now they are down to a mere 8,568. Telstra has already announced job cuts of 9,000 this financial year. Well over fifty per cent of those are coming from the consumer and commercial divisions, which are responsible for network maintenance and installation. The project Mercury process has been followed through to the board level to the stage now where the removal of some 23,000 jobs has been announced&mdash;almost one-third of the company's work force. It is clear to me that the first casualties of privatisation are to be the workers themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The majority report was particularly critical of Telstra's privatisation plans. It identified that, in addition to job losses associated with outsourcing, Telstra hoped to reduce staff through internal rationalisations. Redundancies caused by this process were to be `management initiated'. I note that the Telstra management is seeking to change the current redundancy arrangements to see that that happens. I am sure that, if the industrial relations bill currently before the parliament is passed in its present form, that objective will be much easier to achieve. These are not necessarily to be voluntary redundancies. They will inflict great harm and suffering on workers right across this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Project Mercury has clearly been identified as a means to reduce the work force within Telstra, to reduce labour costs by employing contractors at lower rates of pay than those of Telstra's current award workers, to take labour costs off the balance sheets through mechanisms such as joint ventures, to dispose of assets in areas considered to be non&hyphen;core and to release millions of dollars of investment funds. This process would fundamentally change the character of Telstra in such <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a way as to see it move towards a much more profit oriented, market driven supplier. It would have dramatic impacts in terms of external suppliers and it would undermine fundamentally Telstra's capacity to produce a high quality service to Australian consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of this is in line with the program and the policies of this government to pursue the privatisation of Telstra. A lot of this is irrational. It is identifying outsourcing of particular agencies which are currently profitable and are not necessarily a drain upon the company but which will, when removed from the company, reduce the overall employment levels within the company and therefore reduce the company's bottom line for the prospectus. Before the estimates committee Telstra management identified that the net impact to the bottom line profit of the company will be some $600 million per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can only explain the irrationality of these redundancies by understanding that they are the result of external pressures being placed upon Telstra to meet the head count benchmarks, no matter how crude and inappropriate they may be. It is all part of the process in the run-up to privatisation. These pressures may be coming from the views of the market analysts who have been reported in the media. Such pressures are being transmitted by the CS First Boston Group, which conducted the privatisation scoping study on behalf of the government. In the work of senior Telstra management, senior officials of the Department of Finance and members of the scoping study there has been very close cooperation. This is part of the process of preparing a prospectus which will ultimately identify the value of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee was presented with no evidence to establish that particular employees retrenched from Telstra would have the appropriate skills to find work in other sections of industry. The historical pattern is that, whilst this industry is growing at a great rate, that does not necessarily translate into growth in employment levels. It is a capital intensive industry. The removal of unskilled or semi-skilled workers, particularly those over 50 years of age and those in regional areas, will <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4325"> have a profound effect on those regions and on those individuals. It is unlikely that they will be able to find work within the telecommunications industry. The historical evidence does not support contrary conclusions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The international experience is clear. It has to be understood in the context of so&hyphen;called efficiencies and market discipline, which is the so-called driving force behind these reductions. It is interesting to look at the contribution that the overseas telcos being promoted by the government have made to their nations in practice. If we look at Ameritech or US West, two of the US Bell operating companies, we see a similar pattern emerge. We see companies that are being compared to Telstra as their international benchmark that have an absolutely appalling record in terms of their treatment of workers and consumers. This is a good example of the so-called power of the market. But I do not believe it is necessarily an example we should try to emulate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of US West, waiting times for customers attempting to reach a representative have increased in recent times. US West's numbers of employees declined by some 13,500 from 1989 to 1995. We see that a drop in employment leads to a drop in consumer service delivery. There have been increased waiting times for new installations, especially in rural areas. We see an increased number of missed appointments for repairs for both business and residential customers. We see cuts in the construction of basic telephone plant. We see that there has been a 460 per cent increase in the number of customer complaints to the Oregon Public Utility Commission. The service standards of these great models that this government holds up so highly are so bad that in April of this year the commission reimposed rate of return regulations on US West.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> A similar pattern emerges with Bell Atlantic. I suggest to the Senate that these are fundamental issues that affect the long-term ability of this parliament to have real influence over telecommunications policy in this country. This policy of privatisation is being pursued at breakneck speed. It is being introduced at a time when the regulatory frame work to operate in the post-1997 environment is yet to be determined. It is being introduced in such a way as to leave huge doubts about the issues of equity and affordability in the provision of key services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We see that few in the community believe that social justice policy objectives will survive the privatisation process. We have seen that the recently reconstituted board has been carefully chosen to facilitate a profit driven culture within Telstra in the preparation for privatisation. We see that there is a pattern emerging within this government in terms of not providing adequate protection for parliamentary scrutiny and the commitment that they are prepared to go outside the parliamentary process if necessary so as to have their way, no matter what this parliament suggests. That, to me, is something we should all be resisting with all our political abilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that this is a time frame that suggests that the government needs to rush this privatisation process because it will not stand up to public scrutiny, it will not stand up to rigorous scrutiny in terms of the post&hyphen;1997 telecommunications environment. It is quite clear that over the last eight weeks three major packages of legislation have been introduced into this parliament that are yet to have significant community debate. The consumer groups have had little time to analyse these complex legislative packages. in fact, it would need a team of lawyers working around the clock to make sense of the directions that are being followed by this government and to meet the timetable imposed by this government in the establishment of this new environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, is it little wonder therefore that in these circumstances there is still no industry consensus regarding the draft telecommunications bills and the shape of the post&hyphen;1997 operating environment? This is quite clearly a measure that this government needs to reconsider very carefully&mdash;and I trust that this parliament forces it to reconsider very carefully&mdash;and that this is a bill that ought to be rejected by this parliament on its second reading. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4326">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite clear that those that are concerned about sustaining a natural environment, a world&hyphen;class and affordable telewcommunications service, will look to this parliament to reject this bill and to protect the Australian interest, to protect this nation from what is quite clearly a wrong policy, a socially destructive policy, which is founded upon the assumption of political bribery and blackmail.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise with pleasure in this debate to support the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill 1996. It is rather strange that Senator Carr and I actually sat throught the same set of hearings and read the same evidence. I sat there listening to what he had to say and was absolutely amazed that he came to some of the conclusions that he did. He must have been listening to the evidence out of his left ear, I fear.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us return to what this bill was about and the importance of it for Australia. What it will do is bring Telstra up to world&hyphen;class standard. The opponents of this bill like to play on public fear of the unknown by suggesting that this is a giant leap in the dark. In fact, it is quite the opposite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is probably the last cab off the rank in terms of advanced countries in the world and even some of those that are not so advanced. Telstra is the only one of about 20 major telcos around the world that has not been partly privatised or privatised, and this bill is proposing the sale of only one&hyphen;third of Telstra. When you get Fidel Castro part&hyphen;privatising his telco and selling off a fair bit of it over to the people in Mexico you know you are in a rather strange situation in Australia where we have all the opposition parties off to the left of Fidel Castro and Cuba and indeed the former regime in Albania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us examine the opposition's hypocrisy on this part&hyphen;privatisation of Telstra. In 1994, the then Prime Minister, Paul Keating, was asked on the ABC program <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> about the privatisation of Telstra. Reporter Kerry O'Brien asked whether it really mattered if <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Telstra was privately or publicly owned. The answer from Mr Keating was both accurate and succinct: `Ah, not of its essence, no.' That was his response, and that was consistent at the time with Labor's other privatisation decisions with the Commonwealth Bank and the Qantas float.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very difficult to understand why you can support the privatisation of Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank and not support the privatisation of Telstra. I fail to see the ideolgocal basis of one set of decisions and not of the other. The reason you cannot sort of work out the ideology of it is that it is just purely a matter of expediency. It is expedient and it is tragic, particularly when such a sale is in the best interests of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats' position is probably even more curious. They have shown some sensible approaches here today on IR, and I would urge them to do a similar thing with the Telstra bill. They claim, curiously, that they have some sort of mandate to oppose Telstra. They have got a very funny idea of what a mandate is. I thought in that last election that the coalition parties in 1996 won 50 per cent of the Senate seats. I thought we won a 45&hyphen;seat majority in the lower house&mdash;an outstanding majority in the lower house&mdash;and, in the upper house, 50 per cent of the seats. I would have thought that 50 per cent was a pass, and that is exactly what should happen with the Telstra legislation.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us turn to the Telstra inquiry, that famous delaying tactic where the government had totally made up its mind. The opposition sent it off to a reference committee, which was terribly dishonest, because it is a bill. It is called the Telstra bill and, as a matter of fact, at each site for our inquiry they had a sign up that said `Teltsra Bill this way'. So why did it not go to a legislative committee? It did not because they added in a few other bits and pieces to try and make out that this <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4327"> was about a reference. And of course they had control, they had the majority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real game was exposed in this place by Senator Faulkner, who belled the cat by announcing before we had the inquiry that Labor was going to oppose it. Why waste all that money having an inquiry if they were already opposed to it before we went to an inquiry? They compromised the terms of reference of this inquiry by throwing in a whole range of issues unrelated to the terms of reference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sixty per cent of the submissions dealt with overhead cabling. Senator Carr trumpeted the number of submissions, but over two-thirds of those submissions were only one page in length. A lot of the information before the inquiry&mdash;even by the people who turned up&mdash;was ill&hyphen;informed, particularly as we could not find any opponents to the bill who had even read the bill. How on earth can you come out in a public hearing opposed to it if you have not even had a look at it? A substantial number of the submissions did express support for the part&hyphen;privatisation of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After all those hearings, all that time and all those witnesses, we ended up with what was a pretty poor report. The majority report of the opposition simply ignored the majority and weight of the evidence favouring a one-third sale of Telstra. It was intellectually dishonest and it produced a report with a very predetermined position. The majority report quotes evidence from the National Farmers Federation and Australian Women in Agriculture, yet fails to acknowledge their pro-privatisation stance. There is no comparable body of evidence to demonstrate the benefits of keeping the business in public ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had a seminar in this parliament with a speaker in favour of keeping Telstra in full public ownership. He looked for examples around the world to see where it would work better. He could come up with only one&mdash;Iceland. Iceland is the only place where full public ownership works better. I suppose the telephone system in Reykjavik goes about two kilometres out of town, and that is about it. In that sort of area, you could probably run a fairly efficient system.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The inquiry basically was a waste of time. There was no tidal wave of community support for what the opposition was trying to do here on the core issues of the bill. The number of hearing dates was cut by 50 per cent. We could not find much interest out in rural and regional Australia. As a matter of fact, the evidence that we did gain supported the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is somewhat hypocritical for the Labor Party, on the basis of that lack of evidence and on the basis of their former government's position&mdash;former Prime Minister Keating wanting to sell the lot of it a few years ago&mdash;to want to go ahead with that. What people have to remember is that it was the Labor Party that actually started this whole process by giving away half of Telstra's monopoly to Optus and then planning for it to expand further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are proposing is a logical extension of that process. In every country where government owned monopolies have been changed&mdash;exposed to competition&mdash;part&hyphen;privatisation or privatisation has actually followed. This government has placed telecommunications reform very high on its list of priorities for its first term. That is why we are debating it here so early in the time of the new government. The reasons for this are quite obvious.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's telecommunications sector must maintain the momentum of change to ensure that we have a world-class communications infrastructure. The Australian telecommunications market has doubled in size over the last few years. It is a highly contested domestic and international environment and it cannot afford to have a bloated and inefficient Telstra that will not be able to compete in the new markets in the post-1997 environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We must be prepared for new growth. We must have a dynamic flexible company which will take on new demands like the Internet and other telephone based services. Telstra is also facing the reality that its operating expenses are increasing faster than its revenue growth. That also brings in the need for market discipline to get Telstra working as a more efficient operation.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4328">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been some advances in the efficiency of Telstra in recent years, but there is considerable room for improvement.

<PARA>I want to make some remarks on the annual report of the Department of Social Security. The Department of Social Security is one of the most important departments of government. That is brought out by the departmental charter, which is set out on page 3 of the report, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Departmental charter is:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" RIGHT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">to achieve social security policies that meet the needs of the Australian community and to deliver entitlements and services with fairness, courtesy and efficiency.</PARA>
<PARA>You will note that its ends are not limited to simply those who are most vulnerable in society; it also sets out to meet the needs of the Australian community. That is a good way of putting it because in meeting the needs of the most vulnerable in society we are meeting the needs of society as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A core test of a good society is the way it treats its most vulnerable. You are either a good society or not depending upon the way you&mdash;I use the word generically&mdash;treat those who are, in the traditional biblical sense, halt and lame.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amongst those most vulnerable in society are those who are not adequately housed. To use the word that Senator Woodley suggested to me, it is `fundamental' to any good society that it properly houses everybody in society. The importance of that has been stressed to me today by some people who have given up time to come to this parliament to talk on behalf of those people who are not adequately housed now and those who might not be <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> adequately housed in the future.

<PARA>The National Science and Technology Centre represents a very important national institution in a number of respects. I have to point out that I speak not just as a representative of the people of the ACT, given that the centre's main building is housed here in the national capital in the parliamentary triangle, but also on the basis that the work of this institution extends far beyond the borders of the ACT.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It takes science and technology right around the country but I would like to note specifically the work of this institution in rural and regional areas of Australia. Its travelling programs have become a feature of this organisation. They have in place a program which takes science and technology issues and quite successfully attempts to popularise them with schoolchildren in country areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Science and technology is an area in which Australia has great strengths. Nothing highlights this more than the context of the debate we are having at the moment about the partial privatisation of Telstra. The very issue on which we are at a turning point in Australia, technology and industry development in the whole telecommunications area, really highlights, I believe, the base from which we are working in our society when it comes to science and the base level of knowledge and participation in areas such as this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point I make this evening is that it is okay to have policies that put in place programs to advance industry research and development but if we have not got a solid base of knowledge or infrastructure on the ground in Australia that really promotes knowledge amongst children and communities right around the country, it makes it very hard for us to establish that base. There has been quite a significant amount of research done to show the relationship between that base knowledge in the community and participation with technology, and the ability of a country to expand in a particular field.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4330">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to this institution, not only do they manage to run their programs with proportionately less funding than every other major institution, but they manage to do it in a way where they actually take the issues to the people. They set some great examples about how national institutions can run in an inclusive and participatory way, in a way that really brings together and involves just about every aspect of our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you have not visited Questacon during your visits to the ACT, may I suggest you take the time, as it is a very innovative place, full of interest. Everyone who attends there really reaps significant benefit from having a look and participating in the hands&hyphen;on science and technology exhibits that are a feature of the institution.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would also like to speak on the 1995&hyphen;96 annual report of the National Science and Technology Centre. For most of the time covered by this report I have to confess that I had the privilege of being the minister for science. Therefore, the balance of this report covers my period of office. I would like to, first, pay a tribute to the people at the National Science and Technology Centre. They are a fine example of Australian scientists taking the scientific message to the community and encouraging a greater awareness of science in the broad Australian community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In science circles there is a bit of a fear of the image science has. The belief is that science is not seen as an attractive area for Australian students to seek degrees in, or for graduates to do postgraduate or doctoral research in. The belief broadly is that science has a threatening, almost science fiction type image, in which scientists are seen as the bad guys rather than the good guys helping society overcome problems and finding answers to complex issues. So the National Science and Technology Centre does, as Senator Lundy has so capably described, take the message of science to the community and provides a series of exhibits and other facilities for people to become used to dealing with issues of science at the centre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation for Australia is roughly this: we create every year between one per cent <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and three per cent of all the new knowledge discovered in science in the world. That means that our ability to create new knowledge is well ahead of our population as a percentage of the global population and well ahead of our GDP as a percentage of global GDP. We now have nine Nobel Prize winners in Australia which also means that per head of population, or as a percentage of our GDP, measures by which you would assess Australia's standing in the world, we are well ahead of most other countries in the world. We are essentially a very creative country. The trouble for us in this country is that as we sell our commodities like wheat, wool, iron ore and coal in the most unimproved form in the world&mdash;we sell them as base commodities at the lowest price and, therefore, get the least return&mdash;so too does Australia sell its intellectual property.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our scientists create this knowledge but other economies take their creations and turn them into developed products which they sell back to us. We have seen a syndrome in Australia of our creative community in the science sector coming up with new ideas and trying to commercialise those ideas only to find there is a lack of interest in the financial sector or hurdles put in the way of commercialisation that make it impossible or very difficult within this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Someone else comes along and buys that intellectual property, turns that intellectual property into a commodity, a good or a service, and we then participate in the world market buying it back. The issue for the previous government was how you build on and strengthen the creative base of Australian science so that we continue to be a site for creativity and intellectual property creation, and then put in place the various steps necessary to take that intellectual property to the market by commercialising it. That was the fundamental core of the innovation statement brought down by the Keating government in December last year. It put a series of steps down so we could value add to the intellectual property we create.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Until we start doing that more effectively there will always be a situation where science is not understood in the community because <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4331"> its end purpose is not seen or valued. There is a problem that science enrolments at university are falling&mdash;that is a global trend. There is a problem as well with the drop&hyphen;out rate of those enrolled. That is also a global trend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The National Science and Technology Centre, by sparking the imagination of young Australians about the potential of science, is aimed at arresting and turning around that trend. They do a very good job of it. I commend them. I wish there was more of it and I hope the now government continues to fund this centre and the budget for science awareness in Australia, to support things like the ANZAAS conference and to encourage the young Helix club of the CSIRO to bring young students into the science realm, and to do all those things to promote science understanding in Australia. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Institute of Marine Science is located at Cape Ferguson on a 207 hectare site just 50 miles south of Townsville where I have my electorate office, and also in the Dampier&hyphen;Karratha region of north west Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Marine industries are worth some $35 billion annually to Australia and these have been growing at eight per cent per year. The need for ensuring the natural system is protected and managed for sustainable development is quite evident. I was interested to hear Senator Cook's speech on the previous report and I concur with a lot of what he said about Australia's pre&hyphen;eminence in science.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Institute of Marine Science&mdash;AIMS&mdash;has established itself in strategic basic marine science and is supported by both public and private sector interests. The <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> institute recently restructured its three science programs into 12 projects of national significance, removed a layer of management by abolishing program level management and introduced a formal system of project evaluation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well, the institute has conducted a voluntary redundancy scheme to enable efficiency gains through restructure of support sections, shifted the budget towards increased support for capital and maintenance and upgraded its computer systems to allow a modern management information system to be introduced during 1996 and 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The institute has built very strong links with Australian industries, particularly in the petroleum, pharmaceutical and computer technology industries and the wider Asia&hyphen;Pacific region. It has established a long&hyphen;term environmental monitoring program and it has built skills, knowledge and resource assessment, especially in tropical mangrove and coral reef systems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">AIMS is a recognised leader in setting environmental assessment standards. The effectiveness of the improved links with industry, which I mentioned previously, were reflected in the level of the institute's external earnings. In the term of this report, the external earnings of the institute were some $4&half; million. I am personally aware of a number of the people who work at AIMS and of the tremendous work they do and the income they earn for Australia in their science works and in their collaboration with private drug companies in particular, and this is good.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do, however, note with just a fraction of concern the National Commission of Audit which reported in June of this year recommending a range of reviews by the government of its objectives and justification for all programs and services. In particular, the commission noted that a plethora of Commonwealth government science and technology programs were inefficient, unaccountable and complicated. The report concluded that there was considerable scope for rationalisation, improved efficiency and achievement of more targeted outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Townsville community there is a concern that this may mean that AIMS is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4332"> somehow joined with CSIRO and loses its independence and its independent function. There is no factual basis for that at this time, but there is that feeling around scientific, academic and business circles in Townsville that this might happen. From the comments that have been made to me by the people at AIMS&mdash;and I do not profess to be in any way an expert in this area&mdash;I share this concern about a move which may be detrimental to the whole system of science agencies in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know the member for Herbert, Mr Peter Lindsay, has also been approached. Whilst it would be improper for me to say he shares my concerns, because that is for him to say, I know that he is following this matter as well. Obviously, as well we have spoken to the relevant ministers and no decision has been made; it is part of a long&hyphen;term process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thought this was an appropriate time, while discussing this report, to place on record the great work that AIMS does as an independent scientific organisation. Until I can be convinced that some other form of structure would be beneficial, I remain a very strong and firm supporter of AIMS as an independent scientific organisation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I relate to many of the things the previous speaker said. We are well served by AIMS; it is in many senses a classic science research institute which delivers a high quality product for Australia and is overshadowed, to some extent, by its bigger brother, the CSIRO. Nonetheless, nothing can detract from its work. It is well known in the fields of research associated with the Great Barrier Reef, fisheries, offshore management of the marine <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> environment and whole areas of other research that it conducts which is globally recognised as being of world quality. It is seen as an agency to which other agencies in the world turn for particular information, particularly tropical marine environments as well other marine environments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The agency is chaired by a board of which Professor Peter Andrews is the chairman, joined by Dr Meryl Williams, Mr Malcolm Kinnaird, Dr Ray George and Mr Geoff Hill. It is a board with a blend of scientific expertise and commercial understanding. AIMS has come up with a number of scientific breakthroughs which, if taken to commerciality, will benefit Australian science and give a return to this nation. Getting the right balance between research and discovery and getting the commercial advantages out of that for this nation is something that AIMS is very serious about. Its external earnings reflect its success in that regard. This board is balanced to achieve that result. I think all of them should be commended. In particular, I would like to commend the Director of AIMS, Dr Russell Reichelt. He is indeed a fine example of one of Australia's leading scientists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The challenge for AIMS is not only to maintain and continue its fine reputation, something I am sure it will do, but to look to the future and see what the challenges are for an institute like this. In September 1994, as a consequence of a decision of the United Nations, the territory of Australia was enlarged by 150 per cent&mdash;that is, the exclusive economic zone for Australia meant that our seabed boundary was extended from the three&hyphen;mile limit to 200 nautical miles from the low tide mark or the edge of the continental shelf, whichever is the farthest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For a continent like Australia, which stretches across many latitudes and, when you consider our island territories as well, covers climatic conditions ranging from tropical to Antarctic and all sea conditions and sub&hyphen;sea surfaces that could be imagined, this is a massive challenge. Australia now ranks as the second largest country in the world in terms of its offshore marine responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the law of the sea, the requirement is that nations have access to the resources&mdash; <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4333">that is, the living organisms in the water column as well as seabed resources and surface rights&mdash;if they exploit them to a sustainable level. In order to know what a sustainable level is, baseline studies need to be conducted to work out what the current level is and what sustainability looks like. If we do not exploit those resources to sustainability, some other nation can do so under the terms of this treaty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is in Australia's national interest is to employ the expertise of an agency like AIMS, which would be the leading agency in scientific research in this field in Australia, to work with the states and the Commonwealth, and other scientific agencies such as the Oceanography Division of the CSIRO, to commence a series of baseline studies so that we can be clear as to what the sustainability of Australia's marine environment might be. That means if we are challenged about our rights to exploit resources, living and mineral, hydrocarbon or whatever, we are able to produce the definitive argument as to what sustainability is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think AIMS can do that job. It is the agency that should lead in that job. I know the government is moving towards setting up that inquiry. I commend AIMS as being the body that can carry it through.</PARA>

<STATE> (Tasmania)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(7.21 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter that I wish to raise this evening in the adjournment debate is the question of certain legal aid guidelines that applied in Tasmania in relation to the capacity of certain people to get aid in certain circumstances. As a result of the former government's so&hyphen;called access to justice program, a guideline was developed whereby women would be provided with assistance to institute property settlement proceedings where the principal asset of the marriage was equity in the former matrimonial home of between $30,000 and $60,000. Another guideline provided for assistance to women to obtain the return of furniture and chattels.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have no objection to those guidelines as such, other than that they were framed in a blatantly sexist way. Under those guidelines a husband and wife could be in exactly the same financial position, seeking legal aid to fight or argue over property, and the Legal Aid Commission could say to the wife, `You're a woman, we will fund you', but to the man, `Because you're a male, we won't fund you.' I thought that was grossly unjust and grossly inappropriate. Indeed, I would suggest that that is political correctness gone mad.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result, I raised it at Senate estimates committee with the Attorney-General's Department. They then considered the guideline and provided me with an answer just a day or so ago, indicating that they thought the guideline was in breach of anti&hyphen;discrimination legislation. It would be fair to say that, if it were couched in non-sexist terms, this particular guideline would undoubtedly favour 95 <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4334"> per cent women and five per cent men. That would be appropriate, because it would be fair to say that in these sorts of disputes the majority of people who do not have the funding to pursue such claims are women. However, to couch the guidelines in such a sexist way was inappropriate. I am glad that I have been fortified in that view by the Attorney-General's Department which, as a result, will be writing to the Legal Aid Commission in Tasmania about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this issue highlights is that the former government, in trying to be so politically correct, unfortunately created injustice and alienated people within the community by having such guidelines. The chances are that they were well intentioned, but it was political correctness gone mad which had an impact of creating this injustice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would not have raised this matter this evening but for some of the gratuitous comments made by the director of legal aid concerning me. In making these comments, I did not in any way refer to anybody in particular or seek to identify or embarrass anybody in particular. Unfortunately, the director of legal aid in Tasmania made some gratuitous comments, such as, `We have heard nothing from Senator Abetz about legal aid funding in Tasmania.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the record, let me say that Mr Colin Brown has been in my office. We have discussed the very issue of legal aid funding in Tasmania. Further, as chair of the government members committee on Attorney-General and justice matters, I was involved in an extensive campaign to assist the community legal centres to ensure that they were quarantined as much as possible from the government cutbacks that were necessary because of the previous mismanagement of our economy by Labor. I have received many letters of thanks from those community legal centres right around Australia for my involvement. So it is somewhat incongruous for the director of legal aid to have made those sorts of comments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me also say that the director of legal aid gave me what I believe to be a very fruitful avenue of inquiry to try to save money in the Attorney-General's Department <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and thus free up extra money for legal aid. In fact, anybody who is interested can have a look at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of the Senate estimates committee where I followed up a number of questions and suggestions put to me by the director of legal aid in Tasmania as to how moneys might be saved. I find it somewhat unfortunate that Mr Brown has found it necessary to make those comments in the media, which I think most people would see as a cheap, political shot, when he was unable to deal with the substance of the complaint.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, I look forward to ongoing, meaningful discussions with Mr Colin Brown, the director of legal aid in Tasmania.

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SF4">Senator COONEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A very great state, because that was where I was born. He has said that the former government created injustice and that their adherence to political correctness was one of the means by which they did that. I think Senator Abetz raises a very big issue, and that is the issue of how we run our legal system, how we run that arm of government which is dealt with in chapter <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4335"> 3 of the constitution&mdash;that is, the judicial arm of government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem is not so much a previous government's adherence to political correctness but the fact that proper funding has not been put into this area. Fortunately, Senator McKiernan has decided to have an inquiry, and the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee is presently preparing to hold public hearings into this.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Abetz is on that committee and no doubt he will make his usual great contribution to it. It would be a good thing if we waited until that inquiry was held before we came to conclusions about whether guidelines are correct or where the problems lie.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last Thursday the Senate voted against a motion of disallowance which referred to the increase in fees in the Commonwealth courts. This is a related issue because it deals with the question of how we are going to finance our judicial system, our legal system. Unfortunately, much of the debate centred around the question of whether or not it ought to be user pays. In the end, the Senate came down very largely on the side that the users should pay in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me extraordinary that one of the core functions of government should be approached on the basis that the people who are going to have access to that core function have to pay for it. The other core functions are the government itself, the administration of the Commonwealth, and the legislature. It seems to me to be extraordinary that at least one arm of that is looked at in terms of value for money. In that context, there is an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New Statesman &amp; Society</EMPHASIS> magazine of 8 December 1995 which has a bit to say about the attitudes and the way in which we run society. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The arguments about values are disingenuous; calculated to conceal what has become obvious to all over the past 20 years&mdash;that monetary values have superseded all others, and that the sublimest expression of idealism, hope and high moral purpose in the world now is "value for money": if money has become the supreme measure of value, why should those who have been so happy to underwrite this development complain?</PARA>
<PARA>That perhaps sums up the sorts of presumptions and suppositions that too many people <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are making about the legal system. Instead of facing the need to make the system fair, just and available, we look for excuses for not so making it. The excuses include the following propositions: that injustice is brought about because the former government adhered to what is said was political correctness; that the guidelines in Tasmania are the problem; and that everything is the problem, except the fact that there ought to be adequate resources devoted to this arm of government so that it can work properly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">May I say in passing that it is not only the judicial arm that is being starved of resources but also this very legislature. The facilities made available to people both in this place and in the other place are also being cut down. Having listened to the contribution made by Senator Abetz, it is proper that the true picture is raised; that is, a lot of work has to be done to make sure that everybody in the community, no matter how poor or how rich, has equal access to the law. Equal access to the law means not simply being represented by somebody but being represented by a person who is competent, who has time and who has the resources available to give to not only the richest but also the poorest and all those in between. That, unfortunately, is not happening now. I doubt very much whether anybody in this chamber at the moment could afford to run a case that went for any length of time, and that is a tragedy. It is a tragedy brought about&mdash;in part at least&mdash;by the corruptions of the values by which we live, which have occurred in recent times.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator Alston, said yesterday in this place:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the weight of national and international scientific opinion is that there is no substantive evidence of adverse health and safety effects from radiofrequency emissions at typical levels.</PARA>
<PARA>What needs to be understood however is that very few studies in the so-called weight of national and international scientific opinion, which is the sort that is to be re-examined by the World Health Organisation, are relevant to the evaluation of radiofrequency exposure <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4336"> on the development of cancer in humans. These are not my words; they come from the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection. The commission stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most of the established biological effects of exposure to RF fields are consistent with responses to induced heating&mdash;thermal effects&mdash;resulting in rises in tissue or body temperature of greater than one degree Celsius. Most studies examined endpoints other than cancer, many examined physiological and thermoregulatory responses, effects on behaviour and on the induction of lense opacities (cataracts) and adverse reproductive outcomes following acute exposure to relatively high levels of radiofrequency fields.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>The minister failed to point out yesterday that the current research is primarily about heat effects of radiation. The minister's words also deny the fact that a growing body of work does show adverse health effects. These denials are just like the denials which we heard and still hear from the tobacco industry, and which were once heard from the proponents of the asbestos industry. The government is using the defensive words of the telecommunications industry and yet accuses those of us who want to know what is really going on of having closed minds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government and industry are saying, `You have not yet proved that some children are getting leukaemia as a result of living close to a TV transmitter tower. You have not yet proved that brain tumours are the result of using mobile phones and you have not yet proved that the damage electromagnetic radiation has been shown to cause human cells has ramifications for human health.' If the telecommunications carriers and others were pharmaceutical manufacturers, they would be required to prove that their products were not harmful to human health. They would not expect the research to be done after millions of people had already used their product.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The telecommunications industry says we should be reassured because the technology meets Australian standards. A CSIRO report entitled `Radiofrequency radiation exposure standards in Australia and New Zealand: biological effects, part 1' raises concerns about potential adverse health effects of long&hyphen; <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> term, low&hyphen;level, chronic exposure to radiofrequency radiation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It says some of the effects which have emerged include: promotion of cancer growth, including leukaemia, breast cancer and brain tumours; degenerative changes in the retina, cornea and iris of the eye; changes in brain chemistry and drug effectiveness; impaired learning and memory function. It also says extremely low levels of radiofrequency radiation&mdash;that is, thousands of times less than the safety limits given in the US and Australian standards&mdash;have promoted cancer and birth defects in animal experiments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Studies have been done and are currently under way by independent researchers who do not have to adopt a defensive stand&mdash;studies which have been criticised by an industry which has a great deal to lose if the preliminary findings are any indication of what we might find.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dr Peter French, head of immunology at St Vincents Hospital in Sydney, has commenced laboratory testing of human cell culture and found that electromagnetic radiation causes changes to genetic make&hyphen;up. Gene transcription&mdash;the way in which genes are activated to form different cell types&mdash;is affected by exposure. Some DNA expression is turned on and some is turned off by exposure to electromagnetic radiation. He has also found that proteinaceous water in the body in places such as the eyeballs and surrounding the brain is affected by electromagnetic radiation. Dr French says it is possible that headaches associated with mobile phones are likely to be caused by the exposure of blood vessels. He regards this as fundamental and important work, but I remind the Senate that there is presently no funding to continue his research.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dr Bruce Hocking undertook an epidemiological study last year and found that, within four kilometres of a television transmitter tower in a residential area of Sydney, rates of childhood leukaemia were 60 per cent higher than in another area away from the tower, and mortality rates from the illness were 100 per cent higher. More work needs to be done to expand the study and look, for instance, at impacts on adults as well as children.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4337">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same researcher invited responses from mobile phone users who experienced effects from their use of mobile phones. More than 50 complained about a range of consistent symptoms, including headaches, numbness, aching jaw and hot spots in the head. For very many these symptoms disappeared when they stopped using their mobiles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These studies do not prove that brain tumours are caused by mobile phones or mobile phone towers&mdash;very far from it. They merely alert us to the fact that we do not know. They say we must be cautious, we must adopt the precautionary principle and we must do more research&mdash;research which is independent, not research which merely confirms what the industry would hope to find.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I finish by noting the remarks of Senator Boswell this afternoon in the Telstra debate. He said, `I think that the Democrats are fools to have promoted recommendation No. 35 of the report of the inquiry, which proposes that a levy be raised from contributors responsible for electromagnetic radiation to finance independent research into public health issues concerning EMR.' Quite obviously, he has not caught up with Senator Alston's announcement yesterday that $4.5 million would pay for such research over the next four years and that it would be funded by increases on industry licences. I will see that Senator Boswell gets a copy of the press release shortly.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In common with other senators in this place, I have the opportunity to have artworks from the Parliament House collection in my office. Some we choose; some we get because no&hyphen;one else wants them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One painting that attracted my eye and my curiosity now hangs in my office. It is a painting of the right honourable Sir George Pearce by Dargie in original oil. I chose it originally because it was a pleasant painting, but on inquiring as to the background of this <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> man, I was impressed to learn he had served in the Senate for 37 years. I thought he was an appropriate role model. I also learnt that he had held a number of positions, including chairman of committees. As I asked about him so often, my staff even put a short `biog' against the portrait.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some weeks ago, my office received a phone call from the guide desk, advising that a granddaughter of Sir George Pearce was keen to view the portrait of her grandfather. Regrettably I was not here, but my staff met with Mr and Mrs Janet and Alan Righetti from Queensland and they learnt so much more about this famous Australian that I thought I would like to share it with other senators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While it is true that Sir George Pearce did serve for 37 years and was a chairman of committees, he was so much more than that. I was particularly interested in the fact that he was a member of three political parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sir George was one of 10 in a poor family, his father being a blacksmith in South Australia. His formal education finished at 12 years of age and he walked beside his horse with pick and shovel to Kalgoorlie from Perth to try his luck at the goldfields&mdash;obviously none too successfully, because he returned to Perth and started a 57&hyphen;hour a week job as an apprentice carpenter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He rose through the trade union movement and was elected as a senator for Western Australia in the first federal government in 1901. He became defence minister in 1910 and, among other credits, founded the Royal Australian Navy. He was also defence minister during the First World War. He had a long interest in aviation being the first politician in Australia to use air travel to cover his vast electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before the First World War he set up a flying school at Point Cook in Victoria and in 1921 he brought the RAAF into existence. Other portfolios that Sir George held at the same time as his defence portfolio were external affairs and home territories. He was appointed a privy counsellor in 1921 and knighted in 1927. He retired from the Senate in 1938 and died in 1952, aged 82. In 1964, Sir Robert Menzies said about Sir George:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4338">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In my opinion speaking about Cabinet, I have never sat in with an abler man than George Pearce. He was a man of extraordinary experience and he had great wisdom.</PARA>
<PARA>Sir Robert Menzies went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I look back on my good fortune to have sat in a cabinet with him for three years as one of the highs in my life.</PARA>
<PARA>This praise from a Liberal Prime Minister about a man who started his political career with the ALP&mdash;and then saw the light obviously&mdash;and left school at 12 years of age says something.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Parliamentary Handbook</EMPHASIS> lists his political affiliations as being firstly a member of the Labor Party, then a member of the National Party from 1917 and finally a member of the United Australia Party from 1931. Obviously, he was a great political survivor. I have always admired the portrait of the Rt Hon. Sir George Pearce. Now that I know more of his background I am even more pleased to have it in my office. I am also pleased that his granddaughter knows her grandfather has not been forgotten and that his portrait is not languishing in some basement.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

It is actually pleasing to hear someone on the other side recognise the worth and value of trade union members who end up in the Senate. They obviously make great contributions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to return to some of the issues I raised today in the Senate during the debate on matters of public interest which go to the question of political leadership and political integrity. Unfortunately, I was unable to finish my remarks due to the constant interruption of senators on the government side who were obviously most embarrassed about the revelations that I was bringing to the attention of the Senate relating to the infiltration of Liberal Party branches in southern Sydney by extreme right&hyphen;wing elements. In particular, I referred to newspaper reports emanating from <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> more moderate members of the Liberal Party in New South Wales, including Liberal members of the state parliament. Those reports referred to the grave concerns they have about what was happening in their own branches.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to go back to refer to an article that was published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on Saturday, 27 July which dealt with this very serious issue. The Liberal Party hierarchy in New South Wales, at the pinnacle of which is none other than the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, has really failed to do anything to curb this issue. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The man regarded as the leader of the young right&hyphen;wingers is a Sydney lawyer, John White, who was one of the unsuccessful candidates for preselection at Hughes.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr White had been involved in the stacking of the Menai branch where there was, and one could describe it as, a right&hyphen;wing almost neo&hyphen;fascist takeover. One of Mr White's colleagues was a chap by the name of Wade McInerney. The McInerney family are members of the Liberal Party. Wade's brother, Dallas McInerney, is rather notorious.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dallas McInerney, as I am sure honourable senators will recall&mdash;and certainly members of the Liberal Party will recall&mdash;gained some notoriety during the last state election in New South Wales. Mr Dallas McInerney was on the staff of Chris Downy the Liberal member for Sutherland. He used the telephone in the member's office to make threatening phone calls to the owner of a pizza shop who, according to Mr McInerney, had made a terrible mistake of actually leasing premises to a then Labor candidate for the seat.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4339">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to draw to the attention of the Senate what has been happening since that article was written. There was a further article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph </EMPHASIS>on 31 August this year which revealed that branches of the Young Liberals in this region had put onto the Internet what could only be described as fascist or Nazi party propaganda. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS> article states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NSW Liberal Party has demanded its youth wing remove an Internet site that invites young computer users to read the views of extreme right&hyphen;wing groups, including Nazis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The party has been embarrassed by the web site of the Young Liberals' Hughes&hyphen;Sutherland branch, which includes "Frequently Asked Questions" about the Nazi movement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The site, set up by a small number of members in the southern Sydney branch, describes the Holocaust as an "unfortunate but understandable" event that result from "allied inflicted acts of war".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Up until 11.30am yesterday, visitors to the "links page" of the Sutherland&hyphen;Hughes Young Liberals web site would have found the Nazi site&mdash;along with "other interesting pages", such as the Prime Minister's Home Page.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">By early afternoon, following inquiries by <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS> , the Nazi "link" had been removed on the orders of Riley St headquarters.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>That is the headquarters of the New South Wales Liberal Party. The article goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite this intervention, intrepid Internet users could still gain access to the Nazi site late yesterday by clicking onto Queensland University of Technology Liberal Club (also listed on the Hughes&hyphen;Sutherland Young Liberals page).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Queensland site contains a link to the same propaganda as well as a pointer to the extreme right&hyphen;wing League of Rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Nazi site, compiled in the US, celebrates the "outstanding leadership" of Adolf Hitler and claims "no genocide" took place during World War II.</PARA>
<PARA>What we have here are some very extreme, dangerous young Liberals infiltrating the branches in the Sutherland shire and surrounding areas&mdash;only a stone's throw from the St George area where the Prime Minister lived for many years&mdash;and touting this type of absolute garbage, this revisionist history promulgated by the likes of David Irving and others. We have never really experienced the provision of this sort of information by major political parties before. This type of political <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> propaganda has not been a feature of Australian politics in the past, except in very limited circumstances. Now we have seen examples of where, unfortunately in the Liberal Party, there are people who want to push this barrow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that action was taken by the New South Wales branch officials to stop that. I think that is to be commended. It is unfortunate, particularly given the current climate of some of the political debate taking place in this country, such as the extremist views of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson), that some people are allowed to put this type of propaganda over the Internet and through other official party organs of the Liberal Party. I believe it is the duty of the Prime Minister to stamp out this sort of thing, to do it at the outset&mdash;not to flounder around talking about the right to free expression and freedom of speech.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today I heard ministers stand up and attack the Labor Party&mdash;the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator Alston, did so in response to a question from Senator Boswell&mdash;because we happen to have a reasonable percentage of our members of parliament with trade union backgrounds. They condemn individuals for the simple fact they happen to be trade union members. Trade unions around the world have been at the forefront of standing up for freedom and democracy. There are trade unions leaders even today putting their lives on the line in other countries for the right of workers to have democratic and collective representation. Fortunately, that has never had to happen in this country. I think it is about time the Prime Minister, leading ministers of the government and other members of the government stopped these sorts of disgraceful and disparaging attacks upon individuals and started to clean up the mess that certainly exists in some of the Liberal Party branches in New South Wales.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is Wednesday night, but I did just want to take a few minutes of the Senate's time to make a comment on the speech about a famous Australian, Sir George <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4340"> Pearce, which my colleague Senator Brownhill has just completed. I thought I might just add a couple of comments to Senator Brownhill's speech because of some coincidences.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sir George Pearce has, I think, a granddaughter in Brisbane&mdash;she may be a grand&hyphen;niece; I am not quite sure&mdash;who is well known to me. Her name is Mrs Jane Prentice. Mrs Prentice is very much involved with the Liberal Party in Queensland. She is married to Mr Ian Prentice, who was for several years a Liberal member of the Queensland state parliament. In fact, he was one of the group which&mdash;those of you who know anything about Queensland history will remember this&mdash;prior to 1983 was referred to as the `ginger group' of the Liberal Party in Queensland. He was one of those members of parliament who, over a principle, ended up departing from our then coalition colleagues in Queensland. What happened after that is, of course, all history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Coincidentally, Mr Prentice, who is the Queensland Liberals' solicitor, just last week in the Supreme Court had a major victory over the Labor Party involving my northern city of Townsville.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was at the Prentices' house a year or so ago and I noticed a book in their library. I think the title of it was <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">From Carpenter to Cabinet</EMPHASIS>. Mrs Prentice indicated to me that it was about her grandfather or uncle or great&hyphen;grandfather, so I borrowed the book to read. I must confess that it is still sitting in my library.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just thought that the interesting aspect of history Senator Brownhill raised had that further coincidental element in that the Prentices are people who have been very much involved in politics in many aspects over a long period of time in Queensland. So the fascinating political elements of the life of Sir George Pearce continue on in his descendants. Certainly, Senator Brownhill's speech about a person who was obviously quite significant in Australia's political history made interesting listening. I am sure my friends the Prentices will be interested to read  Senator Brownhill's speech when I forward it on to them, as I surely will.</PARA>
