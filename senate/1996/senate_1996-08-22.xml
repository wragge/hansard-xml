<TIME.STAMP>(9.43 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;On behalf of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances I would like to report to the Senate on the delegated legislation under which the recent census was conducted. Most public comment on these legislative provisions was concerned with the fine of $100 per day for failing to fill out the form. It is, however, not widely known that the whole conduct of the census was based on legislative instruments made by the executive, some of which were not only not subject to parliamentary scrutiny, but also were not even required to be tabled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The enabling act for the census is the Census and Statistics Act 1905, which is a short act with provision for the collection of general statistics as well as for the census. The legislative scheme of that act is to provide the barest structural bones, which are to be filled out by delegated legislation. The act provides for a census to be taken in each fifth year after 1981, although these may be increased by regulation. There is nothing objectionable in this because the entire process so far is under parliamentary control, with any such regulations being subject to scrutiny and possible disallowance. However, the act then provides for the actual census day to be appointed by proclamation. Again, there is nothing exceptional in such a provision. Indeed, it may be the most appropriate and practical option. What is exceptional is that there are no formal procedures for any parliamentary scrutiny of this action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Governor&hyphen;General in fact proclaimed 6 August 1996 as the census day, sealing the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> proclamation with the great seal of Australia. This proclamation was made on 13 June 1996 but was not gazetted until 26 June 1996, two days before parliament rose. This lack of parliamentary control will, however, be corrected with the passage of the Legislative Instruments Bill 1996, which provides for scrutiny of such proclamations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two notices given by the Australian Statistician are also of concern because they are the basis for the obligation to fill out the census form. Here also both notices were only made and gazetted on 26 June 1996, and there is no requirement for them to be tabled or subject to scrutiny. One notice required every occupier of a private dwelling to fill out the census household form, while the other required people not counted in a household to fill out the census form. This is another instance of legislation regarding which the parliament may at present have no knowledge but which will be subject to full scrutiny under the proposed Legislative Instruments Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The position is more satisfactory in respect of the contents of the census questions, which were prescribed in the census regulations which commenced as early as 6 September 1994. This was entirely appropriate because the early tabling ensured that these regulations satisfied the two essential criteria for delegated legislation, which are parliamentary control and adequate time for that control to be exercised. The census forms themselves are actually not at present subject to tabling or disallowance but, again, would be under the new bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The position was also satisfactory in respect of other delegated legislation necessary to implement the act in its application to the census. As well as providing for the questions in the forms, the census regulations prescribed other relevant matters. The related statistics regulations provided for persons to be engaged for the purposes of the census and for such officers to maintain secrecy in relation to the forms. Finally, the statistics determination, which under the act is a statutory rule, provides for the disclosure of information collected in the census. All these instruments are subject to full parliamentary scrutiny.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2881">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, then, the taking of the census involved two separate series of principal regulations made by the Governor&hyphen;General&mdash;one principal series of statutory rules cited as a determination and made by the minister, one proclamation by the Governor&hyphen;General, and two notices and two forms made by the Australian Statistician. All this was done under an act which is only seven pages long.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The taking of the census illustrates the diversity and variety of delegated legislation and its central role in modern public administration. It also reveals that crucial aspects of important legislation, affecting, in this case, the entire population of Australia, are subject neither to parliamentary disallowance nor even to tabling. However, as mentioned earlier, that problem should be solved by the Legislative Instruments Bill. The Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances is taking a close interest in the provisions of that bill to ensure that the interests of parliament are protected, and I will report to the Senate in detail in due course.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>On 23 May this year, the Senate referred to the Senate Economics References Committee, for inquiry and report, the matter of the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996. The committee was given just three months to hold public hearings and draft a report on the legislation. The <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2885"> length and complexity of this report reflects the enormity and importance of the subject of industrial relations in Australia. The committee received more than 1,400 submissions, over 1,000 of which were from individuals who expressed concern about the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee held 18 public hearings in all capital cities and some regional centres over a period of just 21 working days. This is believed to be the most concentrated public inquiry phase ever undertaken by a Senate committee. Given the concentrated process, I think it is appropriate now, rather than when I may later run out of time, that I acknowledge the outstanding efforts of the staff of the secretariat. In particular, I would like to mention Rob Diamond, the secretary of the Economics References Committee secretariat, research officers Pippa Carron, Geoff Dawson, Merrilyn Pyle and Maurice Chalmers, executive assistant Diane Strong, and seconded departmental officer Leah Edwards. Also, given the taxing nature of the public hearings, I think it is important to acknowledge the work that occurred in the Senate print room and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> and SAVO contribution in ensuring that we met the report&hyphen;back date today. Overall, the contribution of all involved in the process has been outstanding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is with mixed feelings of pleasure and disquiet that I now table the report. Aside from reaching the end of such a concentrated and demanding process, I take pleasure that the process and the outcome has well been worth while. This has obviously been an extremely controversial subject matter. But my determination to manage the process by consensus has been successful, with the overwhelming support of all of my colleagues on the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the fact that it was accepted from the outset that government members of the committee would diverge on the conclusions and the recommendations arising from the inquiry, I believe, and committee members other than those of just the opposition have concurred, that the process of this inquiry was balanced and that the overall presentation of the evidence in the report is also balanced. Minister Reith has, however, sought to undermine this inquiry by suggesting that the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> inquiry lacked some credibility regarding the selection of witnesses. It is a credit to the media that they did not run with this story, which has no basis in fact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, the media did run with the story that coalition sources claimed that I had deliberately designed the hearing schedule to facilitate my desire for a long weekend in Cairns with my husband and son. I wish I had had the time. I am pleased to note that coalition senators on the committee dissociated themselves from this story, which was an obvious attempt to deflect attention from the main issues at hand&mdash;to play the man, or the woman, rather than the issues. So much for women in parliament and so much for assisting workers with family responsibilities!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What leads to my disquiet is that the government feels the need to resort to this type of conduct. But what also leads to my disquiet is the widespread community concern put before this committee. What leads to my disquiet is that the government is not listening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill represents a radical reshaping of Australia's industrial relations law. It encourages&mdash;and the majority of the committee would say it forces&mdash;a move away from a reliance on award conditions towards enterprise bargaining and individual bargaining. While there have previously been moves towards a more enterprise focus in industrial relations, this bill represents a major step towards a deregulated labour market&mdash;and the implications of this are profound. Thus, it is not surprising that this inquiry attracted quite a lot of interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Pages 4 to 7 of the report summarise the responses received by this inquiry to the bill. But I would like to highlight, in directing senators to those pages, that responses came not only from a large number of unions and some employer organisations but also from a large number of community groups, churches, religious organisations, youth, women's organisations, organisations representing the ethnic community and the disabled&mdash;all, or the vast majority, of which raised significant concerns with this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a complex bill containing a large number of proposed changes, the full effect of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2886"> which can be appreciated only by looking at how they interact with each other. For example, award conditions will be limited to 18 allowable matters, and conditions on other matters will lapse. That means that award employees will not be able to maintain their status quo by doing nothing; they will not be comfortable and secure. They will be forced to negotiate to try to win back their present conditions, outside the 18 allowable matters, into an agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The evidence showed that in many fields conditions outside the 18 allowable matters are very important to workers. It is not just a matter of hot water, as Minister Reith has referred to dismissively. At the same time, the existing no disadvantage test in negotiating agreements is to be repealed. That opens the way for employers to force employees, where possible, into agreements with conditions less than their previous award.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Worse, under section 152, employees might come under pressure to accept state agreements with minimum wages and conditions worse than the award's minimum condition for federal agreements. Exploitative employers will be able to shop around for the jurisdiction that offers the lowest common denominator and, worse, good employers will be forced to compete.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Meanwhile, the role of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission as independent umpire will be reduced. The commission will have no power to arbitrate on disputes outside the 18 allowable matters which may well lead to an increase in industrial disputation. Similarly, with the Employment Advocate there will be no vetting, no public scrutiny, limited union access and no independent umpire. Many submissions from expert commentators said it was absolutely essential to have an independent check of Australian workplace agreements to prevent illegal exploitation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are just some examples. The important thing is that the effects of the bill must be seen as a whole. The majority of the committee has no doubt that the overall effect of this bill will be to worsen the lot of many workers in our society&mdash;workers who, for one reason <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> or another, are in a limited bargaining position for negotiating agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill makes a mockery of John Howard's rock&hyphen;solid guarantee that no worker would be worse off. People in less skilled labour intensive jobs are more likely to be in a poor bargaining position and they will be worse off. Women, young people and people without good English are also in a limited bargaining position and they will be worse off. Part-time employees are more likely to be in a poor bargaining position and they will be worse off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to the committee's evidence, this is exactly what has happened in New Zealand since deregulation in 1991. According to the committee's evidence, this is exactly what has happened in Western Australia, Victoria and Tasmania since deregulation during the 1990s. The same result will be likely under this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said earlier, the bill is a complex document and the majority of the committee has many detailed concerns, which I do not have the time to mention now. They are dealt with in the report, alongside a balanced presentation of the overall evidence given before the committee. But let me focus on just one matter of personal bias.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government claims that this bill is friendly to part-time employees and employees with family responsibilities. The government is proud that it has in the object section special reference to these matters. Employers generally support the government's claims. In fact, page 133 presents their arguments perhaps all too well. I note at the bottom of page 133 that it does not clearly delineate what is obviously an employer assertion from what is more point to the fact outlined in 5.17.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The majority of the committee cannot agree that this bill will assist part-time workers or workers with family responsibilities. We do not see anything concrete in the detailed provisions of the bill that supports this worthy object. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to this report. At the outset I want to place on record the government members' appreciation of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2887"> work that was put into this inquiry by the secretariat and staff. I have never seen a secretariat that has had to work as hard or for as many hours on any report as the secretariat did in this case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I notice that Rob Diamond, Pippa Carron and Merrilyn Pyle are in the chamber, but there were others mentioned by Senator Jacinta Collins who worked on this. They were certainly put under pressures that I do not think any secretariat should be put under. But we must bear in mind that the nature, the procedure and the number of hearings of this committee were determined not by us but by the majority members of the committee, who were from the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do appreciate the professionalism of the staff and the manner in which they worked throughout this whole inquiry. Also I would particularly like to mention the Sound and Vision Office and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, who at some hearings sat for hours on end without a break. That was highlighted by government members on that committee on one or two occasions. I remember particularly a hearing in Perth where they sat for some four hours without a break. It is ironic that we were talking about workplace reform, yet asking our secretariat staff and others to work at such a pace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From the outset let me say that, along with the debate that occurred prior to this reference being sent to the committee, we believed that this inquiry was an abuse of the Senate committee system. It was an abuse of the system because for the first time since October 1994, when the new committee structure was put in place, a bill was sent to a reference committee and not to a legislation committee, which is properly set up for legislation. That was done for obvious political reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We heard Senator Jacinta Collins talk about majority reports. The only reason that there is a majority report in this case is because the reference committee, as you know, is dominated by a majority of Labor senators, which is not representative of the state of the numbers in this chamber. It should have gone to a legislation committee and not to a reference committee. If that had happened, then you would have seen a different report.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can say that from the outset it was obvious that this was not the Labor Party's inquiry or anybody else's inquiry; it was the ACTU's inquiry. It was facilitated by Labor senators, all with strong union backgrounds and strong ACTU backgrounds. It is easy to follow the conduct of the inquiry, the way things happened during the inquiry and the influence that the ACTU had on this inquiry from its very commencement.</PARA>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Please notify the ACTU of workers you believe would make good witnesses&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>This gives us some idea of the orchestration that took place. At the end of the letter, Tim Pallas says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will be contacting unions again to advise of arrangements for attendance and other activities.</PARA>
<PARA>I am not quite sure what `other activities' means, unless we could perhaps take as a guide the activities that took place in front of this place the other day. The other activities, I presume, were the putting of pressure on members of the committee throughout the public hearings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After all of this pleading and publicity from the ACTU in their effort to direct this inquiry, what did we actually get? We heard Senator Jacinta Collins talk about the number of submissions opposing the legislation. In fact, we got one response per 2,000 union members. That was the response&mdash;one per 2,000. Taking all of the workers in Australia, because only 30 per cent of Australian workers are unionised, on average there was one response per 6,000 workers. That is how much response the ACTU was able to garner <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> from the work force. So there is no spontaneous opposition at all to this bill. The only opposition that abounds around this bill is that which has been orchestrated by the ACTU in order to try to campaign as publicly as possible through this Senate inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Compare this with the last major change in industrial relations&mdash;Brereton's 1993 bill. At the time many people said that that 1993 bill was a major change to the face of industrial relations in Australia. But what did we have then? One submission representing employees, and that submission was from the ACTU. And how long did that inquiry last? A total of 26 days from the time it was introduced into the Senate until the time the committee report was made, which included calling for submissions, I think two or three days of public hearings and then the report being brought down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We might ask: why the response this time? I guess we would have to look at the situation over the past number of years of falling union membership, of let us grab an issue, of let us put Bill Kelty's plan into action&mdash;his pre-election statement that it will be war and there will be blood on the streets et cetera. So we have the ACTU using this bill to facilitate their own program to enable them to make a public plea for their own membership to try to increase their numbers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sometimes we really have to ask how sincere members opposite are in relation to any strike that might take place or their attitude towards this bill. I remember one particular hearing in Perth. At the start of this hearing Senator Mackay made an announcement to the inquiry that that day was a day of national strike action by the CPSU, and she announced to the inquiry that the hearing and the committee had been granted an exemption. She said she was a member of the CPSU and she and other members present who might be members of the CPSU could continue with the inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Mackay was the only member of the CPSU present that day. I urged her to join her comrades in solidarity if she thought the strike going on was justified, and I guaranteed that I would maintain a quorum for the rest of the day to allow her to do so. Did she join <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2889"> her comrades? Not on your life. No way in the world did she think the strike was justified enough that she should take part. So we had a situation where there was a national day of strike action and Senator Mackay, a member of the CPSU, did not feel obliged to take part.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, it was a sad day that this reference ever went to a references committee rather than a legislation committee. A legislation committee has the same powers to call witnesses. It has the same responsibility to ensure that legislation is looked into, and it would have been. The government gave that guarantee by saying that they would support this going to a legislation committee. But members opposite knew that by using the system they could use a references committee, where they had a majority&mdash;although they have a big minority in this place&mdash;to conduct this inquiry in the way they wanted it to be conducted; that is, they wanted it to be an inquiry managed by the ACTU and not by Labor senators opposite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our views have been expressed in the minority report, one of the largest minority reports that have been written for some time. The views of government members of this committee have been made quite clear in that report.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the contrary, many submissions were concerned that the regulation of minimum and maximum hours for part-time workers would no longer be allowed and that it was not clear that the 18 allowable award matters included scope to ensure that part-time work was regular. Women with family responsibilities need regular hours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As well, the experience of deregulation in other places shows that in general women and part-time workers do relatively poorly. Women negotiating agreements are more likely to agree to lower remuneration and accede to pressure to trade away family friendly conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I could cover many other issues: the abolition of paid rates awards, equal remuneration, less protection for industrial action, etc.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, I should refer briefly to the other reports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Democrats Member has included a Supplementary report, which provides further considerations on several issues, as foreshadowed in the executive summary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not surprisingly, the Government Members have made a dissenting report. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Regarding this report, I must say, with all due respect, on the brief opportunity I have had to scan its contents, it is clutching at straws. Just one example, page 249 shows this and highlights that the Prime Minister John Howard is not listening. Government senators failed to acknowledge the evidence from vast numbers of community groups, academics and legal firms etc. raising concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government cannot see or wishes to ignore, that many of the problems relate to that the Bill <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> starts from the assumption that employers and employees have equal bargaining power. The Bill's supporters claim that the move towards workplace bargaining and individual bargaining will be a win-win situation for all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The majority of the Committee regards this assumption as fundamentally flawed. Some employees may do well, many, particularly those in weak bargaining positions will do badly.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commend my supplementary report to the house and I hope that it will help contribute to the passage of a better workplace relations bill. I would like to precede my remarks by complimenting both our chair and our deputy chair for their conduct in the inquiry. I personally found that the manner in which the hearings were arranged and organised and the manner in which they were conducted were a credit to the Senate. I found that the way the senators conducted themselves throughout what was a very passionate inquiry was a credit to the Senate and reflected well on the independence and integrity of the people concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point I want to make is that I believe the opportunity for the presentation of individual submissions as well as submissions by organisations was particularly helpful. I think it was Senator Crane who first introduced that practice to the Senate and, once again, I would like to commend the house for the most democratic and appropriate way of touching the pulse of the people. My third introductory remark relates to the professionalism of our secretariat&mdash;they were just outstanding, quite frankly&mdash;and the diligence of the Hansard team was much appreciated by all of us, as Senator Ferguson has clearly outlined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My fourth point is that, most of all, this process put enormous pressure on all of us to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2891"> get on top of it, and to produce a tabled report like that within a month and a half is an outstanding activity. It does, however, necessarily result in the reproduction of some typos in our report. I am sure both sides of the house have some; we certainly do, and we plead for your indulgence for any typos you may pick up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My fifth and most important remark is that there have been questions as to whether this process was vindicated. Senator Ferguson has indicated that possibly it should have gone to another committee, but he has not said that it should not have gone out to the people. I think that is a very important concession from the government, because there is a view among some of the more hard&hyphen;headed that this was an exercise in futility. We as the Australian Democrats say that there was no other way in which we could have understood what people were saying and feeling and we ourselves took particular note of the submissions that were put to us from both sides of the argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We, too, believe that the coordination of submissions by the ACTU, the ACCI and the BCA were very helpful, and we do not regret that process one bit. But we should make note in our introductory remarks that one&hyphen;third of employers and one&hyphen;third of employees are represented by organisations, and it is the two&hyphen;thirds of employees and the two&hyphen;thirds of employers that the Australian Democrats have also tried to focus on&mdash;people who were not properly represented in submissions to the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that it is entirely appropriate for government to bring forward this workplace relations bill to correct and to improve inadequacies in existing legislation&mdash;inadequacies which were reflected in remarks both by employees and by employers. We do not hold to the view that the bill should not have been introduced and we do not hold to the view that it does not have some positive characteristics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats have broadly supported the government views on issues such as no compulsory unionism, on essential freedoms, on unfair dismissal reforms, on the potential usefulness of workplace agreements <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and on the introduction of the office of the employment advocate. We do, however, believe that the bill will need to be amended to provide a fairer balance between the rights of employees and the rights of employers rather than being stacked, as we think it still is, against weak and vulnerable workers, particularly women and young people. We will be seeking amendments to beef it up in that respect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats' recommendations flow from three key principles: the maintenance of a strong award system as an absolutely important protection for low income workers and for small businesses; the need for a strong and impartial umpire in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to protect employees and employers with weak bargaining power against those with excessive bargaining strength; and, most importantly from the government's point of view, we want to ensure that you do keep your election promises, particularly that no worker will be worse off and that the balance between work and family responsibilities will be improved. We are sure that we will get their cooperation in making sure that those promises are implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also need to ensure that the industrial relations system delivers the flexibility necessary for employers and employees who are capable of making a fair bargain to be able to do so freely and jointly at an enterprise level. That is an important acceptance. On these grounds we do reject proposals such as extending the scope of secondary boycott provisions to include consumer and environmental boycotts. We do oppose the excessive restrictions on the right of union officials to enter workplaces. We do oppose the watering down of the AIRC's powers to enforce equal remuneration for work of equal value and the abolition of paid rates awards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are prepared to support the thrust of the unfair dismissal reforms, the establishment of the employment advocate to assist the small business enterprise sector, in particular in enterprise bargaining, the accelerating of the modernisation of the award system and the ending of union closed shops and preference clauses. We particularly take note that the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2892"> submissions to us called for the award simplification to be made less legalistic, simpler to use, user friendly and independent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I would like to say that Australians in our view have a strong sense of fair play, and the committee has ensured that Australians had a fair go in having their say on the bill. The Australian Democrats will make sure that they have a fair go in the debate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be speaking briefly today in relation to this report from the Senate Economics References Committee on the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. There have been comments from the government today during the debate that, if the bill had been submitted to a legislative committee, the outcome would have been different. That is an interesting comment. There were some different members on that committee, and the assumption is quite right that people generally vote along party lines.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the problem with a legislative committee for this kind of inquiry: it does not actually reflect the voting power in the Senate. In reality, when parties do vote along party lines, they do not vote as, say, 38 members; they vote as one. That means it is important, when you have this kind of very controversial issue, that, as far as possible, the outcome should reflect the level of debate, the realities of the voting, the opinions and the ability for representation within the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been mention of an abuse of the Senate processes. I find that extraordinary because, while we were debating the reference of the committee in the first place, I mentioned the Senate's history and in fact the average length of Senate inquiries used to be longer than it has been in recent times. So by pushing for more bills to be simply put to a legislative committee, we are limiting the debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, on this issue, we were not just talking about what the implications of this bill were. It was important, in my opinion, to be able to look carefully and qualitatively at the comparisons between the Australian experience and that of overseas&mdash;and a great deal <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of evidence was taken in this committee in relation to the experience of various states' legislatures. This is extremely important because of the nature of this bill, which allows a movement between federal and state legislation in industrial relations, and because, if workers are vulnerable under the current situation, they will be even more vulnerable, in my opinion, if this new legislation goes through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I join others in commending the work done by the committee secretariat, the chair and the deputy chair. I would like to add a comment about one very good aspect about the conduct of this committee inquiry: the bill was placed on the Internet. Apparently, rather than reduce the number of sales of the bill at the government bookshops, this has increased the interest because people had access to see what the issues were. Some people, I was told, found it by accident: they were surfing the Internet and found workplace relations and thought, `Wow'. I believe that in the first couple of days there were about 37,000 visits to the Internet site.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think this is a very positive step and I am very sorry to see that the current government is limiting the access that people will have to Internet within the parliamentary process. It is a bit like the Telstra bill: it is basically going in the wrong direction and pretending that this technology does not exist and that the world is not going on, is not moving in a different direction. I am not a technophile but I do believe that there was a lot of excitement in the community at being able to have at least this access into the parliamentary process. I think that, because there were a number of visits, we should be thinking that this should be a regular part of the process. There was obviously a very high level of community interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was necessary to take the inquiry to the people and, personally, I think we should have had a greater level of community inquiry in the 1993 bill as well. It is true that unions have played a greater role in the process, but I also know that not everybody was gung&hyphen;ho happy about the bill in 1993. There were concerns in 1993 that there was a process of bad or worse, and many people felt it was <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2893"> necessary to try to make some protections against what were considered to be worse options in the case of Western Australia and some other states like Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a lot of personal evidence given to this inquiry, which has been very important. When people say, `Where in this legislation does it say that an employer can exploit an employee?', of course there is not going to be a workplace relations bill that says, `This bill allows an employer to exploit and behave unfairly or treat an employee unfairly.' Of course a bill does not say that, but that is why it was necessary to speak to the people who are in individual contracts, who are in different award situations and do not have the current protections that are available under the federal awards, to find out what their experience has been, how things work on the ground, with even the best of intentions, and that is being generous. The results were very disturbing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Greens have followed this issue carefully and will continue to do so in the committee stage of the bill. I think the process has been extremely important. We would not have served the process well if we had restricted the bill to a short committee of inquiry. The most appropriate process has been followed and it has extended the debate significantly to enable us all to make better decisions when we deal with the bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The arrangements have been changed by some devious means from what they were supposed to have been, namely: the chairman, the deputy chairman, you and me, Senator Murray and Senator Margetts. Nonetheless, I want to raise a number of matters about this inquiry. I begin by reinforcing what everybody else has said about the outstanding effort by Rob Diamond and his team, Sound and Vision, Hansard and all the others involved. This was an inquiry into the workplace relations bill and dealing <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> with conditions in the workplace. However, in Perth, we had Hansard sitting there for five hours before opposition senators called for a toilet break. I found that one of the ironies of this particular inquiry. Even though it was a long and hard process, those very important little courtesies were hard won.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What came through the inquiry was that when you deal with matters the bad is never as bad as the doomsday merchants claim it will be and nor are the boons as great as the optimists claim they will be. Although there were a number of notable submissions, because of the orchestration there was continuous misrepresentation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the report by government senators on the committee we have endeavoured to put the other side of the positions that were put in that orchestration. As I was probably the key author, I spent a lot of time on the report. I particularly refer people to read chapter 2 on the two sides to the story.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also refer to the amount of repetition in the submissions. We even had three submissions where the first 40 pages were virtually the same word for word&mdash;and you can relate that to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. This aspect follows on from what my colleague said earlier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was important that the committee did get around Australia. Nonetheless, it should have been done through the legislation committee which could have conducted exactly the same hearings and gone to the same places. Then we would have kept the processes that were put in place in forming the legislation and references committees to do that work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Interestingly, to the day exactly the same amount of time was given for this inquiry as was given for the 1993 inquiry&mdash;and I served on both of them. Many of the stories were the same. Of course, there were variations between the submissions. But, once again, because there was no orchestration by the ACTU at those hearings in 1993, the only part of the union movement that appeared was the ACTU itself, which I thought put in a very good submission in representing the particular views of the union movement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the repetition we gained very little extra in what was said. In reading each <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2894"> submission you get almost exactly the same story. I concede there was some variation but, once again, the same could be said about the employers' submissions, except for one aspect: this time they dealt with the situations which exist in the various states. Let me tell you that it was not all doom and gloom as some people would like us to believe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure that, if opposition members had been aware of what was going to happen last Monday, they would not have gone ahead with this inquiry in the form that it took. I do not believe that we would have seen the attempts to come into the hearings with placards and to have the mini&hyphen;demonstrations within the hearing forum. I pay particular compliment and credit to Rob Diamond for the way that he handled those people who brought in the placards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On this side of the chamber we welcome people attending those or any hearings. However, because such hearings are an extension of the Senate, the behaviour must be exactly the same as that allowed in the public gallery here. It would not have happened if there had been a few wise words from the people involved and who knew what was going on. I want to put that on the public record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I repeat: if you people on the other side of the chamber had known how badly your rally was going to go wrong last Monday, you would not have gone ahead with it in the manner in which you did. At the end of the day, you will be judged very unkindly, as will the ACTU, for the assault that occurred on Parliament House last Monday. Make no mistake about it. That rally was intended to relate to the presentation this week of this particular bill in this chamber. I say to you people: shame on you for not keeping a little more control over what occurred; it was an assault on democracy in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I can deal with some aspects of this: I have worked on both sides&mdash;I have been an employee and an employer. As I have said in this place before, I shore around shearing sheds in Western Australia for 20 years so I have a pretty good idea, in a practical sense, of good employers and good employees. That was highlighted in these hearings in terms of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the good and bad. My life experience&mdash;and I have never heard anybody dispute this&mdash;is that 99 per cent of employers are damned good employers and damned good people and 99 per cent of employees are good people and damned good workers. They organise themselves in the workplace in a very good, positive and strong manner. They get on well together and do an outstanding job. It does not matter what legislation you put in place in terms of dealing with that, you will not change that factor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What amazed me in terms of these submissions, laid against this bill which is before us now, is that we had complaints of malpractice in the workplace going back 15 years. Can you believe it? Can I also say that one of the very disappointing aspects of it for me was the performance of some of the academics and lawyers. When you have people appear before you and you ask the question, `Have you read the bill?' and the answer is, `I glanced at it,' or, in one case that we highlight in our government senators report, `No,' you start to ask questions about the credibility of those people and the damage they do to this process. It does no good to them or the process we went through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, when dealing with the issue of right of entry in Brisbane a witness there, who from memory was a member of one of the maritime or seafarers unions&mdash;I just want to use this as an example&mdash;made reference to the right of entry. I said, `Have you read the other sections with regard to the right of entry?' He said, `No,' and then went on to explain&mdash;which I did not pick up at the time&mdash;that less than 24 hours ago he had got back from a ship. He had not read the bill or the submission that had been prepared and put before him, in terms of the position. That does not do the process any good.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to say in conclusion that I certainly appreciated working with all the people on the committee in what was a very strenuous 18 days of hearings, and for most of us another six or seven days of travelling. We kept ourselves in good humour and good spirit, and we worked very well together. I say that to the Labor Party people, particularly Senator Murray in his first excursion into <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2895"> this type of thing and to my colleagues Senator Chapman and Senator Ferguson. That was one of the outstanding parts of this inquiry but it is unfortunate the way it went because it was flawed from the start. It is a tragedy that it ended up the way it did last Monday alongside the Great Hall of Parliament House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make some brief comments on the quality of the government's minority report. Before I do, I would like to analyse briefly the breakdown of the submissions received by the committee. This committee received 1,398 submissions in total: 180 from unions, 90 from community groups and academics, 44 from employers and employer organisations, 14 from law firms and organisations made up of lawyers, and over 1,000 from individuals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of the 44 received from employers and employer groups, 39 supported the bill, three had major concerns about the bill and two opposed the bill. Of the 14 received from law firms, 12 opposed the bill, one had major concerns about the bill and one supported the bill. Of the 12 submissions received from academics, 10 opposed the bill, one had major concerns about the bill and one supported the bill&mdash;guess who? It was Judith Sloan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Coming to community groups, not one supported the bill in total. Every single community group expressed major concerns with aspects of this bill. As you can see from what I have just said, this did not give the government much to work with when they sat down and prepared their minority report&mdash;but never let the facts get in the way of a good story. The government's minority report largely consists of great slabs of quotes from the small number of groups that supported the bill, not to mention great slabs of quotes from government senators&mdash;but I will come to that a bit later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said before, 42 employer groups supported the bill. If you have only 42 submissions that are supporting you out of 1,398, you need to make maximum mileage out of what they said. Nobody could accuse the government of not doing that. Let's go through a breakdown of the government's <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> evidence. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry get quoted quite a bit&mdash;seven times in fact. Hamersley Iron are quoted quite a bit&mdash;also seven times. The Western Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry get a guernsey four times and the National Farmers Federation are also there four times. The Housing Industry Association get mentioned three times and the Business Council of Australia do a bit better with five mentions. The Australian Chamber of Manufactures and the Australian Hotels Association are mentioned three times and the Master Builders Association are mentioned twice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The poor old MTIA only got a go once, probably because they had major concerns with aspects of the bill. The Victorian Automobile Chamber of Commerce were also mentioned only once, for the same reason, and we finish with the Australian Retailers Association which similarly get mentioned only once for their temerity in having concerns with the bill. This adds up to 42 out of 1,398 submissions&mdash;not enough, think the government. So what do they do? To substantiate their case and pad out the report they then quote&mdash;wait for it&mdash;the Department of Industrial Relations. The fact that the department, at the minister's direction, wrote the bill should not really bring into question their impartiality, according to the government. I suppose that if you are scratching around and clutching at straws, you do not have much option than to quote your own department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, never let it be alleged that this government does not think that the minority report is not balanced. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission gets an acknowledgment even though it had grave concerns with this bill. Women for Workplace Justice get two acknowledgments, although they also had grave concerns with this bill. Judith Sloan predictably gets two mentions. But that is still not enough, says the government. So what do they do? They start using the rhetoric of their own senators as evidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me give you a couple of examples. Let us look at supporting evidence for the fact that this bill will remove set hours for part&hyphen;time workers. And who do we see quoted in evidence? We see Senator Chapman. Let us <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2896"> look at the extract of Ms Andrades, Spokesperson for Women for Workplace Justice. This is with Senator Chapman. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senator Chapman</EMPHASIS> &mdash;You also raised the issue of part&hyphen;time work. Is it not a fact that under the current legislation we have the problem that part&hyphen;time work is developing apace on a casual basis? Casual part&hyphen;time workers will increase from about 17 per cent to 24 per cent, most directly because of the current restrictions that exist on permanent part&hyphen;time work within the award structure. Instead of people moving into permanent part&hyphen;time work where they get pro rata&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is what we are talking about when we say that if you do not limit the number of part&hyphen;time workers or casual workers, adverse consequences can follow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senator Chapman</EMPHASIS> &mdash;On the contrary. That removes the restriction that currently exists on permanent part&hyphen;time work. As a consequence of that current restriction, you are getting a massive growth in casual work. It has gone from about 17 per cent to 24 cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Ms Andrades</EMPHASIS> &mdash;As far as I am aware, there is no restriction in the current act on numbers of permanent part&hyphen;time workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senator Chapman</EMPHASIS> &mdash;There is in a number of awards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Ms Andrades</EMPHASIS> &mdash;That is a different question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senator Chapman</EMPHASIS> &mdash;This legislation is removing those restrictions so that people can get permanent part&hyphen;time work and get the pro rata benefits.</PARA>
<PARA>That extract was actually used in evidence to support the government's decision on part&hyphen;time work. We will go to Senator Chapman again. Now just in case we missed it the first time around, Senator Chapman gets another go in the minority report, this time to Mr Michael Brown from the shop assistants' union. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senator Chapman</EMPHASIS> &mdash;You also raised the issue of part&hyphen;time work. Is it not a fact that under the current legislation we have the problem that part&hyphen;time work is developing apace on a casual basis?</PARA>
<PARA>This may start sounding familiar to senators.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Casual part&hyphen;time workers will increase from about 17 per cent to 24 per cent, most directly because of the current restrictions that exist on permanent part&hyphen;time work within the award structure. Instead of people moving into permanent part&hyphen;time work where they get pro rata provision of benefits that full&hyphen;time workers get, their work force has been casualised on a part&hyphen;time basis and they are in fact thereby disadvantaged. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>Blah, blah, blah.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This legislation will allow for greater scope for permanent part&hyphen;time work and therefore the provision of those pro rata benefits to employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr Brown</EMPHASIS> &mdash;That may very well be the case, but there are no part&hyphen;time workers in my department. Certainly, we would be disadvantaged if we were to become part&hyphen;time workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senator Chapman</EMPHASIS> &mdash;No&hyphen;one is suggesting that you will become part&hyphen;time workers. The intent of this of this legislation is that those people who are currently part&hyphen;time workers on a casual basis will be able to become part&hyphen;time workers with permanency and therefore with the pro rata benefits that apply to permanent part&hyphen;time work which do not apply to casual part&hyphen;time work.</PARA>
<PARA>Neither witness seemed to be particularly impressed, as you can see, with Senator Chapman's logic. However, Senator Chapman was not the only government senator to get a go. The following lengthy dissertation from Senator Crane gets used as evidence in relation to the setting of pay issues. These extracts are actually used to substantiate the government's position, the government's bill. They are using their own senators as evidence. This is addressed to Mr Stewart&hyphen;Crompton from the Department of Industrial Relations. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senator Crane</EMPHASIS> &mdash;Thank you for clearing up that point. There is one last point that I want to raise on this, one that I have raised a number of times during the hearing. I would like to hear the department's view on this. It relates to&mdash;within the allowable matters&mdash;the responsibility of the Commission and Section 89A(2)(b) and onwards, which refers to ordinary time hours of work. Subsection 2(c) refers to rates of pay generally while subsection 2(d) refers to piece rates, tallies, et cetera. I will not read it all out because I am sure you are more familiar with it than I am&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and he probably would be because he probably participated in the drafting of the bill&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and everybody at this table has heard it a few times.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The point I am coming to relates to the underpinning of the various methods of employment provided in this Bill by those particular clauses from the point of view of wages or payment. We then go to 170LG, minimum conditions, which states:</PARA>
<PARA>Then he quotes that section. And Senator Crane continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Then it goes on and deals with a number of sections&mdash;170XF, 17010G, et cetera, which I will <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2897"> not go through. But it refers to pieceworkers, casual employers, casual pieceworkers, et cetera. As far as I am aware, looking at this particular Bill and each component of employment,&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and this is supposed to be a question, incidentally&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">you go back to the underpinning of what they will be paid and back to those clauses there, which are set by the Commission in terms of negotiating or coming to that particular position.</PARA>
<PARA>Now wait for it; we are coming to the question:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I just wanted to get confirmation from you regarding my understanding&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>in terms of what he had just said&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">of the provisions as to setting of pay. Whether it be a casual worker, a piece worker, somebody employed under an agreement, a certified agreement, et cetera, it has to come back to those standards that are set to the relevant award.</PARA>
<PARA>Now that was the question. The answer from Mr Stewart&hyphen;Crompton was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is correct, Senator.</PARA>
<PARA>Now what is the government's conclusion after all this? `In summary having considered the written submissions and the evidence given during public hearings, there is clear community support for the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill'. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<STATE> (South Australia)</STATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Acting Deputy President, I rise to support this legislation and to place on record both the opposition's support for it and the opposition's concerns about a number of aspects of not only the legislation but also the government's response to the events which occurred at Port Arthur just a few months ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We see this bill as the next important step in the introduction of uniform national gun <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2900"> laws. It is worth placing on record that much of the work that has been reflected in the outcome from discussions since the Port Arthur massacre has been built on the work that was done in the previous government by my colleagues the then Attorney&hyphen;General, Michael Lavarch, and particularly by the then Minister for Justice, Duncan Kerr. The nuts and bolts of the uniform gun laws legislation, the whole raft of measures that go to questions of licensing, classification and every other aspect of the legislation, bar one, were being prepared by the previous Minister for Justice in particular. That one exemption, of course, is the extension of the ban from what was proposed before Port Arthur to now cover the semi&hyphen;automatic weapons that are being covered in this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is reflected in this legislation is an approach to national gun laws that was, in fact, being prepared before the election. This bill appropriates money to the states for the purposes of the firearms buyback and to compensate gun dealers for loss of business. The bill will also compensate the states for the cost of implementing the resolution as agreed to by the Australian council of police ministers on 10 May 1996 and 17 July 1996. It is a fundamental piece of legislation which provides the umbrella statutory power for the scheme to be implemented. In endorsing the scheme, we support the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there are a number of concerns that we have with the bill. These matters have been raised with the government, but the government has chosen not to support them. That is unfortunate, but it is the case. Our overriding objective in this particular process was to maintain a spirit of bipartisanship. As I said the day after Port Arthur, the opposition was keen to enter into a bipartisan arrangement with the government to ensure that the combined strengths of the major parties and other parties in this place would mean that those who would otherwise want to blackmail government into one position or another would have to take on the whole political process. I think that bipartisan approach has been important so far. It is that bipartisan approach which leads us to raise issues of concern today. But, once again, with the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> objective of not trying to blow away that bipartisanship, we will not move amendments to affect, in particular, the agreements of the council of police ministers of the dates that I mentioned earlier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a number of concerns. They are worth placing on record because I think the government may have to address them down the track. The first concern that we have is in respect of the amount of compensation to be paid by the Commonwealth to the states for implementation of the scheme. Our understanding is that compensation originally agreed to would cover some two&hyphen;thirds to three&hyphen;quarters of the costs incurred by the states, and we are concerned at recent suggestions that the government may seek to squib on this commitment and provide only some 50 per cent of the costs. That, of course, would be contrary to the expectations of state ministers and would throw a barb in the successful implementation of these reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is my understanding that there is a commitment from the office of the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) that the limit will only be set once agreements have been reached with the states and territories. What I would like from Senator Vanstone as the representative of the Attorney-General is an undertaking to the effect that any agreement on the amount of compensation will be consistent with both the letter and the spirit of the resolutions agreed to by the police ministers; and, further, that the limit will only be set once an agreement has been reached with each and every state and territory, in accordance with the above terms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is an important factor to place on the table at the moment. Any weaseling out by the Commonwealth on commitments given in terms of cost coverage for the states is something we would be concerned about&mdash;not just because it may be seen to be a breach of commitment, but also because it may inject into this process a bit of ill will which is quite unnecessary and could be quite damaging to the way the scheme is implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other major concern we have is one that emanates from the way this issue has been handled in my home state, the state of South Australia. It is of real concern that in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2901"> that state the pressure from the backbench of the Liberal government has meant that the government has had to make concessions which are not in the national interest, concessions which do in some respects undermine the national operation of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For instance, South Australia has sought an exemption from the national amnesty, which is to apply until 30 September 1997. Instead, for South Australia the amnesty will be in effect only until the end of this year. That, of course, throws it out of kilter with the rest of Australia. It will lead to a situation where, whilst it will be illegal to own a prohibited firearm all around Australia in the new year, you will be safe from prosecution in every part of Australia until 30 September 1997&mdash;with the exception of South Australia. That could create problems, for instance, with people who move to South Australia during this period not knowing of the different law that will apply there. Those problems are obvious.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what concerns me is that the reason for the difference in timing demanded by South Australia is not so obvious, other than, as I say, unreasonable irrational pressure from the backbench of the government in the state of South Australia. I would have liked&mdash;and I am sure the Commonwealth would have liked&mdash;to have seen a scheme operating consistently across the country. But, as I say, in South Australia, for some irrational reason, the state government has chosen not to stay in line with the national response.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The direct impact of this is that the buy-back scheme will only apply in South Australia for a more limited period. Our concern is that, whereas all other states and the Commonwealth Attorney-General have deemed it appropriate to have a longer period to maximise the scheme's impact, in my home state it will not be able to operate for as long as we would have liked it to. We would have preferred the South Australian exemption not to have been agreed to by the police ministers. The result, as I say, is contrary to the principle of having a national gun law. But, because we are keen not to reopen the agreed position of the ministers, we raise our concerns at this stage and, of course, urge <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> South Australia to reconsider its irrational position on this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second problem with South Australia is an even more important one&mdash;and I do not know what has been driving the South Australian response in these matters apart from, as I say, irrationality on the backbench. South Australia will be the only state in the Commonwealth that will not compensate owners of unregistered prohibited firearms. This is bad policy&mdash;and it is so for a number of reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For a start, unregistered prohibited weapons are the weapons that we most want to remove from the streets. Registered weapons can always be tracked down. But it is the unregistered ones that are most likely to be the ones that we want to remove from action, and these are the ones that the South Australian response will ensure are not brought forward. An amnesty covering as wide a range of weapons as possible is desirable; an amnesty covering unregistered prohibited weapons is something which we would have thought would have been essential. But South Australia has chosen not to go this far.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is even more irrational because the Commonwealth is footing the compensation bill for these weapons. As a result of the passage of this act, there is no cost in terms of compensation for the buy back of weapons to be incurred by the state of South Australia. So I have to ask the Premier of South Australia, `Why aren't you going as far as the rest of Australia? Why are you allowing this loophole for South Australia, particularly when it will cost you nothing?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The concern is there, the concern is real and the concern is that, because of the gutlessness of the Brown government, the firearms that we most want removed from our streets will not be picked up in South Australia. It is of concern to South Australians; it should also be of concern in the national interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst the Attorney-General and the Commonwealth authorities have complained to South Australia about this position, I would have liked to have had this issue forced upon that state, particularly given the fact that the other states have agreed to the extension to cover unregistered prohibited weapons. Once <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2902"> again, we would have supported an amendment to the bill effectively to force South Australia to provide compensation to all firearm owners. But to have done that, I think, would have led to a reopening of the arrangement at a critical time of the arrangement's implementation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will now discuss the federal government's response to the wider issues emanating from Port Arthur. We obviously agree with the response of the government which has given us uniform national gun laws. But we need to look at two other matters that have arisen out of Port Arthur, and we need to look at them in the context of what could have been a broader and more visionary response to this particular problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had instances in the past with Hoddle Street and Queen Street, and there were responses to those&mdash;and I will go to them in a few minutes. But the federal government's response here has gone to national gun laws, it has gone to review and tightening of censorship guidelines and review of the national mental health strategy. My concern is that these are issues that were chosen more because of their populism than because of good broad visionary policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In terms of censorship, there was some concern straight after the massacre that Mr Bryant had in his possession some 2,000 allegedly violent videos. As a consequence, newspapers reacted very strongly to that and claims were made that we would need to tighten up our censorship laws because they caused Port Arthur. But, with the exception of three or four videos, the rest of those 2,000 were predominantly 1930s and 1940s musicals&mdash;the Shirley Temples, the Fred and Gingers, the Judy Garlands and so on. A knee-jerk response was something that we could have done without at that particular time. Yes, we have embarked upon a review of censorship laws but we should not allow ourselves to act as cultural cops when we in the Senate revisit the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another concern is that we targeted mental health when all the evidence seems to indicate that, despite the popular media response at the time, Mr Bryant was not a schizophrenic. When the Queen Street and Hoddle Street <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> massacres occurred, the then federal government set up a National Committee on Violence. That committee gave some 140 recommendations on how our society could tackle the issues of violence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those recommendations went to the following: organised crime; the use of drugs, legal and illegal; providing family infrastructure; providing education and support services to parents to provide safer family environments, recognising that all too often violence is within the family; resourcing anti-violence education campaigns; looking at domestic and family violence; and helping people with intellectual disabilities. There was a whole raft of measures going to the problems of youth, accommodation, access and support for conflict resolution services, and so on. The committee was also looking at the treatment of issues of violence in schools and in the workplace with responses such as education and training opportunities; looking at producing Commonwealth laws to tackle domestic violence and relationship breakdowns; and looking at training police forces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I am saying is that, when those massacres took place, the government at the time took a broad response. We said, `Well, let us recognise that the sorts of underlying problems that bring about the Port Arthurs and the Queen and Hoddle streets are not just simplistic ones; they are not just superficial ones. They go to the very fabric of society and of family problems.' My concern is that we could at this particular stage of our development have revisited the National Committee on Violence agenda and made an assessment of how far we have progressed since then and of how we need to build on that agenda. But we have not done that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is a lost opportunity for Australia that we have not revisited the broad spectrum of issues and tried to build on the government action of the past. Instead, what have we done? We have, in fact, cut back on some of the most critical areas that go to law enforcement and control of violence in our society. In the last 48 hours, we have seen cutbacks in a raft of law enforcement areas which are quite unreasonable in the circumstances in which the particular organisations that have <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2903"> been affected are having to meet them. It is also unreasonable in terms of the growing incidence of not just crime but organised crime in our society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> When you look at what this government has done in recent days to the resource capacity of the National Crime Authority&mdash;particularly when it means that for my state of South Australia and for Western Australia in particular the resources will be about one-third of what they have been in the past&mdash;there will be cutbacks of some $11 million over the next three years. Cuts have been made to the Australian Federal Police&mdash;an organisation which is stretched in its capacity already; an organisation which has to meet growing demands; and an organisation which, together with the NCA and Customs, will have added responsibilities as we go towards the year 2000 Olympics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Cutbacks to Customs will mean that our borders will not be checked as well as they have been, as well as they could be and as well as they need to be. Overall, some $130 million over the next four years will be cut back from our law enforcement capacity. I think that is something that this government will find very hard to justify as part of this nation's response to illegality and violence in our society. Not only do we find ourselves having lost the opportunity to build on the social policy response but also we find that, at a time when we need to build our resources against particularly the organised crime part of our society, those resources have had a monumental cutback.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Returning to the legislation, let me say that the opposition supports it. We recognise that the response of the government has been a strong one. We also recognise that we have a role to play in maintaining our bipartisan support for the legislation to ensure that we do not go down the American road when it comes to the use of guns in our society. At the same time, we do say to the government that this has been a lost opportunity in terms of how we could have broached other underlying issues in our society. Not only is it a lost opportunity but also it comes at a time when the government's ideological fixation on cutting back the capacity of federal govern ment means that our law enforcement agencies&mdash;agencies with their primary role being to protect families in our society&mdash;will be cut at the knees in terms of their capacity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In closing, can I say that we commend the government for going this far. The legislation is important. I am sure that, as we proceed towards the year 2000 and thereafter, the Australian public will be grateful that this legislation is on the statute books and that this parliament has been able to come together&mdash;to put political issues aside, to put party politicking aside&mdash;and agree to a bill which, despite some problems, is a major step forward for gun control in any Western society.</PARA></SPEECH>

We congratulate the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), and, indeed, all our federal leaders, who are showing such a united front in support of gun control, as well as the state and territory premiers and all those other Australians who have worked so hard to ensure that these essential reforms are adopted.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senator TAMBLING</EMPHASIS> (Northern Territory&mdash;Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development) <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2905"> (11.48 a.m.)&mdash;Last evening when we were debating these airport bills, I had already responded to the comments of the Senate committee report on this important airports legislation and to the comments Senator Bob Collins made on behalf of the Australian Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the interruption of the debate, I was responding to the comments Senator Woodley made on behalf of the Australian Democrats. We had reached the point of talking about competition between airports. I had indicated that the government was going to do all that it could to encourage competition, but that it would in a direct sense occur only at the margin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nevertheless, that margin can be vital, as Senator Calvert observed. Even Senator Bob Collins implied that Alice Springs, Launceston and even Melbourne do see themselves in competition with other airports. You only have to pick up any newspaper to see that Victorians are desperate to allow themselves to own their own airport and compete with Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Woodley raised the issue of the Federal Airports Corporation's profit. Yes, the FAC has done an excellent job in earning a profit, although its rate of return is not as powerful as he suggested. In part, this is because its assets remain undervalued. For example, the runways in Brisbane are on the books at only $25 million. So its returns are inflated by a low asset base. It is obvious that Democrat economics would not get past the auditor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say that the sale is not a punishment for the FAC, rather it is a culmination of a job well done. There is no longer a development need for local airports requiring cross&hyphen;subsidies of the kind referred to by Senator Bob Collins. The network approach has done its job. It is now time to harness the innovation skill of the private sector to take over the asset and improve services to the travelling public in the same way as private airports in the United Kingdom and elsewhere in Europe have done. We can be sure that services will improve because this bill allows service standards to be established and used as a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> means of scrutinising the performance of new operators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Calvert raised the issue of local government rates being paid by on&hyphen;airport businesses. Currently, this is done by discretion by the FAC. Under the leases to be offered to private purchasers, this obligation should be picked up by the new lessee. I appreciate that Senator Calvert's concerns for the challenges to Tasmanians are particularly on behalf of the tourist industry that he is so closely associated with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Margetts foreshadowed amendments in relation to environmental issues at airports. The government has indicated a preparedness to consider these up to a point. It will be interesting to see at the committee stage how effective these changes are likely to prove. I think some are not wise from an environmental point of view, and we have attempted to provide advice on these.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope it will be recognised that giving states the ability to override Commonwealth environmental standards is not traditionally what green groups have sought and that seems singularly inappropriate here. Making the task of regulating to support environment standards difficult and riddled with delay is also less than helpful to the management of environment issues at airports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Crane outlined how effective the Senate committee process has been. This puts great credit on the positive approach taken by the government to the committee process in the Senate. Indeed, some of the issues raised here could and should have been given an airing in the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee rather than being rushed in at the last minute yesterday and perhaps today in the committee stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Murphy wants to ensure that local bodies can control airports. We too have an interest in this area. As I noted yesterday in comments on Senator Bob Collins's remarks, I have spoken to the Tasmanian local government representatives and found them very understanding of the government's desire to have an open tender process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me turn to the comments by Senator Harradine, who wanted to ensure that proper <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2906"> oversight of prices occurs. I can assure him that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission will put a strong focus on constraining aeronautical prices to keep them below the consumer price index over the next five years. Airport operators will definitely not be able to charge what the market will bear. Prices to airlines, their customers and the travelling public will fall in real terms over the five years. The only remaining question is: how far?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will not be regulating immediately to assure this. We have seen the Prices Surveillance Authority work well without mandatory regulation power prior to its incorporation into the ACCC. We believe that operators will respect the ACCC's view. If not, however, the government has said in the paper on pricing at airports, which is currently circulating and which was provided to the committee, that we reserve the right to impose by legislation the pricing policy if the ACCC believes that to be necessary. Thus the intent of Senator Harradine's concern is met. I can give him an assurance to this effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Harradine also raised the issue of local government taxation applying to leases. We have already indicated an intention to ensure that leases reflect this. As well, Senator Harradine wanted to have our views on local ownership. I have already indicated that we share an interest and are considering options in this area within the context of an open bidding contest. I use the specific examples of Launceston and Hobart.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, Senator Harradine raised the aerodrome local ownership program. In committee hearings, departmental representatives indicated that no ALOP existed anymore. A future policy question will be whether the equivalent of such a scheme can be applied to the airport lease sales. Obviously, if bidding interest is not strong and local communities remain interested in taking over ownership, the government does not rule out any option for the future. I can go no further than that at this point in time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also appreciate the interest that all senators, including Senator Calvert and Senator MacGibbon, gave to addressing the very <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> important considerations in this regard and to supporting this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now turn to the amendment that has been moved by Senator Bob Collins for the opposition. That second reading amendment is in four parts, entitled (a), (b), (c) and (d). The first tenet of Senator Collins's amendment relates to the effort to ensure that the local community acquires the lease. I mentioned this issue in my response to Senator Harradine, but I would like to add a bit to it. The government has made clear its position on local community involvement in the leasing of airports other than major capital city airports. I mention, however, that I do not recall the previous government, the Labor government, suggesting this approach under its own proposals when we were considering them for the leasing of airports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second tenet, part (b), of Senator Collins's amendment relates to the diversity of ownership issue. The government has also made its position on this issue quite clear. There will be separation of ownership and control of Sydney with Sydney West from Melbourne and Sydney again with Sydney West from Brisbane. This will ensure that there is no private sector monopoly of the major airports on the eastern seaboard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government considers that the powers of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, coupled with the provisions of the Airports Bill, are more than adequate to protect the interests of the community and airport users. While the smaller airports effectively do not compete with each other or larger airports, the government, in conducting the leasing processes, will have regard to the support various parties have expressed for diversity of ownership being achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third tenet of Senator Collins's amendment relates to the EIS guidelines for the proposed Holsworthy site. I indicate that the government remains committed to building Sydney a second major airport of full international standard as a matter of priority, subject to the results of an environmental impact statement. In Labor's 13 years in power, they achieved nothing for a second airport. They fast&hyphen;talked and slow&hyphen;tracked development of an inadequate overflow airport development. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2907"> While Badgerys Creek remains the preferred site, the government considers it prudent to consider Holsworthy as an alternative in case Badgerys Creek proves to be environmentally unacceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is committed to a thorough, objective and transparent EIS process with extensive consultation and independent auditing consistent with the recommendations of the 1995 Senate Select Committee on Aircraft Noise in Sydney. The draft EIS guidelines will be finalised by the EPA after considering all comments by interested parties. I will certainly arrange for the issues raised in this debate to be referred to the Minister for the Environment, Senator Hill&mdash;in fact, I already did so yesterday in discussions with him&mdash;and the EPA for full consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say that the development of runway configurations and master plans is being addressed as a matter of priority. It is envisaged that the output from this consultancy will be made publicly available and will of course be a key input into the EIS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth and final point of Senator Collins's amendment is that the government should not proceed with the sale of leases at Kingsford Smith and Sydney West airports. The target is to issue a draft EIS by early 1997. All comments received on the draft EIS will then be fully considered and further information incorporated where required before the final EIS is prepared. The government will then be considering issues associated with the proposed airport based on the EIS and financial feasibility studies. The government will be giving further consideration to the leasing of Sydney and Sydney West airports once the site and scale of the development have been resolved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is certainly not attracted to supporting the amendment proposed by Senator Collins. In fact, we encourage all senators to look at the very close and clear objectives that have been outlined for this legislation, to reject the opposition amendment and to then fully support the proper and principal proposals that have been put forward in both of these pieces of legislation&mdash;the Airports Bill 1996 and the associated bill.</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This Act commences on the day after the day on which a written agreement, signed by representatives of all local government councils which are located within a 20 kilometre radius of Sydney (Kingsford Smith) or Sydney West Airports, and certifying that a satisfactory plan to provide for equitable sharing of the noise and air traffic burden over Sydney and implementation in a way that cannot result in an inequitable or onerous noise burden in the future has been agreed to, is laid before both Houses of Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA>The Airports (Transitional) Bill is a technical bill to transfer ownership. However, it is important to deal with some of the issues in bringing on the commencement of the bill in general.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year the coalition while in opposition effectively scuttled the ALP's airports transitional bill by putting an amendment that said management at Sydney airport could not be sold until the noise problem was resolved and the noise burden shared equitably. There is no such measure in this bill. Presumably, the coalition believe they have solved the noise problem in Sydney and the noise burden is now equitably shared. This may be news to the residents of Sydney. Personally, I do not think the noise problem has been solved. It has certainly not been solved to the satisfaction of people who live under the flight paths.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition, by discarding its own amendment, has shown itself to be hypocritical. The amendment last year was obviously a spoiling tactic not designed in any way to actually address the problems of the real people who are suffering. All the tears shed by the coalition may have been crocodile tears and, now they are in power, the amendment has gone. The concern for the people of Sydney is not very much evident and you are ready to sacrifice them for the pleasure of selling off public assets.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2909">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My amendment asks you to take cognisance of your own words&mdash;your own supposed concern&mdash;to behave with integrity and to put your money where your mouth is. The amendment simply says that this bill will not commence and that you cannot sell off the airports until you have demonstrated that you have worked to solve the Sydney noise problem, or done it as equitably as possible. It requires you to do exactly what you as an opposition demanded the former government should do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My amendment goes a bit beyond yours. For one thing, I ask that you not only attempt to solve the problem in the present but work out a way to ensure the problem is not simply deferred and that you solve it permanently. I ask that you solve it to the satisfaction of the real stakeholders, not to the satisfaction of government, parliament or the Treasury. The real stakeholders are not the Treasury or the buyers who hope to make money from this. The real stakeholders are the people who must live under the planes. I ask you to work to solve the problem to the satisfaction of the councils that lie under the flight paths.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Your amendment said the government should not sell the Sydney airport until they have solved the problem. Mine says you should not sell the management of any airport until you have solved this. I believe that, if you cannot solve the Sydney problem, you will not be able to solve the Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth or any other noise problem that may arise.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you sell management of these other airports, even if you do not sell Sydney, the problem will eventually arise and you will have no model to resolve them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was concerned during the original debate, and put it on record, that we were only dealing with it as if it was a problem in one part of the country. It was defining itself in one part of the country but we had not worked out mechanisms to deal with it in any other part of the country either. There are problems of compensation, noise and safety everywhere there is an airport. Once you go to the point of privatising it, dealing with those issues becomes extremely difficult unless you have a management plan to do so.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you can work a plan to solve the problem of Sydney, you will have a model for resolution. Both state and territory government, local government and the lessee companies will have a good idea of what to expect, which is fair, and you will be able to plan ahead to make resolution of future problems easier and less expensive. Sydney is therefore a test case. If you cannot resolve this problem, I do not believe that you should be allowed to recreate it under a regime where government has even less control&mdash;that is, after we have sold the leases to the airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment is simple and modelled on your own. It says that the noise burden must be equitably shared and that it must be clear to councils that this equity can be maintained and that equity does not mean equal but increasing pain but, rather, that the noise problem should not become too onerous. It requires you to get the agreement of councils whose bounds lie within a circle of a 20kilometre radius of the airport and to table that agreement in parliament before this bill, which allows the sale of airport management, can commence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend this amendment to the coalition and Democrats who put forward and voted for a similar amendment last year. But, in my opinion, the amendment last year was hastily written and perhaps had implications for safety which this specifically does not because it deals with working out a plan. It does not specify the plan regardless of safety. It says `. . . to work out a plan which is agreeable' and it looks at a plan for the future, which means that you can factor in safety as part of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Providing noise insulation should acknowledge that the noise problem is significant. It is a potential problem in any large city and should be resolved prior to relinquishing control and responsibility. There are other amendments to the Airports Bill which I will be putting later which deal with the specifics of noise management. However, this, I believe, should provide a model to deal with the future and not just Sydney. We are dealing with every FAC airport in the country and we are dealing with proposed increases in traffic which may increase the noise and traffic <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2910"> burden to a great extent in many parts of the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People need to be assured that there might be some model to which to work to resolve these problems in a consultative way. And that is what I am asking today, that there be some accepted model and that there is some confidence in the community that they will be part of this process.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I know, Senator, but I am part of a team here. It does, in fact, scuttle the bill. I have to say, Senator, with the greatest respect, that I would like to see you get a written agreement between all of the local government councils located within a 20&hyphen;kilometre radius of Sydney on garbage disposal, or indeed on anything else. I think that would be quite a challenge.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In equitably sharing the noise burden around all of those councils, you would have some amazing flight paths around Sydney airport. They would look something like the magic maze at the Darwin show. It would be a little bit difficult, I think, for the 737s to turn corners quite as sharply as that. It would certainly provide a thrill for the passengers on board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment&mdash;and I know Senator Margetts knows it&mdash;is simply putting up a proposition that would never be achieved. In that sense, the key point of this amendment is not noise; it is getting written agreement from all the councils in a 20&hyphen;kilometre radius to anything. I do not think that is achievable.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Collins has indicated, this amendment is simply not achievable. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> It is unlikely that there would ever be written agreement on any matter which could be signed by all local government councils within a 20&hyphen;kilometre radius of Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport and Sydney West Airport. When the issue is aircraft noise, it becomes even less likely that there would be agreement. The government has already outlined the approach it will be taking.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real effect of this amendment proposed by Senator Margetts would be to delay the lease of airports, probably forever. It would frustrate completely the government's plans for leasing the airport by making the lease of every airport conditional on an agreement about aircraft noise being signed by Sydney councils. It is therefore not a high hurdle; it is an impossible dream.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(12.16 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The amendment is not only about noise; it is about air traffic as well. I am well aware that there are a number of airports around Australia which are not frequently part of this debate but which have a problem with air traffic. You have only to drive south down the Mitchell freeway in Perth to find there are a great many small aircraft using Jandakot airport. That is a traffic problem as much as or more than a noise problem. The idea of such a model is to look at ways to have councils somehow involved with the plan. I think councils are sensible enough to know there are good plans and not so good plans. At least that ought to be taken into consideration when those plans are developed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They were promised all sorts of things which governments said they could achieve in relation to the third runway. Many people felt that what did come about did not relate much to what they were promised in the first place. What people and councils are hoping for is a written agreement so there is something they can come back to when people make promises about the future. It does not mean aircraft going every which way; it means there is some participation in the process and that governments have to make an effort to listen to that concern and talk about what the issues and choices are. If, in the end, this means <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2911"> utilising more than one airport, then maybe that is the best way to go about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps this is a lesson that we should be learning, that instead of involving councils and the community at a late stage in the process it is best to involve them at an early stage so they are part of it and have realised what the implications and choices are or are not, and the decisions they can make. I am sure there are ways of devising this process so that councils can see that there are optimum outcomes and that that is what they will be working for. I am sure it is possible to devise a system where councils can agree to an optimum outcome.</PARA></SPEECH>

It is my understanding that the majority of Sydney councils and Sydney constituents are not arguing about the privatisation or otherwise of Sydney airport; they are arguing about the noise problem. I thought I should add that basically there was an assumption there that the bill would have been scuttled if the amendment had gone through. I do not think that that was necessarily the case. There was an incentive for agreement to be reached, and I think the majority of councils around Sydney airport actually felt that the desire was to work to the best possible arrangement.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the time the Airports Bill 1996 was debated in the House of Representatives, the opposition moved amendments which would have reinstated the cross-ownership provisions included by the previous government in the Airports Bill 1995 and limited the scope of the ministerial exemption from consultation provisions on draft master plans and environment strategies. The minister indicated these proposals would be given further consideration before debate in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister subsequently wrote to the Senate committee considering the airport bills to advise the government's preparedness to reinstate the cross-ownership provisions, the government's preference to remove the two exemption clauses&mdash;sections 71 and 117&mdash;and the government's intention to make a technical amendment to clause 14 of the schedule to the bill to ensure the provisions related to foreign persons, not foreign companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate committee reported at the start of these sittings and recommended that the bills be passed, subject to these three amendments notified to the committee by the minister. I indicate that the government's amendments are consistent with the changes advised to the Senate committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will now address the issue of cross-ownership restrictions. The amendments moved by the government will reinstate the cross-ownership provisions of the Airports Bill 1995 and so will achieve the identical position taken by the previous Labor government on the matter. This change is expected to meet the concerns which have been expressed to the government about the need for separation of the ownership of Sydney airport from Melbourne airport and Sydney airport from Brisbane airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments will include in the bill a requirement that the airport lessee and management companies for Sydney airport and Sydney West airport be controlled separately from the lessee or management companies of either Melbourne airport or Brisbane airport. For this purpose, the bill as amended will deem a holding of more than 15 per cent of any of the paid up capital, voting power and rights to distribution of profit and capital to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2918"> constitute control. The bill will also provide that the minister may determine that a person has practical control when a person with an interest of less than 15 per cent or no interest effectively has control of a company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to consultations on draft airport plans, during debate in the House of Representatives the opposition proposed amendments to limit the power of the minister under clauses 71 and 117 to exempt certain draft master plans and environment strategies from the public comment processes established by the bill. The intention of the provisions in the bill was to enable the minister to exempt draft plans in circumstances in which it would have been unreasonable to require public comment and consultation, such as when proposed changes to a plan had resulted from public comment. The government considers that removing the clauses would be simpler than adopting the amendments which the opposition proposed during debate in the House of Representatives, as they are likely to be unworkable. This matter, as I mentioned earlier, was certainly flagged to the Senate committee and considered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to technical amendments to clause 14 of the schedule, clause 14 applies the 49 per cent limit on foreign ownership to holding companies for airport companies. The clause is intended to provide that the 49 per cent limit on foreign ownership will be applied on the basis of ownership of the holding company. Therefore, for example, a foreign person could own up to 49 per cent of a holding company, with the holding company in turn wholly owning one or more airport operator companies. Without a special provision, such as clause 14, this would not be possible, as the holding company would be characterised as a foreign person and so could hold most of the 49 per cent of an airport company. Commercially, this outcome would be unrealistic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To ensure that clause 14 serves its purpose, references in it to `a foreign company' need to be replaced by references to `a foreign person', because the foreign ownership limitations in the bill relate to a foreign person rather than a foreign company. The government's amendments address the substantial <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> concern that was raised in debate and in the Senate committee dealing with the airport bills, and I commend these amendments to the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make some brief comments in relation to the government amendments and also to refer to some foreshadowed amendments by the Greens to this legislation. I will not delay the committee stage too much.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Western Australia, particularly at Perth airport, a number of concerns have been raised by people who have a link with and a fascination and a support for the bushland around that airport. I took the opportunity a few weeks ago, with Senator Margetts, some friends of the Perth airport bushland, some conservation groups and also the member for Swan, Don Randall, to do a detailed inspection of those bushland areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many members of the conservation movement in Western Australia who are supporting the Perth bushland have indicated that they are opposed to privatisation, and of course that is their right. They are opposed to it, as they told me and have communicated to me in a number of letters, because they are concerned about conservation outcomes as a consequence of the privatisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From my own experience in investigating those sites, it would be fair to say that there are some unique qualities and some beautiful patches of typical Western Australian sandy based bushland which have been recognised by the Australian Heritage Commission in their listing on the national register. The problem is that areas like Mundey's Swamp&mdash;one of the unique areas that has been listed&mdash;have become overrun with weeds. It has had virtually no money spent on the management of it. Some of the other areas have been spoiled by fires from, we presume, kids getting in there and burning cars or having camps on Saturday nights and by lots of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2919"> litter&mdash;rubbish, broken bottles, used car bodies&mdash;scattered throughout them. It is an area that has some unique, natural qualities and because it is required to be a buffer zone for airport noise and other safety elements around the airport it will, in large part, stay as natural bushland for generations to come and should be considered worthy of rehabilitation and long&hyphen;term conservation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a conflict with plans for the future expansion of Perth airport, particularly the development of a further runway when the traffic at Perth airport requires that to be built. The Federal Airports Corporation informed me that that may not be for some 20 or 25 years, based on traffic projections. Nonetheless, as all of us know, the construction of new airports is not only a very expensive business but also a very important business to get right environmentally, as we have seen with the controversy surrounding the Sydney West proposals. It is very important in this bushland around the Perth airport to achieve a sensible balance with the needs of conservation and to ensure that we have our biodiversity and remnant urban bushland protected for a whole range of values, one of the most important being to ensure that the very good people of Perth have the opportunity to see what their countryside looked like before it was developed for urban use. There needs to be a balance for the future needs of Perth airport as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be environmentally stupid to say that these areas could not be developed in the future, because we would then be required to find another patch of land somewhere near the Perth metropolitan area to develop another&mdash;probably $1 billion&mdash;airport facility. My own view, which I think is supported by evidence in many parts of the world, is that the privatisation process creates a unique opportunity to see private sector funds being channelled into important rehabilitation of those areas and into long&hyphen;term conservation. I think that sensible environmentalists, as I am sure most of them are, should see this as an opportunity and not as a loss for the environment. The successful bidder for Perth airport will be encouraged to submit plans for a whole range of operations at the airport and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> I think the environmental plans that those tenderers put forward should form an important part of that process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite crucial, if we are seriously concerned about conserving the areas around Perth airport, that money is spent on rehabilitation. The weeds need to be controlled. Access by feral animals and access by the public need to be controlled so that particularly the flora and the fauna, the biodiversity qualities and the unique natural heritage qualities of the Perth airport bushland can be preserved and conserved for the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by saying that I will be working in conjunction with the member for Swan, Don Randall, and the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, Mr Sharp, with whom we have already had a meeting to discuss this and who is very keen to ensure that the privatisation process is good for the environment, particularly the environment around the Perth airport. I encourage those people who care about the Perth airport bushland to be involved in this process. I encourage them to interact with the people who place bids for the Perth airport. I will certainly try to facilitate that as the process goes along. I certainly hope and expect that the outcomes for the environment around the Perth airport will be good ones. It should be a win&hyphen;win situation for the budget, it will be a win&hyphen;win for the travelling public and it will be a win for the bushland around the airport.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition does not oppose this bill. However, we do feel it necessary to make a few points. The principal act of this measure, the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Act, was first dealt with by the parliament in 1991. Essentially, that occurred in the context of the emergence of quite a substantial overseas student services sector of the education industry in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Educational services to overseas students were threatened quite significantly by the emergence of some quite extraordinarily unscrupulous providers in the private education sector, some considerable difficulties in regard to the unevenness of quality of both the services provided and the support structures that were available for students, breaches by students of visa conditions, and the financial collapse of several private institutions with the consequent adverse publicity that occurred in overseas countries as a result of students losing considerable sums of money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The principal act was aimed at trying to restore Australia's reputation for sound educational practice. In particular that act was aimed at overseas countries; it was to ensure that people coming to this country for educational purposes would be treated with some equity and some fairness. Of course, there was an understanding that Australia's reputation had to be protected in so far as the national government had a responsibility to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2921"> maintain high quality education and training within this country while, at the same time, balancing out that responsibility with those of the states&mdash;which, sadly I note, have yet to respond adequately, as a consequence of which this measure is required. Also, the principal act was aimed at ensuring taxpayers funds were not required to compensate any international students who had been let down by unscrupulous providers, and that unscrupulous individuals were not being subsidised by public moneys.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as concerns of the review process that was undertaken, the original report came out in 1992. However, in 1993, upon my becoming a member of the education committee, these issues were revisited. The report was, in fact, quite a good one and has added substantially to our understanding of these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs has relied quite heavily on the reports of the consultants Ernst and Young which sought to make a contribution to this debate by seeking an extension of the act for a further two years because of the states' failure to respond adequately; by recommending the simplification of existing legislation to ensure that better and more appropriate responsibilities of the Commonwealth be defined; that simpler provider accounts and auditing requirements be instituted; that expanded scope for exemption of detailed financial regulatory requirements be ensured; that there be adequate consultation between the Commonwealth and the states and industry bodies with a view to making sure that this matter was properly reviewed by 1 January 1998; and by ensuring that there be a sunset clause within the current arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that the government's reliance upon regulation in this regard is the means by which the simplification will occur. As I understand, Minister, that is the mechanism which you are seeking to use; that is a regulatory framework. I am not altogether certain how widely understood that regulatory framework is. I would appreciate any comment the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Vanstone) would make in that regard. In terms of the changes, it is likely that there will be an extension of the financial matters in regard to the operation of the tuition assurance schemes, where groups of providers jointly guarantee, on behalf of each of their number, that the provision of tuition is paid for overall.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, this is the real problem: that, in the current general climate of deregulation, as I understand it, there has been very little support amongst stakeholders in favour of industry self-regulation. The principal concerns centre on Australia's international reputation in the provision of education services and whether the industry currently has sufficient maturity to ensure self-regulation. These were the issues that the Senate committee examined and reported upon. I am just wondering, Minister, whether or not there has been any change to those circumstances. I look forward to your response in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I understand it, stakeholder agreements between the Commonwealth and the providers would continue to have a regulatory function but that regulation entirely by the states or territory governments is not desirable nor is it feasible, given their record in this area. I draw your attention, Minister, to the consultant's report which stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there was a need for some continuing Government role in regulation of matters relevant to international students for the foreseeable future and that there was no case for substantial changes to existing policy.</PARA>
<PARA>While the opposition does support these measures, I raise those concerns with the minister and I would ask her for a response.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do indicate some concern in so far as the provisions have been made for some time for this industry, and it is stated that there has been a growing maturity. But, as I understand it, a few years ago it was found that, in a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> particular year, some 22 agencies had failed to meet the audit requirements and had been suspended. I am not altogether certain how many of those ultimately were withdrawn. Given that this is an industry that now involves some $1.9 billion in overseas exports, it is important that we do get it clear as to what is the level of maturity in this industry and the extent to which your officials have adequately supervised this arrangement.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Health and Other Services (Compensation) Amendment Bill 1996 is supported by the opposition. The original bill was introduced during the period of the last government. Essentially, it was brought in to ensure that third party personal claims were not paid out, that moneys owing to the Commonwealth for Medicare, and possibly nursing home costs, were repaid before the plaintiffs received their funds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although essentially worth while and effective in having Commonwealth funds repaid, unfortunately the legislation had the unhappy consequence for many plaintiffs that, because of the time delay required for the assessment of funds owing to the Commonwealth, in fact they had to wait for very long periods. I am advised by members of the legal fraternity, in particular, that there is a huge backlog as we speak. Essentially, this bill resolves the matter by allowing 90 per cent of the funds to be paid out to the plaintiff and for 10 per cent to be retained until the assessment of moneys owing to the Commonwealth is made. Evidence suggests that, in the vast majority of cases, this will cover the money owed to the Commonwealth, which appears to be, on average, in the range of seven per cent.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose there are circumstances, though you would think unusual, where the money owed to the Commonwealth will be in excess of that 10 per cent. In those circumstances, I have been assured that the plaintiff will be contacted and some convivial arrangement will be made for the repayment of those funds. I am told that there will not be any unfair pressure put on plaintiffs; that nothing will be repossessed that might make their lives difficult or generally cause problems; and that arrangements will be made, in an orderly fashion, for the repayment of anything beyond that 10 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Essentially, the opposition supports the legislation. There is, I understand, some retrospectivity in this bill. Generally, in a situation where the effect of legislation adversely affected members of the general community, you would have to be very concerned but, in this case, the retrospectivity acts to the benefit of those members of the public who are affected. That being the case, I am very happy to support it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA>These amendments are designed to immediately clear the backlog of cases. Senator Neal has referred to the retrospectivity involved and this is one of the issues in which there is an element of retrospectivity. There is hardship going on, and it is being experienced by a number of people who are compensable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the bill was introduced, much work has been undertaken in ensuring a more efficient and equitable system, and the further amendments improve the bill even more. These improvements are achieved by making the advanced payment process available to all cases, right back to the commencement of the original act on 1 February this year, rather than from the date of the passage of this bill. Since this backlog is quite significant, this will mean a significant benefit to a large number of people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to give some assurances about recovery of debts by the Commonwealth, where the amount owing to the Commonwealth is greater than 10 per cent of the advanced payment and where the compensation payer makes an advance payment to the HIC. The settlement of any additional moneys owed to the Commonwealth is negotiated between the HIC and the person. There are a number of steps in that process which I think will allow a sensitive approach to that recovery. If there is disagreement after that process, there is a right of appeal to the AAT, and it is binding on both parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question of 10 per cent might be an issue. Let me address that briefly. There may be a substantial number of cases where the amount owing to the Commonwealth is more <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2925"> than the 10 per cent advance payment&mdash;that is, that the figure which has been chosen is not the correct figure. By way of a disallowable instrument, the minister can determine a higher percentage. That would ensure that, in most cases, the amount held by the Commonwealth would cover the debt and not place an additional burden on the person. Of course, if it goes the other way and the average amount owing to the Commonwealth is less than 10 per cent, the regulations allow the minister to decrease the advance payment percentage to be held. I think that is a very fair and appropriate method which allows flexibility and a commonsense approach.</PARA>

In addition, there are requirements under the Medicare agreement about issues such as cost shifting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Health and Family Services, Dr  Wooldridge, has made it very clear that of recent years there has been massive cost shifting in the public hospitals of the states onto the Commonwealth.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although the cost shifting has, in fact, increased by a substantial amount, the amount that is being clawed back by the Commonwealth, I understand, is simply a small proportion of the amount which the states are benefiting from by the cost shifting, which is not really endorsed under the Medicare agreement.</PARA></ANSWER>

Quite frankly, I would not; because if you look at those press releases you see that the first two were obviously attempts to try to muscle in on the industrial relations portfolio.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My congratulations also, Madam President, on your election to high office. My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security. Senator New <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2932"> man, your government is proposing to spend $3.5 billion on the family tax initiative. At the same time, you expect to save $2.6 billion from a range of initiatives to tighten up on social security and welfare. These include, according to the Treasurer, strengthening the activity test for jobsearch and newstart allowances and improving fraud detection and debt recovery. Can you detail to the Senate and to the millions of Australians whose wellbeing depends on government assistance the assumptions on which those $2.6 billion in savings are based?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is pretty clear that most Australians are concerned about the social security system and I have found, in the six months I have had this portfolio, that that has been one of the strong messages that have come from the wider community. It is a matter of some concern to me, because if people genuinely in need of income support are not to be demonised in our country then their receipt of benefits has to be regarded as being produced by a clean and efficient system where only those eligible for benefits actually get them. Having said that, there has been considerable evidence over some time that the more resources that go into protecting the system from fraud and abuse the more the system produces savings. So it is cost&hyphen;effective to put more work into trying to locate those who would cheat the system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The debate often gets bogged down in how many of this and how many of that. The fact remains that there are people who were abusing the system under the previous government, and they made some attempts to do something about it. But the senator is new enough not to know, for example, that it took Senator Patterson in opposition to discover that prisoners in gaols were being paid social security benefits when they were not entitled to them. In other words, we must have good and accurate information on which to base eligibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would suggest that, even if some people in politics seem to like the idea of dead men voting, not many Australians like the idea of dead men getting pensions.

Can you inform the Senate when and where Mr Howard promised to cut $83.5 million from the lump sum advance scheme for pensioners and allowees?

I notice that the opposition spokesman made no mention of the fact that the government had made a commitment to maintain the pension at 25 per cent of total male average weekly earnings. Not only has the government honoured that commitment; it has done what the previous government did not do in all its 13 years, that is, make provision in the forward estimates for that pension rate to be maintained.</PARA></TALK.START>

In addition we promised, twice a year, to index the pension. And that is being kept. In addition, we promised low income retirees that they would have an effective tax rate comparable to that of pensioners. That we have kept. Despite what we heard from Senator Neal last night, we have increased by 6.7 per cent the funding for the HACC scheme, which is of course of very great importance to older Australians.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a very important point you make, Senator West, because there were no answers given to the questions put to Senator Newman today. What we are now very aware of is that the mumbo jumbo that Senator Newman did give by way of answer indicates clearly to this side of the chamber that she does not know what she is talking about. She does not know her own portfolio area. She does not know how to answer in relation to social security. She certainly cannot tell us the facts about health.

She could not find the right briefing note and took until today to even get around to talking about that. Her answers today were of exactly the same order&mdash;no substance, obfuscation, personal abuse and anything to avoid substantive answers to the questions. That is because she is part of a government that wants to tell the people of Australia that the government has given them something good in this budget. They do not like to deal with what was so succinctly exposed, not only by Mr Beazley and Mr Evans and other people in this place but also by Senator Kernot today: you might have given people $5 billion, but you have taken away $12.5 billion. All those promises are broken promises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why on earth did you not tell elderly Australians that if they needed assistance with their dental care they would not be getting it? Where, in the run up to the election, did you <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2940"> say that to people? You said, `We will not do anything to make life harder for older Australians.' But you have, Senator. It is going to be a matter of great regret as the people in the community understand what you have done by way of deceit, by way of broken promises, by way of damage to Australian families, and by way of damage to older Australians.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS>, 52 per cent of people said that, if they had the chance again, they would not be voting this way.

She will duck and twist and weave rather than face the truth of the deceptions and lies the opposition told in the run&hyphen;up to the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about elderly Australians being assisted by having to find at least $26,000 to go into a nursing home? What about Mr Howard saying today, by way of helping families, `If they can't find money, I expect their children to help them'? Families live in great fear that some of their older relatives might need to retire to a nursing home or hostel. They are finding it bad enough to deal with that without this great gift you have given them of having to pay $26,000 to even get in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what you have done to those people. That is one of the problems. You have removed their access to dental services. You have increased the cost of prescriptions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today firstly to put on the public record that Senator Newman is here. Senator <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2941"> Crowley said she had gone. That is appalling. Also, it is amazing that Senator Crowley would say that Senator Newman spoke mumbo jumbo. The answers that Senator Crowley gave when she was a minister were verbal fruit salad!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to put paid to the untruths that are being bandied around, scaring older people about going into nursing homes. I find what Senator Neal said in the adjournment debate last night offensive and I find what Senator Crowley said today offensive. Let me put on the public record that the changes to nursing homes will, in fact, be along the lines of contributions that are made to hostels now, contributions which were brought in in 1988 by the then Labor government. The changes that we have brought in to nursing homes will not impact on full pensioners, who make up 65 per cent of residents of nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those opposite to stand there and say that people will pay $26,000 to go into a nursing homes is wrong, wrong, wrong, and they should know it is. Senator Crowley is just trying to scare older people. People going into nursing homes who can afford to make a contribution will do so on the same basis as people who go into hostels and can afford to make a contribution. For all full pensioners entering nursing homes this will continue to be the case. Entry fees will not be set by government. People entering a nursing home will negotiate an entry contribution with the provider. The government will ensure safeguards. Entry contributions will not be charged to full pensioners or existing residents. Anyone who has assets of less than $22,280 will not be charged an entry contribution. Entry contributions will not apply for short stays of up to six months, and that applies to many people who go into nursing homes. I can give you an example of my stepfather, who died in April. He was not in the nursing home six months, so he would not have been required to make an entry contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The provider can only take out of that contribution $2,600 per annum over five years. The balance of that is then left to go back to the resident or back into their estate. So even to say that they are paying a $26,000 <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> entry contribution is, in fact, a furphy. There will be no draw&hyphen;down for the first six months and the maximum that can be drawn down over five years is set at $13,000. This means that where the entry contribution is $20,000 or $50,000 the maximum draw&hyphen;down is $13,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How can you have sat over there for years and protected people who had huge incomes and not required them to pay an entry contribution to a nursing home? Millionaires were able to go into a nursing home and have no other additional cost other than the pension. That is what you did, and you let nursing homes degenerate. Professor Gregory said $300 million would be needed to bring nursing homes up to an acceptable level. That is what you let happen, while millionaires went into nursing homes paying no entry contribution. Now what you are saying is, `Don't let them pay. We can't let millionaires pay to go into nursing homes.' How ridiculous! All members of the industry have been saying there ought to be a contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People who are on low incomes will be protected. If the Labor Party goes out telling older people that they have to pay $26,000, it will cause grief and distress amongst thousands of older people who should not be facing that grief and distress from being told fibs, lies and untruths by the Labor Party. I find it offensive, totally un&hyphen;Australian and appalling that they would do that to older Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me just say how the contributions work, just to make it clear. The contributions will be based on a person's ability to pay. Let me say it again, just so the Labor Party can understand. It will be based on a person's ability to pay. It will not be that everyone pays $26,000. Pensioners will not be required to pay. People's assets will be assessed. Even now a lot of providers do not ask for an entry contribution, even though they are allowed to do it. A very small percentage of them&mdash;I think it is about six per cent&mdash;ask for the maximum contribution. It has worked well. There are checks and balances to ensure that people are not deprived. They make a contribution according to their ability to pay and it allows hostels to have capital upgrading.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2942">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has happened under Labor is that nursing homes have degenerated. In some nursing homes there are six people in a ward.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I took note of Senator Newman's earlier comment that this budget was a caring budget. All I can say in response is that, if this is a caring budget, she certainly knows how to kill with love. A few comments have been made by some people in the community who really do care&mdash;and they are not overwhelmingly supportive. I would like to read an extract of an article that appeared today relating to comments made by ACOSS. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Welfare groups yesterday accused the government of betraying unemployed youth and of unfairly hurting low income earners with spending cuts in the budget. The Australian Council of Social Service said that low income earners were the target of 30 per cent of the principal cuts. The ACOSS paper tallied cuts in labour market programs, social security, health and family services, Aboriginal affairs, education, and the justice system. It found that of the $11 billion in significant cuts over the next two years $3.4 billion would mainly hit low income earners</PARA>
<PARA>What did Mr Howard say in response to this? He dismissed the criticism, saying that he had `kept the core promises'. Obviously, there are a number of things that he does not consider to be core promises&mdash;and certainly Senator Newman does not either. She obviously thinks commitments to the elderly people and the less well&hyphen;off elderly people in our community are not core promises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Let us look at what this budget has done to elderly people in the community. Look at the concessional pharmaceutical benefits. There have been cuts to those for pensioners and health card holders&mdash;an extra 50c each time. As we know, pensioners use a lot of prescriptions. They are probably the biggest users of prescriptions in the community. Is that 50c each pop, each prescription being compen sated for? No. It is being taken out of pensioners' pockets and they are not getting anything back.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where else have pensioners lost out? The Commonwealth dental scheme has been abolished&mdash;a scheme that was set up to deal with the waiting list of pensioners and health card holders. Before this scheme was introduced, the states had a scheme that had a 24-month waiting list. Do you know what that meant? It meant that pensioners who had problems with their teeth had those teeth extracted; there was no time to give them treatment. That is what we are going back to. Pensioners will have to either go in there and have quick treatment, a quick extraction, or, alternatively, pay for themselves. Has this loss to be suffered by elderly people been compensated for? No.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at HACC services. The minister, after a day, was able to work out what had happened to HACC services&mdash;or at least some part of it. She came in and told us that there would be more money in there. That is fabulous. But the only problem is that every individual will have to pay for those services. In the line items in the budget, it says `increase user charging in the home and community care program'. So what you are saying is that everyone who uses HACC services&mdash;the frail and the aged, the young and the disabled&mdash;will have to pay more in user charges. But that is not where the pain stops.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you! Unfortunately, that is not where the pain stops for the elderly; that is not where the broken promises <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2943"> for the elderly stop in this budget. Nursing home entry fees! The more they squeal, the more you know it is true. You have introduced or allowed to be introduced nursing home entry fees. Yes, we do not know the exact amount of these fees because the minister will not tell us. None of the people in private industry know because the minister cannot tell them. But, on average, present entry fees for hostels are $26,000. So it is reasonable to assume that it will be much the same in relation to nursing homes. But, again, that is not the worst of it. The maximum they can charge you is $88,000. Minister, you may feel that it is caring to charge elderly people $88,000 to get into a nursing home&mdash;but, personally, I do not think it is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where else have you broken your promises? You have also taken away the funds for the loans provision for capital works for nursing homes. The elderly do not need that assistance; we will take that money away and put it somewhere else.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not asked. Senator Neal has in fact repeated those inaccuracies again now. I want to deal with the facts as Senator Neal would have us believe <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> them. First of all, she went into some detail last night about the so-called savings in HACC. She has not had the decency to acknowledge that she was utterly wrong. That is why I mentioned today that there was a 6.7 per cent increase in HACC funding. Why doesn't she own up to that?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once again just now she has said something about loan moneys&mdash;remember the word you used, Senator Neal. She said that the provision for loan moneys for capital works in nursing homes has been abolished. First of all, they are not loans; they are grants. Secondly, they have not been abolished&mdash;get your facts right. However, Senator Neal, if you are really interested in this question they have been reduced in the budget papers because there is an expectation that a number of proprietors will prefer to take alternative forms of funding from the Commonwealth grants for which they currently have a commitment. It is up to the owners of the nursing homes as to whether they continue with the grants for which they have a contract or whether they move to another arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, there was some talk about how much people are going to pay in by way of means testing. Perhaps Senator Neal has not worked out yet that there is going to be 25c in the dollar over the free area capped at a total of $60 a week&mdash;so much for your accuracies there! It is currently $26.05. These measures are tough, sure, but they are fair. I understand they have been looked at in every Labor budget so far but the previous government has not had the intestinal fortitude to do something about it, when we know that nursing homes have been so run down over the last few years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said in question time, Professor Gregory has made recommendations about the amount of money that needs to go into upgrading the facilities at nursing homes. I am afraid that what we are getting from the opposition now is shouting, noise and misinformation. I notice that not only was there Senator Neal's speech last night but also Dr Carmen Lawrence has been putting out a mass of information that is supposedly fact but in fact is not true.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;`Women betrayed', she said. Who betrayed women but Carmen Lawrence anyway? There are so many things to answer. With the pharmaceuticals I promised that I would give you an additional answer and I ran out of time. You might be interested to know that the studies that the government has done show that, on average, pensioners are only getting 31 scripts a year. They get enough money under the new arrangements to cover them for 42 scripts, so they are covered, and if they run out of those then they end up on the free list. I think that you have not understood or you have deliberately misrepresented&mdash;I do not know which it is&mdash;the situation that people will find themselves in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once again, I point out that in this country we would not be in this position if your government had not left the books in such a mess and been so dishonest at the election about what situation they were in. It was very difficult for us to frame a budget that would be caring, compassionate and humane. I think that this government has done a fantastic job in maintaining those very important commitments to older people that I referred to in question time. It is no thanks to the former government that older people have been so protected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The very fact that there has not been a cry from the nation, along the lines that Senator Neal and some of her colleagues have been making in this place, demonstrates how people recognise there was a need to take stiff measures for Australia to get its budget back in order again. The Labor Party does not like to hear that because it was responsible for the mess. But if Australia is going to get up off its knees again, we are trying to make sure that we do it as soon as possible and in the fairest way possible. Older  Australians are not fools. They understand that we have to get it right for the sake of their children and their grandchildren. If there is any fault in this budget at all, we know where the guilty party is.</PARA></SPEECH>

I ask: which is it; is it caring or is it tough?  Thirdly, she referred to the books being in a mess as she did earlier in this place in regard to so-called housewives. I know that Senator Newman has a very busy portfolio but I am sure she would be aware that over 100 economists signed a letter to the Treasurer, Peter Costello, pointing out that the kinds of measures you have now taken in this budget would be inappropriate for the overall state of the health of the economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we all know, economists do not usually agree, but over 100 economists did sign that letter about two months ago. I note that the government did not take any notice of it. It is distinctly untrue to say that the economy is in a mess, because we know that people do not believe this to be the case. There is a stable situation in this country. The kinds of measures that you have taken in cutting back&mdash;overwhelmingly in community services&mdash;are simply going to destabilise the economy, increase unemployment and have adverse effects on so many Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I believe that I have the answer, if I can be so presumptuous as to suggest it, as to why there is such confusion here in this place on what the government has done in relation to the measures we have been discussing this afternoon. The answer lies here in your statement entitled More Choice for Women. You did table a statement&mdash;I am sure that is welcome in many quarters&mdash;but you did not maintain a 12-year precedent of presenting a women's budget statement that would have detailed to a considerable extent the measures of this budget and how they would impact on women and families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know whether you tried to develop a women's budget impact statement. It has become a tradition in Australia that has been admired internationally, that has been praised in the United Nations and that has been advocated by the Commonwealth Secretariat for all Commonwealth countries. Yet, on the first opportunity that you had as Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2945"> Women, you abandoned this process of adopting a women's budget impact statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I know, having been where you now sit, that it is not always easy to win in cabinet and I sympathise with you in that regard. But I do say to you that I challenge the government to rethink its position. It is a very serious matter that there is now no document anywhere among the budget papers that actually demonstrates to us what the impact of your various budget measures is on 54 per cent of the population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not too late to actually go back to your department about this. I know that the Office of the Status of Women has been subject to dramatic funding cuts. It is not too late to go back to the Office of the Status of Women and the various government departments that are responsible for many of the measures in this budget and ask them to do that analysis and then come back to this place and table a proper assessment of the impact of this budget on women. I would challenge the minister and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to allow this to happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the document More Choice for Women contains measures that will be welcome in some sectors of the community it is not comprehensive. For example, there is no mention of women with disabilities. There is no mention of indigenous women or migrant women.

You have the audacity to come in here today and talk about fairness. There were none of these measures in your policies for 13 years. What we have with this policy in this document in this budget is some fairness and equity being brought back in. Let me quote one of your colleagues, former Senator Richardson who said in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> :</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">One idea I had which had no chance of ever being accepted by my caucus or cabinet colleagues was to charge an increased Medicare levy for high&hyphen;income earners who refused to take out private insurance. I was never comfortable with the thought of wealthy people elbowing battlers out of queues in public hospitals. "A crisis in public hospitals would occur within 10 years" was what they used to say three years ago. With public hospitals now unable to provide beds for emergency cases and some people dying because of it, with casualty and emergency wards overflowing and rejecting in some cases as many as 70% of those who come seeking assistance, with bed numbers being cut across the country, there is just a suggestion that the crisis might be looming a little earlier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Everyone has to lose some battles but I wish I had won this one. Now the Liberal Party is putting forward the same idea.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There can be no doubt about where the great majority will stand on this. The vast numbers of Australians earning less than $50,000 a year will reckon that those earning more and able to afford more ought to be paying more. They will be even more convinced of the worth of this proposal if the Coalition adopts the rest of my proposal as well.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a quote from one of your colleagues and a former Minister for Health. He sought to do what we have actually done. He sought to make the people at the bottom end of the scale, the low and middle income earners, more comfortable and able to gain greater access to health services.

<TIME.STAMP>(3.39 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This proposition goes to the question of this government's integrity when it comes to the issues of higher education and other educational programs. As I understand the talk around this town, the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, explained to a number of people before the budget was brought down that, after the budget was brought down, she would be the most unpopular minister for education in the Commonwealth's history. I think that is one promise she has kept. There have been very few others that she has kept.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we see in these budget papers is an attempt to disguise and deceive, just like the election strategy of the Liberal Party from its very commencement. You promise anything, you say anything and you do anything you think is necessary to get you a few votes and then in practice you do very little of what you promised and what you committed to. We have seen again and again this strategy being followed. These budget papers follow that practice by suggesting that there are increases in education expenditure when, in fact, the opposite is the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, as I gave your papers a bit more careful reading rather than just the superficial reading your press relations people would encourage us to do, I found that, over the next four years, the total cuts to budget programs administered by your department will amount to something in the order of $5.8 billion. That is $5.8 billion worth of cuts being administered by this minister in the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. That would have to be one of the greatest levels of cuts that any Commonwealth minister responsible for <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this department has had to endure in the history of this Commonwealth. Yet another great achievement!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question is: is this just a case of the minister's incompetence or is it a case of the ERC imposing on her decisions that no other minister would accept and, therefore, is it just a failure to administer her department and to defend her constituency the way she ought to as the minister responsible for such an important area of government activity?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We looked at the detail very clearly. We were promised by this government before the election that it would maintain existing programs in the schools area. If I recall the promise made by Senator Hill in February this year, he said, `We will at least maintain Commonwealth specific purpose payments to schools in line with the forward estimates recurrent, capital and targeted equity programs.' When you look at the budget papers that clearly has not occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you look at the other higher education areas, the promise was simple: `We will maintain the level of funding for operating grants to universities and there will be no cuts in university places.' According to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, `Iron&hyphen;clad commitments have been given that the overall funding for universities would be maintained.' So it goes on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same pattern is emerging out of every area of activity undertaken by this department. As I read it, it is a very simple proposition. With Austudy the lies and deceit continue. For instance, the statement issued by this government says that the coalition government is firmly committed to maintain the level of benefits to eligible families which Austudy provides. You would think that that means that it wants to spend money on Austudy and maintain the level of benefits. Nothing could be further from the truth because, when you read the budget papers carefully, you find cuts in excess of $514 million being made to Austudy. So, with such things like case management of homeless students, you see that quite significant cuts have been undertaken&mdash;quite contrary to the commitments given before the election.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2948">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We see in the case of Abstudy and Austudy that the age of independence has been raised to 25 years. We see that the tightening of the various eligibility tests will produce substantial savings from the government's point of view. We see breaches being made in English as a second language and in TAFE programs. We see cuts to operating grants, to growth funding, to the states, to TAFE colleges and to the VET sector generally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, in higher eduction the case is abundantly clear. In relation to HECS funding, in total some $2.4 billion overall has been taken away from Australians and taken out of the higher education sector as a result of this government's programs&mdash;$2.4 billion! Nothing could be clearer: in terms of discretionary funds $214 million has been taken out; in terms of raising the independent allowance for students receiving Austudy payments, some $241 million; in terms of tightening the means test, $817 million; and in terms of lowering the threshold, $312 million. We see similar sorts of figures in terms of differential HECS. Some $623 million in operating grants will also be taken away from this sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what we see is a government that has quite clearly been caught out, a government that cannot keep its word. In a whole range of areas&mdash;in the operation of universities, support to students and equity programs&mdash;quite clearly this government has not maintained its commitments and has quite clearly breached them. We see that not one extra dollar has been put into equity programs&mdash;not one extra dollar! What this government is seeking to do is repackage Labor programs, re&hyphen;announce them, reclaim them as its own and say, `Oh, yes. We're keeping our commitments.' That is not what it said before the election. In terms of up-front fees, quite a significant impact will be had upon the disincentive rates&mdash;that is, people being forced out of universities&mdash;as a result of the actions being taken by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Aboriginal education is one of the clearest areas I can point to where fundamental breaches have occurred. These are not big sums of money at all but, in terms of the principles at stake here, in terms of the equity <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> arrangements entered into by this government and in terms of the importance of education in trying to provide a better, fairer and more productive society, this government has failed dismally. Quite clearly, it does not understand the value of higher education and it does not understand the importance of making sure all Australians do participate within it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were told that Aboriginal education would be exempt from the moves on ATSIC, that that program would be left apart from any changes. But what do we find today? We find&mdash;although we do not see this too clearly in any of the budget papers; that is part of the game, isn't it, making sure that as little information as possible explaining what is happening in the forward estimates is available&mdash;on page 8 of the budget statements, which deals with direct assistance in Aboriginal education, that there have been quite specific cuts to programs in the coming year. Of course, over the next four years these cuts will become even more pronounced. I notice there has also been a significant cut in tuition assistance. The vocational guidance program has been cut. The Aboriginal parents program has been cut. In terms of the Aboriginal education strategic initiative program, $1.5 million will be taken out next year, and this cut will grow to $31 million by the turn of the century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are seeing will have quite detrimental effects on Aboriginal tertiary education assistance. This is quite contrary to the claims made that education would be exempt from cuts relating to ATSIC. This is another set of lies, more deceit, more deception. We all understand what that means in terms of equity, because we understand that education provides a vehicle for many people to change their life circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, this is yet one more opportunity for the rich and powerful to maintain their influence in this society. The minister goes on and on about how hard life was under Labor, but her complaint was that we spent too much, that Labor did too much. She said the way to fix that up is to make the poor pay more. She has offered a few scholarships&mdash;a miserable 1,000 scholarships, I think. There <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2949"> are 650,000 students in this country at the moment. What a miserable effort!</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Carr, with the greatest of respect, you did yourself no service whatsoever in that presentation. You displayed either a capacity to be deceptive with the truth or an incapacity to understand it&mdash;one or the other. I do not come to either conclusion, but I just invite you to check your facts next time you come in here to engage in a bit of blunder and bluster to clear your lungs of whatever hot air is there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You raised the point, Senator Carr, that you think it is all a pack of lies&mdash;the usual claim from the Labor Party. I just invite you to consider what your own national secretary said contributed to your losing the last election. In the cold light of day, after Gary Gray had had plenty of time to consider it, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We could not run on policies because they&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the voters&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">thought we were liars on policy. We could not run on our record because they thought our record stunk.</PARA>
<PARA>So it is abundantly clear that the national secretary of the Labor Party understands that the people now in opposition are the people who are there in part&mdash;not solely but in part&mdash;because the community no longer believed them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We in this chamber have some differences of opinion as to what way we should take higher education in the future, and I want to concentrate on that aspect in particular. Senator Carr mentions $2.4 billion and happily says to voters who may be listening to the broadcast or who might read his contribution in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> that $2.4 billion has been taken out. That is either a misunderstanding or a deception because it is simply not the case. When you put together a savings package&mdash;he may not know this but other members here would&mdash;part of that savings package comes from bringing revenue ahead and some of it <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> comes from, yes, making cuts&mdash;cuts against forward estimates; that is, what people were planning on spending in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important people realise that the higher education sector, through operating grants and research, will actually get more next year than it got this year. In future years it will end up with less than it was expecting to get, yes. There are reductions. I make no bones about that. They are very small, though&mdash;one per cent next year against a forward growth estimate, three per cent the year after, one the year after that and one the year after that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are not significant savings to ask from a sector which cannot be immune from the savings task. People in higher education, whether they are going through it or teaching in it, are amongst some of the luckiest people in Australia. To ask a contribution of 1&hyphen;3&hyphen;1&hyphen;1 against their operating grant plans for the future is not a lot to ask.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bulk of the savings in the higher education sector comes from two things. Firstly, graduates are asked to pay back more quickly than they otherwise would have&mdash;that is, to reduce the point at which they start to pay back their HECS contribution. Isn't this a lucky country, Mr Deputy President, where anyone can access higher education, as they ought to be able to, on their merit. They are asked to make a contribution and they do not have to pay that contribution until they start earning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We support that system: a system introduced by the Labor Party; a system that acknowledges that, yes, there is a very public benefit in higher education, but also a private benefit; and a system that says to graduates who benefit from that, `You're going to have to pay something back. You're going to have to make a contribution.' We support that system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had this enormous savings task to fill the Beazley bankcard. We have kept the promise to keep charges to existing students the same; their charges and their debt levels do not go up. I freely admit that we say to them, `I'm sorry; you're going to have to start paying back a bit earlier&mdash;when you're earning $20,700.' I hear people saying, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2950"> `That's too low an amount. Students couldn't possibly make a contribution then.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People need to understand that people who get the benefit of higher education&mdash;as Neville Wran understood when he did the Wran report&mdash;are the luckiest people in Australia. They have an unemployment rate of 3.9 per cent; it is less than half the unemployment rate endured by other Australians who have not had that opportunity of higher education. Their starting salaries are higher than average salaries and their periods of unemployment are far less. We do not think it is unreasonable to ask for a contribution back and to ask now for a higher contribution back; other people may disagree.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we need to understand who pays for higher education. There is no such thing as free higher education; there never was. We need to understand who is paying for it. In other words: when you put a contribution in through HECS, to whom are you giving it back? You are giving it back to low and middle income earners who by and large are paying for the privilege of higher education for people who still come from higher income levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to understand that the households with the top 20 per cent of incomes enjoy 38 per cent of the benefits of higher education. The bottom 20 per cent of households enjoy only seven per cent of the benefits of higher education. So it is pretty clear who is getting the benefit. It is not unreasonable to say to graduates, `You're the ones who are getting a very substantial benefit out of this and we are going to ask you to make a bigger contribution.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is equally very fair to put some more equity into the HECS system. I accept it puts equity there for starters: everyone can get in on merit; no-one has to pay back until they have started earning an income. But they all pay the same. Teachers who have a low course cost and a lower income in later life than doctors who have a high course cost and a higher income are asked to make the same contribution as doctors. Members opposite might think that is fair; we do not think it is fair. We think a differentiated HECS contribution that acknowledges the benefits you are <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> going to get out of it and which has some interplay between the cost of your course and your expected later income is fair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, that is what Neville Wran thought when he did the report of the Committee on Higher Education Funding. He actually recommended to the previous government that they shift to a differentiated HECS; that they acknowledge that some people for the rest of their lives get more out of higher education than others. He, just like us, did not put forward a differentiated HECS solely on the cost of the course. That would have ignored the fact that nursing and science are expensive courses to run but that those people in those courses do not end up with the same private benefit, they do not end up with the high incomes that doctors and lawyers do. For that reason, we have put nursing on the lowest level that Mr Wran recommended and science in the middle. We think that is a very reasonable thing to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think for one minute that we have let down the higher education sector. In addition to restoring equity to the HECS system in that sense, we have also allowed universities much more flexibility. We will allow Australian students to buy a place, just like an international student can. The students who do that will be made up of a number of people.</PARA>

People opposite that I used to hear chanting, `Make the rich pay,' will now not let them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do you realise that if universities take one per cent of their students from full fee paying students they will get an extra $17 million. As they take up two per cent and three per cent of full fee paying students in addition to their government funded load, with penalties if they try to sell places without filling their government load, every per cent they go up will pour more and more millions of dollars not into general revenue but straight into universities. So people opposite who want to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2951"> put a block on that are putting a block on putting more money into higher education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are people out there who are prepared to pay. If you do not want to let them pay, if you do not want that money to go to universities, then you argue that case publicly. I am happy to argue the case that if there are people out there prepared to pay, and if we let overseas students pay, why won't we let Australian students pay and why won't we let Australian universities have that extra income and put that income towards improving universities. You run your argument if you want and you ask yourselves whether you think it will be successful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, there are more flexibilities provided to Australian universities. Under the previous government, if universities made the mistake of over&hyphen;enrolling&mdash;which they often did, because you penalised them when they under&hyphen;enrolled&mdash;you would not give them the HECS contribution that you had taken from those students. You just took that HECS contribution and you put it straight into general revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We want to change that. We want to say to universities, `If you over&hyphen;enrol, and we take a HECS contribution from those students, we'll give it back to you.' So the universities are going to be in a much better position if we can get this package passed.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What makes it even more offensive that this government has betrayed every promise that it made to the higher education tertiary sector is when we consider the remarks of the former higher education spokesperson for the coalition, Senator Hill.

He said:  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Students are concerned because of the government's poor record in this regard. The government makes promises one day and breaks them the next.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Vanstone has said today in the chamber that students in higher education are among the luckiest people in our community. Yes, especially the ones on Austudy!

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government promised to maintain Austudy at real levels; and what have we got? An independent rate age that has increased to 25. We have seen the introduction of stricter eligibility criteria and the removal of benefits for certain students, including homeless students. The government promised to maintain operating grants; and what have they done? Over the next four years over $623 million will be taken out of operating grants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They promised to give the NTEU wage claim top priority; it would be addressed when they got into government. And what have they done? They have not put it on the bottom of the agenda; they are completely <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2952"> ignoring it. And yes, they cleverly promised not to change the arrangements for HECS for existing students. I would like the minister to answer at some point the question of whether that includes moving the goalposts on the threshold. That was another promise: the coalition stated clearly that they would not lower the threshold at which graduates begin to repay their debts. And what have they done? It has been reduced from $28,000 per annum to $20,800. That means families on 88 per cent of the poverty line will be repaying the HECS debts. One&hyphen;income two&hyphen;parent families with a HECS debt will be paying it even if they have not reached poverty line levels. It is an outrage. There is a raft of promises that this government have blatantly breached in relation to higher education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government promised also that they would not allow a university system that was based on elitism or the ability to pay. Senator Vanstone has outlined her vision for higher education in this chamber today: you can purchase a place, buy a place. Look at the language we are using in this debate. We now treat students as consumers; we treat them as clients. What has happened to this parliament's, this government's or this nation's vision of education and training for not only young Australians but all Australians?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Vanstone referred to the luckiest people, the people included in the Wran committee report. I wish the minister were here to correct me if I am wrong, but I understand the Wran report came down in around 1986&hyphen;87.

Do you know what? In the last decade, what is the one target equity group whose participation has not increased in higher education? It is people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If, in fact, a deficit is the most important thing that a budget should deal with&mdash;and I do not agree with that&mdash;why do you only choose to cut? If tax give&hyphen;backs are a large portion of the reason we have got into a budget deficit, why do you only choose to focus your efforts on cuts?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Working Nation was already slashed by $1 billion by the Labor government. It now faces massive cuts, starting with $400 million next year by the coalition. What is the important point here? It never was a new, big spending initiative. In 1993 on budget night, the Greens (WA) said, `There's something wrong with this budget. It's missing at least $5 billion. There's no funded labour program. It was left out of the budget.' Of course, it came up as Working Nation. That makes it easier to pretend that you are cutting from a program which was a big, new spending initiative. It never was and it has already been pared back to what it was before 1993. Now it will not be pared back from a big, new spending initiative; it will be pared back to the pre&hyphen;Whitlam era. Basically, this is the gift to young people in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did the coalition promise youth before the election? Jobs! But what are they delivering? Harassment and blame! One way to do that is to tighten the criteria, increase the difficulties of living within one's means when one does not have a job and then blame the person. And you can call them a cheat, too, because you make the rules tighter.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to contribute to this matter of public importance: the government's betrayal of Australians who are reliant upon higher and other education training programs. Interestingly, we could easily be debating today this government's betrayal of Australians. It is a betrayal because, as others have spelt out, particularly Senator Carr and Senator Stott Despoja, every promise in this area has been broken, with more abandon than any other of the broken promises, by this Howard coalition government introducing a classic Thatcher Tory budget. The budget will have a very dramatic impact on not only Australians but also Australian families and Australian society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It took an immense commitment by the previous Labor government to get the investment into education, higher education, training and skills programs up to the level it was. When we came into office, 37 per cent of children finished year 12; when we left, it was over 80 per cent. Some figures would put it in the high 70s, others into the 80s, depending on where you were in Australia: a massive turnaround. And there were 650,000 places in the tertiary sector when we left office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australians had begun to realise the importance of training, education and skills to the benefit of this society. You cannot talk about recovery of small businesses if people are not able to understand how to run a small business and if they are not skilled and trained to do it. You cannot talk about people taking <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2954"> jobs in high technology if they do not have the training, skills and understanding to do it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The dramatic cuts and the broken promises of Austudy and HECS have been spelt out very well indeed. But I am particularly interested to draw the Senate's attention to two documents that came down on the night of the budget: More Choice for Women and Strengthening Families. Interestingly, both these documents are absolutely silent on education, as though strengthening families does not need to address the question of education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet sometimes the opposition wants to talk about the strain on families through the pressures to work and so on. One of the most important reasons families have a second income, as many thousands of women will tell you, is, `I've gone back to work particularly to ensure adequate education assistance for my children.' That is what they want. What has the coalition done? It has dramatically increased the costs of education on families and individuals. You have actually gone to the core of what families are on about in their investments in their own children's future and that of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These broken promises in education not only cut the education sector and the fabric of our society but they cut what families are on about&mdash;families who are committed to improving the opportunities for their children. That has now been knocked for six by these vicious increased costs and charges on students and tertiary institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the other document that I cited, More Choice for Women, again there is no mention of education. Although Senator Stott Despoja pointed out there may have been evidence of no change in the population of university students, she did not highlight the evidence that one of the great dramatic changes in tertiary sector education is the presence of women. After at least a century of being denied access, forbidden and prevented from getting into secondary education let alone tertiary education, we created opportunities for women which they took up in droves. Even the figures earlier this year showed girls achieving extraordinarily well, achieving higher prizes and results than boys in our <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> schools to the point where people are now wondering about boys' education. Girls and women in tertiary sector employment are also achieving splendidly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has happened? Having just got in they are now going to find that the costs and the charges to maintain their presence are going to dramatically increase. So many of those women entered tertiary education because of our commitment to righting the injustice of the costs and the difficulties for women coming from inadequate training through secondary school. We set up those specific programs directed to equity and justice to assist people with disadvantages, Aboriginal people and, in particular, women. They embraced those opportunities with open arms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is no wonder you do not say anything about education in your More Choice for Women document. There is very little choice for women with these increased charges and the prospect of increased debts. That is what you are giving to women. Many women who are still advancing into tertiary education with some trepidation have to ask themselves, `Gosh, do I anticipate that I can cope with the sort of debt that I will have when I leave the tertiary sector?'  No longer do they have to be able to earn $28,000 before they pay it back; it is now $20,000. These are people who are very well below average weekly earnings. They are struggling with all the other commitments that come with an income of $20,000. Yet they are now going to have to pay back their tertiary education charges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These changes were guaranteed not to happen. There were to be no changes to HECS, no increase in costs, no cutback in services, no restrictions on places and no cuts to operational grants to universities. We have seen absolutely all those promises broken. The damage is already evidenced by the anger portrayed by vice&hyphen;chancellors, university staff and students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Carr said before that the only promise Senator Vanstone has kept is to become the most hated or disliked woman on the government front bench, if not in this country. She has also managed in the space of five short months to completely politicise the tertiary sector. Students who had grown <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2955"> up knowing only a Labor government and wanting or being inclined to sheet responsibility home to a Labor government now know what the facts of a tory government are. It is so much worse. Given the opportunity again, 52 per cent&mdash;according to today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS>&mdash;say that if they had known in March what they know now about Mr Howard's lies, his deception and his broken promises, they certainly would not have voted the way they did then.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what you have done in the tertiary sector. It is the government's betrayal of Australians&mdash;individuals, families and society. There are skillshare cutbacks and training cutbacks. A conservative mayor in the southern region of Adelaide said to me just the other day, `We would never have voted for this lot if we had known they would come into office and tear apart the fabric of the community.' That is what this debate is about. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to speak on the matter of public importance concerning education. It is some time since I have spoken on this area and I am delighted to have the opportunity to highlight the misinformation that the opposition is peddling. It is peddling misinformation about nursing homes and education. The shadow minister for education and youth affairs, Mr Baldwin, released a press release on, I think, 21 August, headed `Government misleads on vocational education'. Let me just say that in that press release what the shadow minister did was mislead the public. The claims made by the shadow minister, Peter Baldwin, were scandalous but they are understandable, I suppose, given the figures you can expect from a graduate of Labor's magic pudding school of budget planning. The first claim Mr Baldwin made is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the face of it, the Budget contained an increase for non&hyphen;government schools of around $210 million over four years, while government schools faced a net cut of around $70 million over the same period.</PARA>
<PARA>Wrong. The budget papers reveal that for 1995&hyphen;96 Commonwealth spending on government schools was $1,124 million. In 1996&hyphen;97 that spending will be $1,167 million, an increase of $43 million or 3.8 per cent. Over <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the next four years, spending will have increased by more than $240 million on government schools. There is no evidence that the states' contribution to filling Beazley's magic pudding fiasco will reduce funding to schools. It is for the states to decide how they make that contribution. In addition to the $305 million of extra funds for literacy, school to work, languages and civics, two&hyphen;thirds will go to government schools. On that claim he was wrong. He also claimed in the press release:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Federal expenditure on literacy&mdash;the need for which Dr Kemp has dishonestly sought to exploit as his own discovery&mdash;is $6 million less than Labor's commitment.</PARA>
<PARA>Wrong. The federal coalition focused on literacy because the previous Labor government had done nothing about it. We have not had a survey of literacy in Australia for the past 16 years but evidence gathered from some of the research that has been done is that literacy in this country has declined. Labor's commitment to literacy was to cut the funding for the early literacy program. When the minister asked the department, `What is going on about the literacy program,' the answer from the department was, `Minister, it was a program for which there was no money in the forward estimates.' What the government is doing is putting in $45 million of extra money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me remind those on the other side that illiteracy is really one of the worst forms of poverty. Literacy opens the door to opportunity and achievement. What Labor was going to do by not having that spending or that funding in the forward estimates was take away from our children the key to opportunity that literacy gives. Literacy opens the door to the whole world. What the previous Labor government did by taking it out of forward estimates was take away that key, in particular from low income families with children, and adults who had difficulty reading. Another claim the shadow minister made was as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The New Schools Policy, under which the Federal Government funds non&hyphen;government schools, will be abolished at a cost of $150 million over four years. This will be done in the name of choice and savings to the public purse, even though it could <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2956"> well reduce choice and will be largely funded by a $128 million cut to government school funding.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>Wrong; wrong again. Claims of changes to non&hyphen;government schools policy are not true. We have always maintained that we will fund school students regardless of whether they are in government or non&hyphen;government schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new schools policy was a travesty. It has been eliminated because it took away and restricted parent choice. It failed damnably. Under the new schools policy the percentage of students in non&hyphen;government schools kept increasing. The policy discriminated against parents whose children were in low cost non&hyphen;government schools that were established in the early 1990s. The policy was abolished in the name of choice but, if parents do not exercise the choice to send their children to non&hyphen;government schools, there will be no change in funding for government schools. So the shadow minister was absolutely wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another claim that the shadow minister made was that, on the face of it, the budget contained an increase for non&hyphen;government schools of around $210 million over four years, while government schools faced a net cut of around $70 million over the same period. Again, that is wrong. The budget papers reveal that in 1995&hyphen;96 Commonwealth spending was $1,124 million, and in 1996&hyphen;97 there will be an increase of $43 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> One of the other issues that have been neglected by the previous government is in regard to young people who are leaving school who do not go on to university, young people who fall between the stools. The minister has indicated there will be a $187 million school to work package, a package which supports and assists young people who are going into the work force from school. The program will involve $80 million to expand vocational education and training in secondary schools; $40 million for workplace training opportunities for students; $38 million for up to 200 work placement coordinators to facilitate structured workplace learning opportunities for students; $23 million for implementing vocational education in schools, including employing extra teachers and professional development for teachers to ensure they have up&hyphen;to&hyphen;date industry experi ence; school based paid apprenticeships and traineeships, and $6 million in the next two years for a jobs pathway guarantee program to support the transition from school to work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The program is part of the federal government's new modern Australian apprenticeship and traineeship system, continuing the reform and streamlining of Australia's trainee system. It will allow students to combine their secondary school certificate with practical work skills and qualifications recognised and valued by a broad range of businesses. That is what employers are asking for. They are asking for young people who come out with literacy skills, who come out with a good basic education, and also come out with an understanding of work and training and skills that will fit them for the workplace. That is what we are doing; not creating mickey mouse jobs but training young people, giving them the sorts of skills that will make them work ready.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another area involving training is the professional development of teachers, an area that has been neglected. Teachers are a group of people who have in their hands an enormous responsibility. When I was teaching I saw it as a great privilege to be able to teach young people. These teachers require a continual upgrading of their professional training and experience. The features&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unfortunately, my allotted time has been cut, but I have to say it is a small price to pay when we consider the massive cuts that this government has implemented in the area of education, and particularly higher education. This is a government that really does not understand the importance of higher education to Australians and to Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a government that has a minister in charge of the higher education portfolio who believes she can determine higher education policy and higher education funding by having a fireside chat. This is a minister whose approach to this most important of portfolios is to sit down, invite the vice&hyphen;chancellors of the universities in and then proceed to try to have an auction sale by saying to them, `Look, we have to have some <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2957"> cuts; what would you want&mdash;five per cent, 10 per cent or 15 per cent?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a total abrogation of responsibility by Senator Vanstone, the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, from virtually the first day she took over the portfolio when she tried to transfer the decision making processes from herself and from her own department on to those persons charged with the running of universities. Of course, they did not buy that because they knew what was going to come; they were not going to sign their own suicide note.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since then we have seen this minister implement one of the most disastrous education policies that one could ever witness. I say to all those government members and senators in this parliament, who in many cases have been the beneficiaries of the great reforms implemented by Labor governments&mdash;commencing with Whitlam and going through to Hawke and Keating&mdash;in the area of higher education, that they should think seriously about what they are doing to the future of young Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With these massive expenditure cuts, you will be reducing by around 30,000 the number of university places that will be available. The government is turning back the clock. In our period of government we almost doubled the number of places, from 350,000 to 630,000. In one year you will reduce that substantially. You are ripping around five per cent out of the higher education budget. You are placing at risk the future of regional universities&mdash;universities in northern New South Wales, in western Sydney and in other states such as Victoria and South Australia particularly. Just as those universities have got off the ground, have got the capital investment and expenditure in them and are attracting more students into higher education, you are threatening their very existence. For instance, of 16,000 student places in regional universities throughout Australia that will go by the board, approximately 2,400 of them are in New South Wales. That will mean a massive reduction of $24 million out of regional universities in New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same story is told throughout all the other states. What is this minister's response? <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> She says, `Oh well, they can get in by paying full fees.' You know that students in those areas, families in those areas, are not going to have the capacity to pay full fees to take up places in universities. This government's ultimate disgraceful approach to regional higher education can be seen when you look at the statement delivered by the Hon. John Sharp on budget day entitled Rebuilding Regional Australia. You will not find one mention anywhere in that document of the word `education'.

<PARA>Today in Senate question time we saw an extraordinary performance by the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) in attacking me for putting out a statement exposing the hypocrisy of the government in breaking their election promise. Senator Alston was asked what would have to be one of the most clumsily worded <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2958"> dorothy dixers ever heard in the Senate. In my view, the way it was worded greatly embarrassed the new President, Senator Reid. The minister was asked to comment about statements I had put out regarding the government's cut to the ABC's funding. The supplementary question was even worse, asking, `Minister, would you care to comment on any other shadow minister you would care to think of?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The President said that she would look at the issue of what constituted relevant questions under the standing orders. We in opposition look forward to her comments and her ruling as a result of that very stupid Dorothy Dix question and the remarks made by the minister. The minister was trying to cover his tracks&mdash;that is the best way I could put it&mdash;on the broken promise of the coalition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the election campaign, it was reported on page 5 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Better Communications</EMPHASIS> of 18 January 1996 that, `The coalition will maintain existing levels of Commonwealth funding to the ABC' and that, `The coalition will maintain the current prohibition on advertising and sponsorship on ABC television and radio.' On the night of the election, after it was clear that the coalition had comprehensively won the election, Senator Alston, as the incoming minister, was interviewed by Jim Middleton on ABC television in front of viewers across Australia watching the telecast. Jim Middleton said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First of all the commitment close to home about the ABC and commitment to maintain funding in real terms over the term of the coming parliament, does that stand?</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Alston said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Absolutely.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Middleton asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even if you discover on Monday that the budget's bottom line is much worse than the government's been saying?</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Alston replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Oh yes. I think John Howard's made it very plain that we want to maintain&mdash;honour&mdash;all our commitments and the ABC is a very important part of that.</PARA>
<PARA>In all of these remarks by Senator Alston there is a clear, unequivocal commitment to maintaining the funding of the ABC. When Senator Alston subsequently had to announce <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the $55 million cut in the ABC's budget over the next three years&mdash;starting next financial year&mdash;he tried to explain, in an interview with Kerry O'Brien on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> , that he was not talking about the triennium; he was talking only about the coming year. But that is not what he said in response to Jim Middleton on the ABC on election night.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Alston has been caught red&hyphen;handed in misleading the Australian people throughout the election campaign and on election night about the coalition's commitment to the ABC. Since election night, we have seen a concerted, deliberate campaign not only by Senator Alston but by the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, and the Treasurer, Mr Costello, in attacking the ABC politically. Senator Alston started off by attacking the management qualities of the ABC. Yet only last year, in the report of a Senate committee which he chaired, he gave the management of the ABC a big tick. The report, which Senator Forshaw has with him now in the chamber, is called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Our ABC</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was their title. Senator Alston chaired the committee and signed off the report, saying that the management of the ABC was okay. Once he became minister, once the political attack started, he began saying that the management had a lot to answer for. That was followed by remarks by Mr Howard, which I think are the most serious remarks, outlining the political intent and outlining what the coalition really thinks of the ABC. Several times&mdash;it was not an accidental slip of the tongue or a Freudian slip&mdash;Mr Howard said that the ABC coverage was biased, that it was too politically correct, and that you heard only one view on the ABC. Subsequently, coalition spokespeople have been reported as saying that, for example, there is too much emphasis on Aboriginal affairs on the ABC. Mr Howard has apparently said that himself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What Mr Howard would like is to have any issues that are uncomfortable to him, or that do not make Australians feel relaxed and comfortable, taken off the ABC altogether. He does not want issues reported and then have people on both sides of the argument put their <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2959"> view. Mr Howard really wants to get down to an almost Orwellian view that nothing that is controversial or uncomfortable to his view of society ought to be reported. That is why he is making those remarks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then, of course, we have the Treasurer, Mr Costello. When the National Commission of Audit report was released&mdash;which, in most areas, the coalition ran 100 miles away from and ignored completely because it had too many uncomfortable things in it for even Mr Costello to contemplate&mdash;it made a suggestion that the funding for the ABC as an institution be removed and that all programming money be put out to competition. This would gut the ABC and would mean that we would no longer have a national broadcaster. That was their recommendation. It was not covered in detail in the report. There was no great explanation about it. It was almost a one&hyphen;paragraph throw&hyphen;away line, but Mr Costello chose to emphasise those remarks in his statement at the time of the release of the audit report. He chose to say that ABC management is not up to the mark.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We clearly have a pattern. First of all there was a softening up of the public debate by the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Minister for Communications and the Arts attacking the ABC. The next stage of the program was the announcement of the efficiency dividend cut of $10 million to $11 million a year which has been applied to all agencies&mdash;this was immediately a breach of their election promise. But then, of course, we had the sudden announcement, announced boldly and coldly by Senator Alston on behalf of the government, that there would be a cut of $55 million a year starting from next year and that every year thereafter that cut in the base funding would continue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So over the next four years of outlays&mdash;this is not an estimate on our part, but an absolute calculation&mdash;when you put the efficiency dividend cut in, plus the $55 million a year for the following three years, it totals $209 million. Yesterday and the day before Senator Alston was attempting to say that I had that figure wrong in my statement. I think he also tried to say it today. Yet today's Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> has a report on a statement by Mr Brian <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Johns, Managing Director of the ABC, which absolutely confirms the figure I put out in my press release as correct. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Based on the Government's forward estimates, the ABC's funding will be $200 million worse off in today's dollars over the next four years.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Alston is trying to explain to people that the cut only has one year and thereafter it is restored. I do not think he understands that, compared with what we had put in the budget for future outlays and what we had committed ourselves to and what people had expected for the next triennium, there will be a $209 million loss to the ABC. This is not just tinkering and removing a little bit of fat from the edge. This is the deepest and most significant cut to the operation of the ABC since it was formed in the early 1930s. This is going to destroy the ABC as a national broadcaster covering a broad range of programs to a broad range of Australians in all sorts of areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only yesterday in the Senate adjournment debate my colleague Senator Ray paid great tribute to the ABC radio coverage of the Olympic Games from Atlanta saying that it was excellent, that the quality of the broadcast and the commentators were a real credit to the ABC and that it was very informative. He pointed out that, if you make the big cuts to the ABC, the organisation will lose its institutional skills, its memory and its backup to have available the people with such a broad range of skill in broadcasting 30&hyphen;odd different sports at the Olympic Games.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ABC does not just broadcast for a few elite or a few significant minorities; it broadcasts for everybody across Australia. That is in the charter. When the Labor Party was in government back in the 1980s it put legislation through this parliament that gave the ABC a broad based charter for all Australians. That is the charter this parliament adopted. It is the existing charter. But what do we find? On the same day as they announced these drastic cuts to destroy the ABC they announced the appointment of Mr Mansfield to review the charter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One would have thought they would have put the review first and then justified some cuts. This is the classic case of putting the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2960"> cart before the horse. They have put the cuts in anyway, irrespective of what Mr Mansfield may find. Mr Mansfield has terms of reference that almost predict the outcome of the review. They are narrow. They are aimed at restricting the ABC from being a broad based national independent broadcaster.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know whether Mr Mansfield realises what he has stepped into by accepting the invitation of the government to conduct this independent review. Mr Mansfield has had a long, successful history in Australian industry. He was the chief executive of McDonald's fast food chain when it was going through its most expansionary period. He then became chief executive of Optus when it started to become the second telecommunications carrier. Then, for a short period, he was chief executive of Fairfax until he fell out with its foreign owners when he tried to run the company as an Australian company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to be honest, and I do not think Mr Mansfield would dispute this: Mr Mansfield does not have much of a history or interest indicated in Australian public broadcasting. Nevertheless, he has had broad experience in industry and he is conducting this review. I suspect he was more than a little surprised at the immediate public reaction around Australia to the announcement of the cuts in the ABC, the appointment of himself and those rigged terms of reference which the government gave him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been rallies of tens of thousands of people in Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne, Adelaide, Fremantle, and so on. I attended one in Fremantle. What was striking about those rallies was not that a small group of people from one segment of our community turned up but that&mdash;and this is from my observations at the rally in Fremantle&mdash;the group that turned up was notable in its diversity. There were people ranging from those who were clearly what I would consider to be coalition supporters to those who would be well to the left of the Labor Party. There were young people, old people, ethnic representatives, working class people, retirees, and so on. You name it, they were represented in the audience. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the meeting after the guest speakers had spoken, those people had a chance to make their views known. I had never heard for a very long time such passion from all these people when they stood up at the microphone and articulated their views. `Leave the ABC alone', `Restore the cuts', `It's our ABC', they were saying to the government, and in particular to Senator Alston&mdash;`Leave it as it is'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that some members of the coalition consistently complain about ABC bias in some form or another. We all, as politicians, complain about bias when we do not quite get our press release read out the way we would like. That is the nature of the beast. That will always be the case. But from time to time there have been just as many people in the Labor Party who have been upset about the way the ABC has covered something as there have been on the other side.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, what I think is most noteworthy is that all the surveys show the bulk of the ABC traditional audience being coalition supporters. Despite the so-called bias that Mr Howard goes on about, coalition voters are the ones who overwhelmingly are the listeners and viewers of the ABC. Despite Mr Howard's concern about bias, they continue to listen to and watch the ABC. I believe that coalition voters by these actions have told Mr Howard: we do not think the ABC is biased because we like listening to it and watching it. Absolutely, and in one fell swoop, those surveys have destroyed Mr Howard's own argument about bias.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2961"> I would say also that in non-metropolitan Australia, in regional Australia, probably 90 per cent of listeners to the ABC, particularly in some rural areas, would be coalition or National Party supporters. What I have seen sometimes of ABC rural and regional radio, the local radio station, in western New South Wales or in the Riverland area of South Australia is that, because the local federal member and state member are overwhelmingly coalition members, they get an extraordinary run of their statements being broadcast&mdash;as they should. From the Labor Party point of view, we do not get an equal say; unfortu nately, of course, we are not the elected members in those areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But to say that the coalition is being harshly dealt with by the ABC in rural and regional Australia is hypocrisy; it is just madness. All the evidence goes to the opposite. I ask rural Liberal members and anyone from the National Party, in particular: give us examples of occasions when your press release was not run, when you did not get a chance to make a comment on the ABC regional morning news service when you had something sensible to say. They cannot give one example.</PARA>

That would be your fault, Senator O'Chee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One area where some people in the coalition&mdash;not all, but some&mdash;get themselves stirred up is programs, innovative programs like the new Triple J network which has spread across Australia. We have Mr Bradford, the member from the Gold Coast area, publicly asking that the ABC completely close down Triple J because occasionally it uses some four-letter words&mdash;occasionally. Triple J occasionally talks about things about which he feels uncomfortable, and so on. But I say to Mr Bradford, the coalition and everyone else: do they realise that each week 2.5 million to 2.8 million young Australians listen to Triple J? What an astonishing performance; what an astonishing consumer reaction, if you want to put it that way. The young people of Australia have voted with their ears: they want to listen to Triple J.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where are the biggest audiences for Triple J now occurring? On the regional network that Triple J, under the policies of the previous government, was able to spread throughout Australia. We were very proud to be able to give Triple J the chance to become a national network station. Young people in the rural areas are voting with their ears by <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> turning on Triple J. They find that Triple J is talking about issues that are relevant to them and their lifestyle&mdash;issues that are important to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But Mr Bradford, a back bench Liberal member, I will concede&mdash;and thank goodness for that&mdash;wants to close it all down. Does he realise that of the total ABC radio audience each week Triple J has half? The audiences of all the rest of the ABC radio stations comprise about 2 million people. Triple J is the other half of the total audience&mdash;which, again, is an amazing success.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point about Triple J which I want to mention is that it is not just about passive listening, the putting out of music. It is about promoting young Australian rock-and-roll popular music; it is about developing Australian culture in popular music. I am told that Silverchair, that popular band from Newcastle for young people, first got its break on Triple J&mdash;and I have to admit that, as I turn 50 this year, Mr Acting Deputy President, it may be a bit beyond my league.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to just mention Silverchair because they got their break when they were played live on Triple J across Australia and developed an audience who went out and bought their records. As a result, they went international and have sold millions of records in the United States. They have brought income into this country that has helped our balance of budgets. That young band from Newcastle is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2962"> an export earner for Australia. It is the equivalent of a large-sized company bringing in millions of dollars. That one company has brought more dollars into Australia in export earnings than it cost the ABC to run the whole of Triple J for one year. It is an extraordinary performance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What do we see in this budget? We see not only the attack on the ABC generally but also the fact that the money we gave through Creative Nation last year to promote and unearth new rock&hyphen;and&hyphen;roll bands in Australia for Triple J has been abolished in the budget. Talk about being blind to the opportunities to promote export earnings, because Australian rock and roll music&mdash;popular music&mdash;has a reputation round the world, not only in North America and Europe but also in Asia. It is a major export earner of which we should be very proud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The ABC is one of those institutions in Australia that everybody has a view about. From time to time we all admit that we disagree with it. It is open to endless criticism; it is open to argument and debate; and it has management inefficiencies. In any organisation as big as the ABC and with a budget as large as it has, there is no doubt that somewhere in the organisation there will be a manager who is not doing his job absolutely the way he should be. There will be some wastage of money and that should all be looked at. They should always be aiming to improve the management and the structure. There may be too many middle managers and more money should be put into actual programs&mdash;all of those arguments&mdash;but we have to say that Senator Alston said last year that the management was basically okay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to recognise that the ABC is one of those institutions that create a national character and a national binding of Australians together. In a modern society, with all the tensions and all the difficulties that are around, it is very important for us to support those institutions that maintain and develop the national character and the national identity of Australia. I cannot think of any organisation that does it more than the ABC. There may be some that equal it, but there would be none that surpass it in creating that national <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> image and in helping to identify that national character.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The ABC does it not only on the cultural side but also by the very presence of its current affairs and news services so that information on major events is broadcast around Australia. The reporting of this parliament today will be shown right around Australia so that, no matter where you are, the national parliament can be seen on the television or heard on the radio. I might not like the way that they have reported my speech today or whether they even reported it, but the point is that it is the institution that spreads the word and that gives out the information in a very effective way. If you damage the ABC, you damage the very fabric of Australia and the way in which that national identity, that national unity, can not only be preserved in the end but also be enhanced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the government has made a catastrophic error in announcing these cuts. I think it did it on a petty, vindictive basis to get even with the so-called perception of bias in the ABC. But I do not think the government realises the consequences of what it is doing to the country of which it is now the elected government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An example of what I think is the support for the ABC in all quarters is that about four weeks ago I was driving one Saturday night back to my home from country South Australia and I turned on ABC FM fine music on the car radio. They were broadcasting live the final of the Sydney International Piano Competition&mdash;a world-class event which went for four weeks involving something like 40 or 50 pianists&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course. I then find it even more extraordinary, Senator Patterson, that the coalition would put at risk the ABC and its future and such a network as the ABC FM fine music network. The interesting thing is that, when the announcer thanked everybody and in particular thanked the ABC fine music network for making this a national event, the applause from the audience for the ABC was bigger than even for the actual winner. I find that a very interesting indication. I suspect that the bulk of that audience listening in the Sydney Opera House were overwhelmingly coalition supporters like Mrs Bishop; yet, when they had a chance to show their support for the ABC, they applauded long, loud and hard. When the organiser was interviewed later on, he again made the point that the Sydney International Piano Competition could not exist if it were not for the ABC, which has made it an international event.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the programs; these are the cultural things that are under attack by this drastic $55 million a year cut to the ABC budget. It costs $3&half; million to run Triple J across Australia. Even if you did knock that off, you would still need another $52 million savings somewhere else. ABC FM fine music probably costs $4 or $5 million a year to run. They are the savings you are going to find in closing down all of those sorts of programs to get to the total of $55 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amount of $55 million is more than the total cost that the ABC spends each year on Australian drama. No more Australian drama on ABC television? That would be catastrophic. We all know that Australian TV drama now has a world reputation in that the producers, the writers, the actors and the directors who learnt their skills in the ABC television drama department are now recognised as being world class.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was told the other day that one of our Oscar winners, Mr Semmler, the photographer for <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Dances with Wolves</EMPHASIS>, started his career as a cameraman for the ABC in Riverland, South Australia. He went on to win an Oscar and is now one of the world's top cinematographers. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Where did he get his training? He got it in the ABC. If there had been no institutional structure he would not have got training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my view, one of the great heroes of modern times is writer and journalist Neil Davis, the Australian who died in 1985 covering a coup in Bangkok. He stayed behind to watch the North Vietnamese army roll into Ho Chi Minh City. He covered the war in Cambodia. In the end he covered too many wars and unfortunately and tragically was killed. Where were his beginnings? They were in Hobart where he learnt his job as a photographer for the news service in the Hobart studios of the ABC. He went on to become one of the most recognised war correspondents and photographers in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what the ABC did for people. It provided the infrastructure and institution. What are we going to do when you destroy the structure of the ABC and remove that institution? You will diminish Australia substantially. You will remove our national identity. You will remove the cultural input of an organisation that has been so effective in developing an Australian character.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is astonishing that for petty political reasons and base motives, led by the Prime Minister, the ABC is now going to lose $209 million from its budget over the next four years. I say on behalf of the opposition that we will campaign endlessly to get that decision changed. I think we can get it changed because, in the end, too many Australians, including coalition supporters, will not let this drastic, catastrophic attack on the ABC be successful.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the motion moved by Senator Schacht relating to the ABC. I find it interesting that Senator Schacht is speaking about this today and is indignant about the fact that there have to be cuts to a large range of services and government programs when I think about the waste that occurred when Labor was in government. Sometimes the amounts must have seemed small to the Labor Party, but they added up to the sort of amount that we are now looking <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2964"> at taking out of the ABC's budget. I note that Senator Schacht is now leaving the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think of the millions of dollars that were lost in the Midford debacle and the millions that had to be paid out by the public as a result of his ineptitude as a minister. Another example is the $5 million, which I pursued, that was spent in selling the disability reform package. The company was insolvent when it got the contract. I could give example after example of the mismanagement that we endured under the previous Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are now being called to account for that. We have a responsibility to the next generation. One of the reasons I came into parliament was that when I was growing up&mdash;and Senator Schacht and I are about the same age&mdash;the world was my oyster. Whatever I wanted to do I could do. As I got a bit older I saw those opportunities slipping away for young Australians&mdash;the sorts of kids who now listen to Triple J. They do not have the same opportunities that many of us in this chamber had when we were growing up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is because we have wasted golden opportunities. The Labor Party wasted quarter after quarter of growth. It took no advantage of that. We have been left with a budget deficit. We have a hole of $8 billion to $10 billion. That is the reason we are discussing this today. No&hyphen;one likes to be involved in looking at programs and deciding where cuts have to be made. Even the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Bernie Fraser, indicated that it is possible to make adjustments of $4 billion in each of the next two years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We admit that the ABC is one of Australia's primary institutions with a very significant and valued role to play in the Australian community. The government wants the ABC to continue doing what it does best. We will ensure that it remains an independent national broadcaster delivering quality programming to audiences as efficiently as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the opposition to come in here and say that we are going to destroy the ABC is absolutely wrong. Belts will have to be tightened. An assessment will have to be made of the various programs. A process has been put in place to do that, and I will discuss <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that in a moment. We have to tighten our belts and the ABC cannot be quarantined from that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I move on to discuss the cuts that are being put forward, I will quote what Gareth Evans said about cuts to the ABC in 1988 when he was Minister for Transport and Communications. Senator Schacht has not mentioned that the Labor government made cuts to the ABC. Gareth Evans said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While there has been some decline in funding for the ABC over the past two Budgets, as compared with the peak year of 1985&hyphen;6 . . . this does not reflect any loss of affection for the ABC or any decision to squeeze it harder than anyone else&mdash;the absence of new policy approvals has been a function of the pressure which has been applied universally to government departments and agencies.</PARA>
<PARA>We have inherited a problem that resulted from the previous Labor government's mismanagement. The words Gareth Evans used in 1988 when outlining cuts to the ABC apply now. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This does not reflect any loss of affection for the ABC or any decision to squeeze it harder than anyone else . . . a function of the pressure which has been applied universally to government departments and agencies.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>This comment from Gareth Evans rebuts completely the motion put forward by Senator Schacht. It is exactly the point that the government has been trying to get across.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ABC will receive around $530 million in 1996-97 and $500 million in 1997-98. I have to say that we are taking a $10 million cut here in Parliament House. We do not walk around saying, `Parliament will have to close down because we have taken a $10 million cut.' We have had to tighten our belts, make some savings and adjust to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The funding I outlined before&mdash;the $530 million in 1996-97 and $500 million in 1997-98&mdash;represents a very strong commitment in a time when financial restraint is necessary. It seems extreme to argue that $&half; billion a year in funding for a quality national broadcasting service is destructive. That $&half; billion will not mean that the ABC will be destroyed. It puts paid to the opposition's claims that the cuts will destroy the ABC.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2965">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the introduction of triennial funding in 1988, funding has been relatively stable. It has declined marginally as a result of the efficiency dividends in 1988-89 and 1989-90, but it is possible to address these cuts&mdash;and many people have indicated this, even from within the ABC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition is making the claim that we have got in it for the ABC because we think that it is biased. I try not to think that, but it is very hard sometimes when you have David Salter, an ABC employee, saying last Sunday:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Broadcasting philosophies come and go. Governments come and go. We will get the bastards.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not think that that is an appropriate term to use in the chamber, but that is what he said. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Two years from now we will be as strong as ever.</PARA>
<PARA>In the May 1996 Green Guide I was quite amazed to find a little quotation about the 1996 election. The Green Guide said in the box entitled `The file on "Lateline"' under the subheading `The toughest show to do':</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 1996 federal election. At 6.45pm, Anthony Green and his computer called the win for the Liberal Party. "I said nothing, and Kerry (O'Brien) said nothing. It was almost as if we couldn't comprehend it."</PARA>
<PARA>That was Maxine McKew.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know people in the industry&mdash;and this is true for any industry&mdash;have a position, but I think they have an obligation to keep those views to themselves and to behave in a non-partisan way. It is exactly the same responsibility as other people have. For example, if teachers in tertiary institutions have a particular philosophy, my view is that they should educate the students, give them the various options and give them the skills to choose. To try to inculcate them with your views is not appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us face it, we can cope with that. The Labor Party sometimes cries foul that the ABC is biased and that there have been all sorts of complaints from various avenues. I ask that the ABC attempt to present its information in the most non-partisan way possible. But to say that we are having a go at the ABC because we think it is biased, as has been claimed, is totally inappropriate.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government made a commitment to maintain existing levels of Commonwealth funding to the ABC. Senator Schacht has said that we have not kept that commitment. Despite the pressure to make budget savings&mdash;and some areas have been asked to make those savings immediately&mdash;we agreed to maintain ABC funding for the remainder of the current triennium, less the generally applied two per cent cut in running costs, which the government clearly signalled in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meeting our commitments</EMPHASIS>, which was released on 15 February.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we told people that there would be a two per cent across&hyphen;the&hyphen;board cut&mdash;and that represented to the ABC a $10.8 million ongoing reduction&mdash;and then we announced a reduction in the ABC's funding of $55 million in 1997-98, which is the beginning of the next triennium. We have kept our commitment to maintain their funding until the end of that triennium unlike what we have had to do in other areas. That again was not mentioned by Senator Schacht.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for long-term guarantees, we did not see the previous Labor government giving long-term guarantees to the ABC. I would like to read to you what Senator Schacht said in this chamber on 24 February in 1988. I think sometimes he forgets what he said&mdash;we all forget, and it comes back to haunt us&mdash;during the debate on a matter of public importance regarding the ABC. If you stay here long enough, what comes around comes around. Senator Schacht said in that debate on 24 February:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is all very well for the Democrats to claim that the ABC is being reduced by funding. This Government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>sic&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">has to make tough decisions about priorities right across the board in the running of this country, providing money for many different worthwhile projects. It is no good for the running of this country if, to make oneself feel good, one says that the ABC will get another $100m, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation will get another $50m, et cetera. Once one goes through that list, sane economic management of this country will come to an end.</PARA>
<PARA>He has answered his own question. I could not have said better what Senator Schacht said here. You just cannot keep saying yes and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2966"> nod to every program the government runs. It is not sane economic management, as he says. Let me tell you that we have not had sane economic management of this country for the past 13 years. Thank heavens the Australian public had the good wit and the will to elect us to implement some sane economic management. If we get it right&mdash;and I am sure we will&mdash;the ABC should be thinking about how to expand its programs in the future. But, for the time being, it is difficult for us to do that given the legacy that we have been left by Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I agree with what Senator Schacht said on that occasion: the government does have to make tough decisions about priorities right across the board in running the country and provide money for many projects which are worth while. We promised to improve the economy and the situation of Australia for all Australians, and that is what we are doing. We are making these cuts not because we want to, not to fix our mistakes, but because we have to, it is economically responsible to do so and, finally&mdash;and this is more to the point&mdash;to make up for, to correct, the mistakes of Labor's mismanagement. We did not enjoy making the cuts; however, we have to overcome the irresponsibility of the previous Labor government and get Australia back on track.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also remind the opposition that, had they been honest about the state of the economy before the election, we could have allowed for it in making our policies in relation to funding for all areas, including the ABC. In light of the fact that it is budget week, I remind the chamber of the deception of the previous government in hiding the immense size of the budget deficit until after we came into power. In the May budget last year, in 1995, Labor announced a surplus. I can remember the headlines. There was euphoria about a surplus of $720 million for 1995-96 and a headline surplus of $3.4 billion for 1996-97. What a joke! Do you remember that, Senator Herron and Senator Panizza&mdash;a $720 million surplus? That is what they told us and ran out and told the press.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They now have the gall to come in here and talk about our management when they were <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> so far out of the ballpark it did not matter. They were off the planet. Then they had to do a bit of rejigging. In December 1995 we got a bit of a course correction. If those opposite had been on a spaceship orbiting the earth, they would have been off to Mars. That is a popular place to go at the moment, and that is where this opposition ought to have gone a long time ago, because they put Australia so far off course it did not matter. We were right off course. They had a bit of a rejig, they got themselves back in line and they told the public and the financial markets that, oops, they made a mistake, that we did not have a $720 million surplus&mdash;only a $115 million surplus. So we went from having a $720 million surplus to a $115 million surplus. They rejigged it to get back on course a bit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From this point on, when the coalition realised things were going from bad to worse, we called on Labor to release updated Treasury estimates of the budget position. Labor maintained that this could not be done, arguing that the figures were not available, still leaving us to believe we were going to be in surplus. We had some doubts about that, but what did Mr Keating say? `Trust me.' Unfortunately, the Australian public did for far too long, but then they saw the light. The figures were not available right up until the week of the election. That argument was used right throughout the campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As it turned out, Labor were hiding the truth. The figures would have been available but they wanted to maintain the deception that we were still in surplus. On Monday, 4 March, two days after the election, the Prime Minister, John Howard, and the Treasurer, Peter Costello, were fully briefed by Treasury. On 12 March, the Treasurer, Peter Costello, released the revised Treasury budget estimates for 1995-96. These revised estimates revealed that the budget for 1995 had moved from a surplus of $720 million to&mdash;we were on Mars&mdash;a deficit of $280 million. How on earth can you have a budget surplus of $720 million and then in February&mdash;not even the end of the year&mdash;be $280 million out of kilter? And you have the gall to stand over there and criticise us for reining in spending.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2967">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not only that. There is another issue. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> a week or two ago said that this issue would be forgotten on budget week. Not only do we have Beazley's black hole but the government's public debt trebled over the past four years, under the former government, to almost $100 billion&mdash;more than half of the grand total of $185 billion. Also, during 1995-96, we Australians and taxpayers paid $10 billion in interest payments. People out there in the community understand that our paying $10 billion a year is making no dent at all on what we owe. People who have a mortgage on their house know what their interest payments are and that huge repayments, especially at the beginning of paying off their mortgage, seem to make no dent in the capital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have done is borrow money for recurrent spending. This is not money borrowed for infrastructure that is going to make a difference; this is money borrowed to pay for recurrent expenditure. It is like paying for fairy floss: it disappears. We have nothing to show for it, nothing to build on. We are paying $10 billion in interest. If we had reduced that debt and our interest payments were less, we would have half of that money. We would have the money to pay for the ABC and to do the things that we would have liked to have done in government. Until we correct that situation we will be paying that $10 billion year in, year out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We on this side have no intention of permitting that to continue. If we did that, we would be selling the next generations of Australians short. They are the ones who will be left to repay that debt. With fewer of us working, with fewer of us contributing to taxation, as the population ages, we will leave the next generation with a debt and an interest bill which they will not be able to jump over.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Schacht can stand there and talk about kids listening to Triple J. I would love them to be able to listen to Triple J. My staff listen to Triple J. When my younger brothers get into my car they turn on Triple J. Those young listeners of Triple J will inherit a debt if we do not do something about it. And this government is determined to do something <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> about it so that, when those young people who listen to Triple J are our age, they will not be in the situation we are in now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even before the recent announcement that we were going to have to make some cuts to the ABC, the ABC Managing Director, Brian Johns, had acknowledged that there was a need for a fundamental restructuring of the organisation in order to assist the process of creative renewal and to position the corporation for what will be a radically different media environment. Many of the hard decisions the ABC has recently made are the result of the corporation's $13.5 million budget blow&hyphen;out and not the government's $10 million funding cut. In fact the ABC issued a press release on 31 March outlining this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the other moves that the minister has made to acknowledge the problems facing the ABC in addressing the tightening of their belt is in relation to the fact that the ABC will need guidance and assistance on those activities which are the community's highest priority. Acknowledging that, the minister has established a review of the ABC under Mr Mansfield to redefine and to reposition the future direction of the ABC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This morning I was listening to the ABC and heard Mr Mansfield being interviewed, which should give many of the people who have concerns great comfort. He was talking about a lot of aspects. He talked about the need to address the issue of rural and remote areas. He talked about a number of concerns that have been expressed to me by people who are avid listeners of the ABC, and obviously Mr Mansfield is going to address those.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The terms of reference of the review stress factors such as the importance of the independence of the ABC, that it be a high quality service and the importance of services to rural and remote communities and other significant groups not well served by the broadcasting services. The outcome of the review will be reported to the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator Richard Alston, by the end of next year. In making its report, the review will be seeking the views of ABC <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2968"> audiences, the public broadcasters themselves and other interested parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to some of the aspects of the review, this review will reposition and redefine the national broadcaster for the 21st century. This is something that is absolutely vital, as we see enormous changes taking place in information technology, especially in the area of broadcasting. The government's priority is to ensure that quality programming is delivered to audiences as efficiently as possible. The government has made it clear in the terms of reference and directly to Mr Mansfield in undertaking the review the priority it places on services to rural and remote communities as well as to children and other significant groups not well served by other broadcasting services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The review is timely. The ABC is facing major challenges in maintaining its output across the current range of its activities. As I said before, these difficulties have been acknowledged by the ABC Managing Director. The review will provide the opportunity for a wide range of views about the ABC&mdash;a broadcasting organisation that is broadcasting in a changing environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been 15 years since the last independent review of the ABC&mdash;the Dix review. The broadcasting and communications environment has changed immeasurably. Not only is there greater competition amongst broadcasters but there has been a significant increase in the nature and availability of other forms of audiovisual entertainment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has had to make difficult decisions in achieving the necessary reductions in Commonwealth funding, following its revelation about the budget blow&hyphen;out, as I mentioned. In examining the ABC and the very significant future funding pressures which its many activities are likely to place on the budget, the government has decided that the current level of funding cannot continue indefinitely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason we have put this review in place is to make sure that as many of the programs and services of the ABC as possible are maintained and are delivered in an efficient way. I want to read out what Mr Gareth Evans, the then minister for transport and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> education, said in a debate on the ABC's future.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, I will respond to that interjection. We are now talking about the function and role of the ABC. Some of the goals and roles, irrespective of whether it was 1988 or it is 1996, have not changed. There have been some developments of course and there have been some changes. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . nobody has suggested that the Government and Parliament should not have a decisive role in defining the ABC's role and objectives, as set out in its legislative Charter. And however much we might all hope that resources and funding problems could solve themselves without having to be the subject of any kind of political involvement, the reality is that the Government and Parliament will go on being involved, year by year, in decisions that are obviously crucial for the ABC's future, and in particular its capacity to translate those Charter objectives into real&hyphen;world activity.</PARA>
<PARA>He also said in that same speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We simply cannot seriously or sensibly address the question of funding for the ABC without at the same time looking seriously and sensibly at its role and objectives. . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly what the coalition is doing in setting up this review: looking at the roles and objectives of the ABC. So, in conjunction with having to address the budget constraints that are placed upon us, what we are doing in a responsible way is putting into place a review&mdash;with enormously wide consultation input from the community&mdash;of the various roles of the ABC, the various groups to whom the ABC appeals and the groups of people it reaches to ensure that with a budget of approximately half a billion dollars the very best service is given to the Australian community through the services of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have already mentioned, the government has the task of getting Australia back on track by overcoming the debt and economic <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2969"> mismanagement left by the previous Labor government. We did not create these problems but we will be responsible. We will do what is best for Australia and fix the mess that Labor has left us with. The ABC is one of Australia's primary institutions, with a very significant and valued role to play in Australian life. We recognise this and, as a government, we remain committed to the ABC. I look forward to the findings of the review, which will shape the future of the corporation. We will ensure that it remains an independent broadcaster delivering quality programming to audiences as efficiently as possible.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(5.30 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Patterson has just enlightened us with some quotes from former senator Gareth Evans. I would like to requote something that has already been said. It is a quote from the current minister, Senator Alston, from election night when he was on the ABC election coverage. Jim Middleton of the press gallery asked him, `Do you maintain your commitment to the ABC continuing real funding over the life of this parliament&mdash;that is, three years?' The answer from Senator Alston: `Absolutely.' Then Mr Middleton came back with: `What if you find out that the budget is much worse?' And the answer was: `John Howard has made it clear we are honouring all our commitments.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After all of that, on Kerry O'Brien's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS>, Senator Alston said that he saw no contradiction between that and in fact doing the complete and utter opposite. I do see a contradiction, an extreme contradiction. And, what is more, most Australians see a very solid contradiction in that and they are very upset, extremely upset, about that contradiction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this government is doing with the ABC funding is taking away the independence of the public broadcaster through funding cuts of this magnitude. Have no doubt about it: they are enormous. When Senator Patterson said that the Labor Party is not innocent in this, she was dead right. The last government cut down on the ABC too.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ABC is one of the few organisations in this country that have just been cut and cut and cut. They have been cut and then given <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> extra duties in their charter by every parliamentary party in this parliament. They have been given one&hyphen;off allocations of funding to carry out those extra duties and, after those one&hyphen;off allocations of funding are gone, they are told, `Keep carrying out the extra duties but we are not giving you any more money to do it with.' The ABC is one of the few organisations in this country that have been consistently cut over years and years and told to do more with less.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is all very well to say that we have to trim off more fat. There is no more fat on the ABC; there just is not. We are trimming muscle, skin and bone; we are starting the amputations&mdash;it is pretty ugly. So here we have the ABC now being told, `Okay, carry out your own execution. We are not going to tell you&mdash;oh, we are going to tell you a little bit about where that execution is going to come from.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will just read from the budget statements. On page 3.131 of budget paper No. 1, there are a few reductions. The paper says `Cessation of extension of the "Unearthed" new music project', so `Unearthed', which, as Senator Schacht told us, is the project which goes around Australia and finds new youth music and is very successful, has gone. `Cessation of extension of Radio Triple J coverage': so if you cannot get Triple J now, just forget it; you are not going to get it in the future. This is despite the fact that Triple J is extraordinarily popular with young people. If those young people do not vote already, they will do so very soon. Just keep that in mind. Radio Triple J has an Internet site: let me say that it had an Internet site up until this budget. That has gone too. So the ABC is being told a few of its own execution points, but it is not being told all of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On page 3.132 you see: `Reduced Budget Funding for the ABC.' It is to be down $55 million in 1997&hyphen;98, down another $55 million in 1998&hyphen;99 and down another $55 million in 1999&hyphen;2000. This government is saying to the ABC, `You be your own executioner. You chop off a leg or an arm, or maybe a couple. You decide which ones; it is not our fault. And when it comes to the next election we will blame you for it.'</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2970">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is reducing independent funding for an independent broadcaster and that of course simultaneously increases the power of already powerful media barons that we have in this country, because they own almost all of the rest. So we have one large independent media body which has an enormous diversity of interests inside it. And there probably is a bit of bias here and a bit of bias there: a bit of bias for the ALP on this side and the Liberal Party on that side; and the Nationals here and the Democrats there&mdash;goodness knows who else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point about the ABC is that that is all allowed to exist inside the one organisation and there are very few people who can order anybody in the ABC to do anything in an editorial sense, and they do not do it; they would not get away with it. If somebody came to the people on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> and told them they would not be running a particular story because somebody did not like it, then the next story on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> or the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> would be about somebody coming to tell them not to run the story because somebody did not like it. That is the way it works on the ABC. That is why bias is such a silly thing to say about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the level of concentration of media ownership in Australia, it has really dire consequences and it is absolutely stupid and short&hyphen;sighted to cut down independent funding to an independent broadcaster because a government that increases the power of media barons, which is what it does if it does that, increases that power over itself. You are giving people power over yourself. Does the government really believe that media barons are going to be any more favourable to it compared with the so&hyphen;called political bias that it believes it is subjected to by the ABC? We all believe we are subjected to bias. In certain circumstances, we all are. I could name a couple of programs I really did not like that I thought were biased against me. Maybe they were but there were a lot of other programs that I did not think that about, that I thought were absolutely fair and reasonable. And that will happen with everybody and every party. I can name you whole newspapers that I think <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are biased against me, and they probably are too.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will go back to the motion of Senator Schacht. Let me reiterate what the coalition said in its policy statement, in Better Communications. Let me recommend to coalition members and particularly to Senator Alston that he reads his own policy document, because it is a very good one and there are a lot of policies in there that I think changed people's minds when they were deciding how to vote. I will just read out a few things:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition will maintain the existing levels of Commonwealth funding to the ABC and SBS, and retain triennial funding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It supports the ongoing extension of Triple J into regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>There's a good one:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It supports the ongoing extension of Triple J into regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>But, according to budget statement No. 1, it has ceased the ongoing extension of Triple J into regional Australia. What a pity. Continuing:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will ensure Australia Television has a long term future in the Asia Pacific region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will fund the ABC and SBS directly for its transmission costs.</PARA>
<PARA>There's another interesting one. The budget for the National Transmission Authority has been cut by $28 million because its functions have been given to the ABC. So the government is not spending $28 million to fund the NTA. But guess what? It is not giving that $28 million that the NTA actually costs to the ABC to carry that out. The ABC will have to find that somewhere too.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the ABC's funding will not drop by just that $55 million over the next three years. Its funding will not go down by the ridiculously called efficiency dividend&mdash;at which point does it become inefficient when you are down to a zero budget? Its funding has not just been chopped by that. It has also been chopped by that $28 million that it will have to find somewhere if it is to carry out its own transmission costs which the coalition promised in its election document to fund directly. Back to the election promises:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will provide $6 million for the captioning of ABC and SBS news services. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2971"> </PARA>
<PARA>Guess what? It did provide money for the captioning of ABC and SBS news services. I do not have time to read through this to see whether it was $6 million; but there was some money for that in the budget. There you go, there is one promise that may have been kept to a certain extent. I am very pleased to see it. Continuing:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition is committed to maintaining the ABC's comprehensive radio network.</PARA>
<PARA>If it is committed to maintaining it, I do not know how it is going to do it with $55 million less from its running budget this year and next year, another $55 million the year after and another $55 million the year after that. Continuing:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will maintain the current prohibition on advertising and sponsorship on ABC television and radio.</PARA>
<PARA>There's a good one. I heard recently that that is open for negotiation as well. It might be open for negotiation through the House of Representatives, but I certainly hope that it is not open for negotiation through the Senate&mdash;it certainly will not be through me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are strong policies and they are good policies. I am absolutely positive that they caused voters to decide to vote for the coalition. What a mistake that was. If there is a double dissolution, I can tell you people will not forget that. The coalition will have to keep going the full three years for people to forget what happened here. People love the ABC with an absolute passion. You would be surprised how much they love the ABC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats are committed to the maintenance of the funding for the ABC&mdash;on the existing triennial basis. We are still looking for ways that we can help achieve that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ABC is one of the strongest and most relevant organisations in Australia today. I go back to the coalition policy document Better Communications:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this vast network provides a diverse range of programs and performances of cultural value and intellectual integrity.</PARA>
<PARA>That is very true. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ABC has a proud record of offering high quality and diverse programming across a broad spectrum of human interests including news, current affairs, drama, sport and the arts. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>That view is shared by most Australians. Responding to a recent AGB McNair poll on 26 June, 61 per cent opted for the maintenance of government funding for the ABC at existing levels, and 24 per cent on top of that declared the funding should be increased. Eighty&hyphen;five per cent is a powerful majority supporting the work of the ABC. It includes regular and occasional ABC audiences as well as those who never utilise the services of the national broadcaster. It is seen as terribly important to all Australians and Australian life&mdash;and so it should be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was deputy chair of the 1995 Senate Select Committee on ABC Management and Operations which exhaustively examined the ABC inside and out. We saw the ABC&mdash;and this is in the report&mdash;as `sound and providing an independent, diverse and vibrant service'. What is more, looking at our recommendations in that report, the ABC have rectified all the problems that the committee identified except for the one in which they cannot help themselves&mdash;adequate government funding. In that report we identified that government funding of the ABC was not adequate. Senator Alston ought to remember that because he chaired that committee which found that government funding of the ABC was not adequate. It will be a lot less adequate after this budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ABC has had more than its fair share of cuts. There is the two per cent efficiency cuts, the loss of a further $10 million and associated staff reductions. This is not to mention the proposed program cuts to both radio and television. How can a government which states it is fully committed to the national broadcaster&mdash;which we heard about again from Senator Patterson&mdash;whip out the machete and the firebrand and slash and burn the way it is doing?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2972"> We heard from both former speakers about Mr Mansfield's inquiry which seeks to `redefine the role of the ABC', which can probably be read as `seek to make amendments to the ABC charter'. I hope it is not the case that this inquiry has been set up to guarantee certain outcomes. Having met Mr Mansfield, I must say&mdash;I talked to him for about an hour or so&mdash;I find him an honour able man, and I would be very surprised if that was the case. I do not believe he has been told to come out with a certain outcome. I believe the outcome he comes out with, within the terms of reference, will be all his own work. I hope that is the case; I think it probably will be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we can see a couple of problems: the terms of reference are narrow and there are no public hearings, so the inquiry will not hear in a public manner from supporters of the ABC. I can tell the government now that there are far more supporters of the ABC than there are detractors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that it does not happen but it could be the case that an apparent lack of support for the ABC might then be defined as an argument against the ABC&mdash;and the only apparent lack of support would be because submissions are not public because there are no public hearings. So that might lead to the desired conclusion, in the government's mind, that the community wants to downgrade the ABC and divest it of some of its programs, some of its production and some of its services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can tell the government now that the community does not want the ABC downgraded. To show this we can look at the Friends of the ABC rallies all around Australia. They were testimony to that. I went to the Sydney rally in the Domain. It was massive. I got there just before the entertainment started. It was a festival atmosphere but the people I was talking to were really worried. I must say that most of the people I saw and talked to I think were probably coalition voters. I think this is a very big mistake on the part of the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Changes to the ABC charter are not necessarily a bad thing. We have to look at multimedia, convergent technologies and interactive technology. These are things that are rapidly descending on us and something we all have to take note of&mdash;including the ABC. The problems occur with changing the charter if attempts are made to diminish it, and in particular to diminish the independence and scope of the ABC, ensuring that fewer people can hear and enjoy the ABC.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">ABC programs contribute enormously to Australia's sense of national identity. They inform and entertain us and, most importantly, they reflect our cultural diversity. Who else does that? Rural and remote Australians, inner city suburban residents, and older, younger and alternative listeners all rely on the ABC for news, entertainment, information and debate over crucial and important issues, issues that affect every single one of us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ABC consistently delivers high quality Australian product for television and radio. It consistently wins industry awards and accolades in Australia and overseas. Let me remind senators of a few of the television programs that have won awards. They include <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Janus</EMPHASIS>, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Phoenix</EMPHASIS>, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Damnation of Harvey McHugh</EMPHASIS>, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS>, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Frontline</EMPHASIS>, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Foreign Correspondent</EMPHASIS>, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS>. They are just the TV programs and that is not a comprehensive list of those that have won awards. Then we should look at radio. I do not have the list with me; I gave it to the Senate last time I spoke on the ABC. But ABC radio equally has won awards for any number of things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are other programs that are highly popular and that have set benchmarks that commercial channels attempt to match. Remember <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Towards 2000</EMPHASIS> before it became <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Beyond 2000</EMPHASIS> on commercial television? What about the educational dimension of important programs like <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Play School</EMPHASIS>. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Play School</EMPHASIS> is an important program. It wins awards and is something that parents around Australia can barely do without. What about <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bananas in Pyjamas</EMPHASIS>&mdash;something we have actually sold to the USA, a nigh on impossible task.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ABC was the forum that began the huge growth in lifestyle programs. The ABC is our greatest source of innovation and independent broadcasting. It has a significant impact on public and informed opinion. It creates debate and discussion and, most importantly, is not manipulated by anybody. Australia needs every single program and every single production on every single ABC network.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The debate about the ABC is not really a debate about money and jobs&mdash;but they are absolutely crucial. What the debate is really <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2973"> about is the independence of the ABC and the editorial integrity of the ABC. It is about appropriately funding the ABC to enable it to do the things enshrined in its charter: provide news, information, educational programs and a national perspective to cater for intellectual and cultural needs as major, but not sole, priorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me finish by saying that I was one of the participants in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Late Night Live</EMPHASIS> program. Senators will probably remember that Phillip Adams of the ABC did a series of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Late Night Live</EMPHASIS> programs around the country. I was one of the participants in the program in Canberra in the Old Parliament House. Mr Mansfield was there. I think it is to his credit that he turned up. Mr Ian Sinclair from the other place was there&mdash;and it certainly is to his credit that he turned up because it was a difficult one for any member of the coalition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They had booked the old Senate chamber, thinking they would get a few hundred people. In fact, thousands of Canberrans turned out on a freezing night, quite late. They turned up at Old Parliament House and were participants in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Late Night Live</EMPHASIS>, talking about the future of the ABC. The feeling inside that chamber was absolutely electric. Nobody who was there would have forgotten it in a hurry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The range of ages of people who were there, all of them ABC supporters, and the range of backgrounds of the people who came up and talked to me later were enormous&mdash;from young families to teenagers, then all the way up to what used to be known as the blue rinse set. There was a very large contingent of every single age group. That is something we all have to remember when we are considering what we are doing to the ABC. I honestly believe that the government has made an enormous mistake targeting the ABC. And the ABC has been targeted. It is no use saying, `Yes, we all have to bear the pain.' We do all have to bear the pain but why should the ABC have to bear more pain than anybody else? There must be a reason for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Targeting the ABC is not a sensible move on the part of the government. People are not going to forget this, particularly people who work for the ABC now and who will have to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> find other jobs if they can, if these cuts go ahead&mdash;and there are so many cuts across the board in Australia that it is going to be very difficult&mdash;and particularly people who listen to the ABC now. If that is 85 per cent of the population this coalition government is in big trouble. This is something people will not forget. People love the ABC. It comes out again and again when people are asked what they think of the ABC. They have an enormous affection for it and they want it to be there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a bit like Uluru&mdash;they want it to be there whether or not they see it; it is there if they need it. They know that sooner or later they may need the ABC. They are not stupid; they know that media diversity in this country is being diminished day by day. This is a ball that was started rolling like that thing out of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Raiders of the Lost Ark</EMPHASIS>&mdash;and it is very difficult to stop it. Once you have gone past a critical point with media diversity it is very difficult to bring it back. The only thing standing in the way at the moment is the ABC. It is the only thing that will continue to stand in the way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But if we take away funding we take away independence. We take away what we value most about the ABC and what we need most in this country for it to give us: an independent voice in the media. The incredible stupidity of doing such a thing is almost beyond me. If the government persists in doing this, it will rue the day they decided on that course. That cabinet meeting where it was decided that the cuts to the ABC would be vicious and destructive, and would finally finish off the ABC and make sure it did not do nasty things to this government, will go down as a really black day in the annals of this government. If this government continues these funding cuts, it will regret that at the next election and it will keep regretting it until the ABC is put back together again.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Report 345, An Advisory Report on the Income Tax Assessment Bill 1996, the Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Bill 1996 and the Income Tax (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1996</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, it gives me great pleasure to table today Report 345, which is the report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts' inquiry into legislation to replace the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This report details the JCPA's review of three Bills currently before the Lower Chamber. The Bills are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&bull; the Income Tax Assessment Bill 1996;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&bull; the Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Bill 1996; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&bull; the Income Tax (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1996. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2975"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bills are essentially the same as ones introduced and referred to the JCPA in the 37th Parliament. Unfortunately, that Committee did not have an opportunity to complete its inquiry before the general election was called. However, the evidence it gathered was not wasted and has been considered by the current Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact that these Bills rewrite existing law does not diminish their importance. There are few pieces of Commonwealth legislation that affect more Australians than the tax laws. It should be a matter of considerable concern, therefore, that the most significant of these laws&mdash;the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936&mdash;is in danger of collapsing under the weight of its own complexity. This problem is recognised by all&mdash;from taxpayers to the Tax Office.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Act is in desperate need of a comprehensive overhaul. It is over 5,000 pages long, cannot be easily read or understood, no longer has a recognisable structure and has had amendment piled on top of amendment over the last 60 years. The costs to business and individual taxpayers of trying to understand and comply with this law ranges from $3 billion to $6 billion annually. Any reduction in these compliance costs, therefore, will be a significant microeconomic reform.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The defects of the 1936 Act have been known for some time. Indeed, in 1993 the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in Report 326&mdash;a landmark report on the administration of tax law and the operations of the Australian Tax Office recommended that the tax law be simplified.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The then Government accepted that recommendation and the Tax Law Improvement Project was born. The purpose of this project&mdash;known by all as TLIP&mdash;was, and is, to restructure, renumber and rewrite in plain language the income tax law. The Bills before the House essentially provide a new framework for the tax law, into which future packages of rewritten law will be slotted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the whole, the new legislation has been well received by the tax and accounting professions, industry groups and academics. It became clear to the</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Committee during the inquiry that any improvements to the Bills would represent fine tuning rather than a major rethink. This stands as testimony to the efforts of the Bills' drafters and TLIP's extensive and comprehensive consultative and review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While there may be general support for the contents of the legislation, there is certainly not support for its scheduled commencement date. As the Bills stand, they are due to have effect from 1 July 1996, clearly making them retrospective in application. The Committee acknowledges arguments that, in practical terms, the 1996 Bills are not retrospective <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> because they are only rewriting existing law and not creating `new' law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, it is unacceptable to the Committee that taxation legislation of any form be retrospective. For this reason, the Committee has strongly recommended that the commencement date for the legislation be changed to the first of July after enactment. Some argued that the commencement date should simply be moved back a year&mdash;to 1 July 1997. The Committee disagrees, for there is a risk that the legislation will not be passed by that date and become retrospective again. The Committee's recommendation removes any possibility of this occurring. I might add that this recommendation is consistent with a similar recommendation made last year by the JCPA when it reviewed TLIP's progress up until then.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committer has made a number of other recommendations associated with the phase-in of the new Bills. The Committee has recommended that these and subsequent Bills by TLIP commence progressively. This will minimise the impact that the transfer to the new law will have on taxpayers. The Committee also believes that the Australian Taxation Office needs to make a public commitment to rewriting promptly Public Rulings that will be affected by the new legislation. Similarly, the ATO will need to ensure that any technical errors or unintended consequences are addressed speedily.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the Committee has recommended amendments to various clauses that reflect the concerns of tax professionals and industry groups. In fact, the process of amending the Bills before us still goes on. The Committee has recently been briefed on proposed government amendments to the Bills concerning company tracing provisions. However, there was not time to consider these in any detail. TLIP has also recently advised the Committee that it will be correcting several technical errors in the Bills. The Committee looks forward to seeing these changes made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the main objectives of the rewrite process is to reduce the long term cost of tax compliance. In the Committee's view, it is unlikely that compliance costs will come down significantly until such time as the underlying complexities of tax policy are addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a clear sense of frustration that unworkable sections of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 are being perpetuated in the 1996 Bill. Unfortunately, addressing these concerns is beyond TLIP's current mandate. In practice, however, TLIP's mandate could not have been expanded without the rewrite process becoming bogged down in policy debates. Having said that, the Committee acknowledges that there needs to be more substantial simplification of the law. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2976"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There remains, therefore, the continuing need to address the `small p' policy complexities being highlighted by TLIP. The success of the Committee's review process suggests that a parliamentary committee may be an appropriate forum to examine these issues. This is partly in response to a perception that the Treasury is unresponsive to concerns about these matters when they are raised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Therefore, the Committee has recommended that the Government fund a parliamentary committee to review the unworkably complex sections of tax law. This could be performed by the JCPA, a Joint Standing Revenue Committee or a Joint Select Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In fact, the Committee believes that tax simplification requires more than just a rewrite or a tidying up of policy complexities. What is ultimately required is a wide ranging review of tax policy at the Federal and state level. Only after such a review can compliance costs truly come down. The Committee urges the Government to consider this.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On a final note, the Committee would like to thank all those individuals and organisations which have provided written and oral evidence and advice to both the previous and current JCPA. Some witnesses have given evidence twice to assist the new Committee come up to speed on the issues. We also thank the various officials from TLIP who have briefed the JCPA on a number of occasions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On behalf of the Chairman, I would also like to thank my colleagues on the Committee who undertook the inquiry for the efforts they put in to it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the Committee believes that the efforts of all have generated a sensible and well informed debate. The result should be better legislation.</PARA>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On behalf of the Government I thank the Joint Committee of Public Accounts for its Report No. 345 and express our appreciation for the time and commitment which Committee members, and their <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> staff, have invested in its preparation. I include in that appreciation the time and interest invested by the many professional organisations and individual persons who made submissions to the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Joint Committee has taken a continuing interest in the rewriting of the income tax law. In November 1993, the Committee tabled its Report 326 An Assessment of Tax which recommended, among other things, the setting up of a broadly-based Task Force to rewrite the income tax law. The Tax Law Improvement Project was announced in the following month.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In November last year, the Committee tabled its Report 343 Tax Law Improvement: A Watching Brief in which it endorsed both the consultative way in which the project was proceeding and the intention to deliver the rewritten law progressively.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Income Tax Assessment Bill 1996 and 2 related Bills, which are the subject of the Committee's latest report, are the first major instalment of the rewrite of the income tax law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is pleased that the Committee endorses the Bills and reaffirms its support for the progressive delivery of the new law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rewriting the income tax law so that it can be more easily understood has important micro-economic benefits for all Australians. Clearer law is inherently fairer. The Government wants to secure these benefits as quickly as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government originally intended that the new law would apply for the current income year, as earlier versions of the Bills have been public since they were first introduced in November 1995. However, we recognise that the proroguing of Parliament in February created some uncertainty in the community about the reintroduction of the Bills and there has been unavoidable delay to the Parliament's consideration of them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I note that the Committee has recommended that the commencement of the Bills be postponed until the income year following Royal Assent. The Government believes that a definite start date needs to be conveyed to the community, so that it can plan with certainty.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In light of this, the Government has decided to defer the commencement of the new law until the 1997-98 income year (which for most taxpayers will start on 1 July 1997). This decision will give everyone more time to ensure a smooth transition to the new law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also recommends a small number of minor technical changes to the Bills, none of which involves any change in policy. I can inform the Senate that the Government accepts those recommendations and will make those changes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rewriting the law will also require the Commissioner of Taxation to update his public rulings to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2977"> reflect any changes in the new law. Taxpayers need certainty and are looking for an assurance that rulings obtained under the old law will not lapse simply because there has been a change to simpler language. I note with approval that the Committee endorses the Commissioner's proposal to negotiate, with the tax professions, a suitable process and timetable for rewriting affected rulings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a task as large as that embraced by this project there is always a danger that inadvertent errors may occur. I recognise the concern that any such errors be swiftly corrected. Again, I note with approval that the Committee endorses the process recently negotiated by the Commissioner and the tax professions for identifying and dealing with such errors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's other recommendations raise wider issues which will require closer examination by Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I am also taking this opportunity to announce a major improvement to the new law which will overcome a longstanding practical problem. The Government has decided to amend the Bills in the House of Representatives to introduce new, streamlined arrangements for allowing public listed companies to trace who beneficially owns their shares.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Companies that maintain continuity of their beneficial ownership may carry forward unused deductions, as tax losses. However, the existing processes for identifying ownership have been notoriously difficult and time consuming because of the varying ways in which shares can be held. In rewriting the losses provisions, the project members and corporate representatives have worked hard to resolve these difficulties. The new arrangements, which will improve certainty and bring about significant compliance cost savings, demonstrate the Government's commitment to supporting new ways to reduce excessive compliance cost burdens on business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments address longstanding concerns of the corporate sector. The amendments were referred to the Committee, but the Committee was not able to consider the proposals before completing its report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, Mr President, I repeat my thanks to the Committee for its report and look forward to a speedy passage of the Bills by the Senate when they arrive in this place.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are a more creative nation than this budget recognises or permits. We are a more united community than this budget will encourage. We are a nation of greater integrity than the shattered election pledges this budget contains&mdash;pledges that were given so forcefully and in such an unqualified manner by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) only a few months ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a budget of betrayal&mdash;not just a betrayal of election promises but a betrayal of the Australian promise itself, the promise of Australia working always towards a more fair, more just, more inclusive and united society. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2978"> The message of this budget is: don't be sick; don't be old; don't expect to go to university; if you are unemployed, too bad; and, if you are young and unemployed, forget it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the last election John Howard told Australians that they could trust him. He told Australians that, whatever budget numbers he inherited, all promises would be delivered. This budget breaches that trust. There is a long list of broken promises&mdash;promises made to mainstream Australia and made to battlers, promises made to students, promises made to the elderly, promises made to state and local governments. No contrived dribbling out of bad news for mainstream Australia and the battlers prior to the budget's presentation can hide that fact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new morality of this government is that there are core promises and non&hyphen;core promises, although no such distinction was made before the election. Core honesty; non&hyphen;core honesty. Would you take that from your kids? John Howard inherited an economy that he said `. . . was better than good'. Indeed he did. It was an economy with inflation that had been averaging two and a half per cent; an economy that had been growing by four per cent a year; an economy which created 700,000 jobs over the last three years; an economy which saw our exports, particularly those of manufactured goods, grow and diversify. He inherited an economy with a very small public sector by international standards and a budget outcome better than any in the industrialised world, bar a couple.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Compare all that with the economy we inherited back when we came into government. The unemployment and inflation rates were over 10 per cent and there was a $25 billion budget deficit in today's dollars. This government placed a dead hand on the economy when they took office. A core reality of this budget is that the dead hand is still there, so much so that Treasury officials observed in the budget papers that `. . . possible confidence effects, while significant, do not fully offset the direct short&hyphen;term effects of the measures resulting in a small net contractionary impact on activity in 1996-97'. That is Treasury&hyphen;speak for saying that this budget not <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> only does nothing for growth, but it will reduce it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead of undermining growth, the government should be promoting it. With more growth the budget could be restored to balance without the need for savage cuts to valuable public programs. Higher growths destroys the case for savage budget cuts. By keeping growth up, by aiming for sustainable growth at the four per cent we averaged during our last four years in office, we also bring unemployment down. Unemployment, not the budget, is the No. 1 problem facing Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Treasurer says that saving is our No. 1 problem. We have no argument that Australia has long had a saving problem; we did more to solve it, with the introduction of our national superannuation scheme, than any previous government. And now Mr Costello places a huge question mark over that achievement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have no argument that Australia's longer term economic interests are well served by restoring the budget to balance. That is why we, alone among post&hyphen;war Australian governments, delivered successive surpluses in the late 1980s. But we say that the best way to restore the budget to balance is through a moderate program of budget cuts over the whole life of this parliament which do not harm valuable public programs, which do not harm growth, and which provide hope rather than despair for the jobless.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Costello makes a virtue of the fact that this budget holds growth back so that in three years time, and with massive budget cuts, the surplus will be $1 billion. It suits the government to have low growth because low growth makes it appear as though bigger cuts are needed to restore the budget to balance. But, with average growth close to four per cent, it would be possible to achieve balance without savage budget cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the government's own admission, these cuts are not necessary to reduce the debt ratio: that would have happened anyway. And so far as reduction of the current account deficit is concerned, that is hardly going to change next year. These cuts are not being made for genuine reasons of economic necessity; they <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2979"> are being made to satisfy the Liberals' ideological obsession with reducing the role of government in Australian society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Significantly, the burdens in this budget are not equally shared. It is a wrong headed interpretation of this budget that it soaks the rich as well as the poor. Mr Costello has leaped to the challenge of the Commissioner of Taxation to collect $800 million of avoided tax by the wealthiest Australians with a slash of his feather duster&mdash;$100 million and a bit of a look. `Hopefully it will be collected voluntarily,' he said. `And have a bit of health insurance while you're at it,' he invites wealthy Australians, `or we'll give you a snip of a levy.' The burden is borne by the battlers, the job seekers, the students, the elderly and middle income Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He offers tax cuts. For a dual income family earning up to a total of $79,000, these tax cuts amount to $3.85 a week for each dependent child. But families want to educate their children. They want to use child care. They are worried about their kids getting an opportunity to work. They want to know that, if their elderly parents need a nursing home bed, they will be able to afford it. They use public hospitals. They carry the burden of increased taxes and charges when the states are slashed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A generation of women has grown up with successive Labor governments, with new expectations and hopes for the future: meaningful employment and ongoing careers&mdash;a totally different world from their mothers and grandmothers. The female labour force is over 50 per cent larger today than it was in 1983. The Prime Minister shows no sign of recognising this fact. But this fact is why successive Labor governments made available affordable, high quality child care. This recognised that many families do not have the means to allow one partner to leave the work force to care for their children, even if they would like to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the last election the Liberals were at pains to promise that this quality child care&mdash;affordable and available on an equal basis to all Australians&mdash;would remain. But what do we find in the budget? We find a range of mean&hyphen;spirited measures which will make child <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> care more expensive for all families. For those using community based care, it will be $14 per child per week more. And this won't be all: $500 million will be taken out of child care and it will be the parents who will have to make up the difference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Families contain people of all ages. What does this budget do for families of older Australians? We see a proposal which may force older Australians who need nursing home care, or their children, to find around $26,000 in entry fees. Nursing home residents also face a new fee of up to $34 per day, or $12,000 per year, depending on their income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Howard says that children should pay for their elderly parents to have a nursing home bed. This is yet another way this government is getting families to pay more. But it gets worse. Many older families, frail but still living in their own homes, are dependent on services such as Meals on Wheels, provided by the home and community care, HACC, program. These families are to be stung by greatly increased user fees. That is code for increased charges for Meals on Wheels and the like. The Prime Minister gives with one hand and takes away even more with the other, like a man that comes up to you in the street and says, `Here's $5, now give me $7.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the health area, Mr Howard promised to `retain Medicare in its entirety' and to provide a net increase in health funding. Instead, we have indirect cuts through reductions in the financial assistance grants to the states and direct cuts to hospital funding grants. The combined effect is a cut of around $800 million dollars over four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The nastiest, if not the largest, of the government's health cuts is the abolition of the Commonwealth dental health program. This program spends around $110 million a year and is exclusively directed at the provision of basic and emergency dental services to health card holders. The abolition of this program will reproduce the two&hyphen; to three&hyphen;year waiting lists which prompted the Commonwealth's intervention and which the program has substantially reduced. The budget speech contains the following explanation for the cuts: </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2980">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . as waiting times for public dental health services have now been reduced, funding for the Commonwealth dental health program will cease&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>As if your teeth can be fixed once, and that's the only time you need a dentist! Another of the coalition's major betrayals in health is big increases in the costs of prescription drugs. For a family with three children&mdash;and we all know how often they get sick at once&mdash;at $20 a script, that is $60 for a family for just one visit to the chemist. And the increased pharmaceutical charge for pensioners breaks Mr Howard's explicit promise to `maintain the real value of all pension benefits and other entitlements for low income earners'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Above all, there is the threat to bulk&hyphen;billing. The government says that it will maintain it, yet eliminates the CPI adjustment to doctors fees. Bulk&hyphen;billing is voluntary. Hundreds of doctors will stop bulk&hyphen;billing with this change. With another budget next May, you just have to wonder how many more changes and how many fee increases there are going to be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not equally share the burden of this budget. Those who live in regional Australia carry it disproportionately. Regional communities have already been hit by a big round of cuts. Many centres have lost their CES and their tax offices. Now they will lose their local Medicare offices and they will pay more for the services that continue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the recent election, the coalition asserted that regional communities were `Australia's forgotten people' and promised to `revitalise regional Australia'. Betrayal has been as swift as it is comprehensive. This government has abandoned regional Australia. In common with its approach to other  issues of national importance, it has abandoned its responsibilities to lead, to coordinate and to cooperate with the people of Australia's heartland. When it comes to regional Australia, this coalition has quickly become a government in exile. They are absentee landlords with a big city focus&mdash;a government of capital city lawyers from leafy suburbs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Roads are regional Australia's vital arteries, something that city dwellers often forget. Road funding through the national highway system has been slashed by $620 million. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Even with the Pacific Highway and the black spots programs, total road funding to the regions has been cut by $150 million over the next three years, and it will be hit with an additional $45 million cut the year after that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Infrastructure projects in centres such as Townsville, Moe and Newcastle, with a total value of $150 million, have been abandoned. This signals the end of the effective and community&hyphen;building cooperation between business, all levels of government, local communities and unions that had become the hallmark of regional development under Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Savage cuts to education spending and labour market programs will have a more than proportional impact in regional Australia. It is no wonder that the government's document <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rebuilding Regional Australia</EMPHASIS> makes no direct mention of education. Universities mean jobs and wages in regional areas. The impact of these education cuts on regional economies is huge. Yet this government intends to cut the funding for regional universities for every campus in every region in every state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Slashing labour market programs will have a punitive impact on both regional unemployed and the local government authorities and organisations that have benefited from the programs under Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ABC will not be able to insulate regional Australia from their massive cuts. National sporting events, news, current affairs, vital local weather and radio services for rural and regional Australians are threatened by Mr Howard's decision to cut $65 million from the nation's public broadcaster.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Fischer and his National Party have willingly collaborated with the Liberals in the betrayal of what they would have us believe is their constituency. These people are over&hyphen;represented in a ministry in which they lack the clout to stand up to ignorant Liberal colleagues and defend the interests of regional Australia. They deserve to share the retribution that awaits Liberals in regional seats at the next election.</PARA>
<PARA>EDUCATION </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposals for education deserve outright condemnation, not only because they cut <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2981"> off resources but also because they show the barrenness and prejudice in what passes for vision by this government. The government calls them `far&hyphen;sighted' and `equitable'. Those who are on the wrong end of them will call them vandalism. Labor set up and supported one of the most accessible higher education systems in the world. The government proposes to take so much funding out of universities that they will be harmed for years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Look at what this budget has done to young people and their parents, and their expectations. Labor brought higher education within the reach of all young people in Australia, wherever they lived, whatever their circumstances. This has gone. If you or your parents are well&hyphen;off, you are okay; if not, you are not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This vandalism goes on in school and vocational education. Funding for schools will be cut, including resources for capital and literacy programs. Assistance for students with disabilities will be stopped altogether. Vocational education will be cut, and the government has abandoned its agreement to fund growth in the TAFE system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Remember this: we have crossed a line here. Now that universities, schools and TAFE are just other sources of revenue, who can be confident that there is not more of this to come? It is on for young and old. Mr Howard has asked you to mortgage your kid's university education, and he has told you to mortgage your old age accommodation.</PARA>
<PARA>INDUSTRY</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has abdicated its responsibilities to Australian industry. Think of an industry where Australians have moved to the cutting edge; think of an industry that has made the hard yards in improved productivity and export competitiveness; think of key growth areas for small business&mdash;and you will be thinking of some sector, enterprise or activity that has been damaged in this budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Liberals fail to comprehend the fact that innovative export oriented industries are central to any strategy for future prosperity and jobs growth. Their treatment of the Australian Made campaign is a powerful signal of the extent to which they have lost the plot. The green and gold logo symbolised <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the emerging hope for the future of Australian industry, and the government has strangled it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget does not slash programs to end rorts; it hacks away at success stories and punishes innovators. Support for the manufacturing sector is to be cut by $336 million, or 60 per cent over the next three years. Exporters&mdash;whose efforts are crucial to our whole economic future&mdash;will lose $500 million over the same period. Industries critical to our export competitiveness and employment growth have been singled out&mdash;for example, by the removal of the ship building bounty and the abolition of the computer bounty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Research and development have been heavily set back by at least a decade. The broken promise that has seen the R&amp;D tax concession cut back will cost industry some $1.25 billion. When combined with the abolition of syndicated research, a total of $2.2 billion will be removed from research and development to be replaced by a paltry $340 million in grants. The result will see Australian researchers and Australian ideas move offshore, whilst a range of activities from medical research to information technology and electronics will stall for want of support in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Government support for exporters and industry has been crippled by cuts of $100 million from Austrade and of $30 million from Ausindustry. These all represent broken promises. They amount to dishonest government and, just as certainly, they amount to foolish government. Manufacturers, exporters and researchers have been ill&hyphen;served by this budget and, consequently, so have we all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Above all, this budget also betrays the jobless. This is a budget that will commit itself to no job targets between now and the end of the century. This budget ends the public labour exchange started by Ben Chifley. It shoves the unemployed into the hands of the inexperienced at the same time as it cuts nearly all of the programs that made the long-term unemployed job&hyphen;ready.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sheer ignorant prejudice has meant that the coalition has torn down the highly successful Working Nation employment and training programs&mdash;the very programs that were regularly praised by both major employer <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2982"> groups and individual Australians assisted back into the work force. And do not think that unemployment is not a mainstream issue. Three decades of technological change and industrial restructuring have meant that many have experienced the shock of redundancy previously only experienced by a few.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the election of the Howard government, redundancy has been legion in the public sector, in Telstra and in a wide range of industries. Australians expect their prime ministers to stand up for the weak and forgotten; to stand above treasurers and the desire to please the financial markets when necessity dictates; and to have a sense of community. The unemployed, the Aboriginals, the young and the aged have always needed it. For Mr Costello's budget, the Prime Minister stood aside.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> This is not a government for communities. It is a government for elite opinion leaders who do not get Meals on Wheels or use community child care; who can afford to pay for tertiary education, dental care, nursing home care; and who will not notice the burden of higher state taxes and charges. Australia is a cohesive community. We are an egalitarian community. Socially just communities are safe communities. Communities which deny opportunity are, in the end, denied security.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> This government attacks security in public sector employment, in the safety net when you are out of work and in effective access to public hospitals. This budget lays down the path to a two&hyphen;tier society. The Prime Minister is driven to division. All that is public or shared is cut and will be cut again. The message is that, whatever you cannot pay for, you do not deserve. It is an old style tory budget, scapegoating the battlers and having a dead hand on the national tiller.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will be up to business, Australian workers and our community to work their way back to the low inflationary growth they had and the opportunity we provided. It is a budget whose poisonous content will gradually seep out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> As a responsible opposition, we will subject its meanness to several tests. Where does a measure betray a promise? Where does it damage equity? Where does it fail to contri bute to national savings? The community demands no less. Many measures fail these tests. Many are locked away in the appropriations legislation immune in the end to defeat but not safe from rigorous criticism in our two houses of parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Others, however, are about revenue raising or go to the heart of community entitlement programs. The government's measures on the higher education charges, on nursing home contributions and charges and on pharmaceutical benefits for pensions and families&mdash;these, for example, will be rigorously opposed. We will oppose them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> This Prime Minister was elected promising Australians that they could be `comfortable and relaxed' and that he would make their lives more secure. Instead, he has hit them with massive changes, making their lives less secure. He promised a zone of comfort but he has delivered a nation more fearful than ever. Australians now face changes they do not need&mdash;changes that will hit the family budget and will divide communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The budget is a mere irritant for the rich, but a disaster for the disadvantaged and a matter of despair for the unemployed. It is the first chapter in the story of a new, unfair Australia. For all those who had hoped for a secure future for themselves and their kids, this is a budget of betrayal.</PARA></SPEECH>

The first is that it represents a calculated breach of faith with those Australians who elected the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, and the coalition into government. The second is that it is built on the backs of the unemployed. The third&mdash;and possibly most important theme&mdash;is that it heralds a significant shift from the public to the private. It signals a move away from the notion of community responsibility and from the idea that governments have a role to play in ensuring that all Australians&mdash;irrespective of their wealth&mdash;have access to a good standard of health care, to quality and affordable education and to the opportunity to find and keep a job.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt the political architecture surrounding this budget has been clever. It <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2983"> has delivered some positives&mdash;and the tactic of doling out the bad news first has clearly left the budget surrounded by a kind of aura of relief. But the political architecture of this budget goes back a lot further than the past few weeks. It is, after all, the culmination of a long tactical march which began this time last year. It started with John Howard's reply to last year's budget where he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The real fiscal outcome of the 1995 Budget is not the surplus of $770 million. The real fiscal outcome is actually a deficit of $8.2 billion.</PARA>
<PARA>However, by the time the election rolled around, John Howard was saying he had to accept the government's figures. He went on to make billions of dollars worth of election promises on that basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When asked by journalists during the campaign what he would do if the deficit was higher than the government's figures, John Howard's response was clear and unequivocal. At the National Press Club on 28 February, he was asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What if you win the election and then you discover . . . a serious budget deficit blowout. At what point and under what circumstances will you see it as necessary to cancel some of the many . . . promises you've made?</PARA>
<PARA>John Howard said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, the commitments that we've made in relation to reduced taxation and the other commitments we've made in our election policies, they will be delivered in full. I've been asked that question before and I repeat that answer.</PARA>
<PARA>He gave John Laws the same answer the day after the coalition's campaign launch. He said the same thing to Ray Martin on the first great debate. He was asked the question time and time again and time and time again he gave the same answer. Not only that, but he dressed it up in the language of trust. This is what John Howard had to say at the National Press Club three days before the election:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The final of the many challenges that I believe we face in this election is what I see in very broad terms as the sense of disillusionment and division within our community . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to see in a few years time a situation where there was a re&hyphen;establishment of trust between the people of this country and their elected leaders . . . <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>The Democrats share that concern about disillusionment and division. We share that desire to see a re&hyphen;establishment of trust between Australians and their leaders. We apply the same test to whomever is in government. Restoring that trust requires breaking out of the cynical and dishonest election ritual where the major parties outbid each other to make unaffordable promises, then miraculously stumble across the true budget deficit a few days after they take office and use this discovery to break promises they knew they were not going to keep in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We welcome the Charter of Budget Honesty, but the problem for John Howard is that many Australians who voted for him truly believed him when he said he was not playing this particular game. This budget shows that he was playing that game&mdash;$6 billion worth of promises kept; $12 billion worth of promises broken. That represents a massive breach of trust&mdash;something John Howard and the Treasurer, Mr Costello, are now trying to disguise by telling us they are only obliged to meet core commitments. Even that notion has been downgraded with John Howard yesterday on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> trying to define core commitments as promises that people remember.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Well, I believe people have got better memories than the coalition is giving them credit for. I think they will remember the coalition's promise to make unemployment a priority. I think they will remember the promises to maintain funding to universities, to keep Medicare in its entirety, to not cut the ABC and to maintain labour market programs. I think they will remember the promises on child care, on regional development and on not imposing new taxes or increasing existing ones.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John Howard is also overlooking one important other consideration and that is this: alongside the written promises given during the campaign, there was one largely unspoken understanding. That was that the coalition's two central promises&mdash;the family tax package and the private health insurance rebates&mdash;would not be funded by massive cuts to other programs. There was an understanding that these two big&hyphen;ticket promises would actually be worth something: that they would not be <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2984"> undermined by increased fees and charges for other services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had someone ring my office just this morning: the father of a young child whose wife works part time. He said he had voted for the coalition largely on the strength of its family tax package. He was angry because he had just worked out that, while he would get $4 a week out of that package, he was going to have to spend an extra $20 a week in child care. He said, `I will be about $16 a week worse off, and that's before I worry about having to pay extra for prescriptions.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A woman rang another of our offices yesterday: she had also voted for the coalition after years of voting Labor. Both she and her son had a chronic illness.

It means that there will be fewer people in jobs, less money to spend in the shops and lower economic growth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats believe the government has read the economy wrongly. We are entitled to disagree. The national accounts released yesterday show the story. In the June quarter, our economy scarcely grew at all. It grew by just one&hyphen;tenth of one per cent&mdash;the most sluggish growth outcome since 1992. Employment growth has been virtually non&hyphen;existent for 12 months. Business confidence is down. Consumers and families are worried. Yet, in this sluggish and tense environment, the coalition has consciously chosen to pull $7 billion out of the economy. This is a decision which will set Australia back, both economically and socially. The proof of that is in the Treasury's own forecasts on jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Treasury is forecasting a rise in employment of just 1.25 per cent this year. Given that our work force is growing by about two per cent a year, that means higher unemployment. In fact, it means unemployment this year will be 80,000 higher on average than last year. That is what the budget is built on. That is the choice you made&mdash;200 Australians a day, 1,500 Australians a week, 80,000 Australians a year losing their jobs. That is not sharing the pain; that is front&hyphen;end loading the pain to the vulnerable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to restate the Democrat position on deficit reduction. The Democrats support the need for deficit reduction. In fact, it is worth noting that, when the coalition were in opposition, they opposed deficit reduction measures worth more than $6.5 billion over the past three budgets. If we had followed their lead&mdash;which we did not&mdash;the budget deficit now would be nearly twice its current level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said many times, the Democrats accept that the budget deficit is far too high. We agree that Australia needs to put in place a credible deficit reduction strategy. We disagree with the government on the questions of how, by what amount and over what period of time the deficit should be reduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats argue that the coalition has failed to acknowledge two very fundamental <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2985"> points: firstly, that unemployment is driving a significant proportion of the budget deficit; and, secondly, that the way in which the deficit is reduced is as important as the act of reduction. We believe the government should focus on two medium&hyphen;term goals: to halve unemployment and to achieve a structural budget surplus within the next two to three years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Meeting the first goal would address the cyclical component of the budget deficit&mdash;that part which is due to excessive unemployment and which is about $4 billion.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XW4">Senator KERNOT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just listen, please. The second goal focuses on reducing the structural deficit. The Democrats believe a deficit reduction of about $4 billion to $5 billion over the next two to three years represents a credible and responsible strategy not just in economic terms but also in fiscal and social terms. If we go any further than that, we believe that we will start to slice into the social fabric. We also run the risk of the budget not only failing to deliver more jobs but becoming in itself a cause of unemployment&mdash;and that is the very big risk underlying the architecture of this budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats make no secret of our overall dissatisfaction with the budget. We make no secret of our dissatisfaction with Peter Costello's undisciplined and indiscriminate Scissorhands approach to deficit reduction&mdash;whirling through the expenditure side of the ledger, Scissorhands waving away, snipping and slashing at whatever wanders into his path. The result is a lopsided attempt at deficit reduction which well and truly earns the tag of `death by a thousand cuts'. The irony is that, as the details start to emerge, it may just be the government which ends up slowly bleeding to death.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even before this budget came down, this week's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin </EMPHASIS>Morgan Gallup poll reported that 52 per cent of Australians would not have voted for the coalition on election day if they had known about its real plans. They are certainly not going to be any happier once they realise the true impact of the budget on their lives and pockets. So, while the general <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> initial reaction might look favourable, the fact is that you cannot suppress bad news forever. People are going to be pretty angry when they figure out that the value of the family tax package has been almost totally undermined by cuts to education, to unemployment assistance, to child care and to public health services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can say today that the Democrats will support the family tax package. We recognise that Australians clearly expected John Howard to deliver on that. I do not know that they expected him to deliver on that at the expense of support to the unemployed, higher education or Medicare. They did expect to get more money in their pockets. However, we are not happy about the loose targeting of the rebate. We warn the government that, unless it tightens up the income test, it will be paying out the rebate to some very well&hyphen;off families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other big sweetener, the private health insurance rebate, is a somewhat different matter. Not only is it paid for by massive cuts in health care but it also may threaten Australia's ability to keep a reasonable rein on our overall health care costs. There are a number of problems with the private health insurance rebate&mdash;not the least of them being how it stacks up alongside the other changes to Medicare. I can say at this stage that we are favourably disposed towards an increase in the Medicare levy for higher income earners, irrespective of whether or not they have private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not favourably disposed towards the increase in the threshold for the medical expenses tax rebate. That increase simply penalises the growing number of Australians who are opting to self&hyphen;insure&mdash;who are, in the coalition's own terms, already being `self&hyphen;reliant'. It would be irresponsible of the Democrats to respond to these very significant changes in our health care system without consulting widely and without working carefully through the issues. We will announce our position on these changes within the next fortnight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the Democrats will vote against increases in payments for prescriptions under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme&mdash;as we did on several occasions under the previous <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2986"> Labor government. We will maintain our long&hyphen;held opposition to user&hyphen;pays education. We will oppose the cuts in operating subsidies to universities and we will vote against the changes to HECS and Austudy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are unhappy about the fact that the abolition of the new schools policy seems to have given the government the excuse to take $128 million out of a chronically underfunded state school system. This is one of those offsets which typify the `public to private' flavour of this budget. It will also result in parents of children in the state school system paying more in fees and charges for what should be basic educational entitlements. And that is something else which is going to cut into the family tax rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are opposed to funding cuts to the ABC and to ATSIC. We know they have been on the coalition's enemy list for years and years and now it is payback time. However, we know that these cuts will form part of the roughly $3 billion worth of measures which are parcelled up in the appropriation bills. The Democrats make no apologies for our ongoing commitment not to block supply. We do not believe in denying the government&mdash;and, through it, the public sector&mdash;the money it needs to run the country. This nation still bears the scars of the events of 1975&mdash;and they are events which should never be repeated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But our pledge not to block supply does not stop us from requesting amendments to the appropriation bills. This is a tactic we intend to use, with the clear and specific aim of putting pressure on government backbenchers in marginal seats to stand up and be counted on the most damaging, mean and nasty aspects of this budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On a positive note, we welcome some of the measures for small business, in particular the long overdue reduction in the provisional tax uplift factor and the exemption from capital gains when the proceeds of the sale of a small business are rolled over into another business. But, yet again, the value of these measures will be undermined by massive cuts to research and development, to export assistance, to the DIFF scheme and to regional <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> infrastructure&mdash;all programs which help create jobs.</PARA>

<STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(8.21 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These days Treasury rules, okay. Treasury rules on direction by the money market, and by that read money speculators of Europe and America. And isn't it amazing how many commentators are ticking the budget on the basis of what the speculators are saying. This is the basis of approval on how we run not just our economic policies but also our social and environment policies. In fact, in relation to every value policy, we look to see whether we get a tick by the money speculators of Europe and America.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real game with budgets is often very diffuse. In fact, around 70 per cent of appropriations are currently automatic appropriations, so many of the decisions that are taken in relation to spending are never in any way in the budget appropriation bills. While budget decisions are important and have real impacts on real people, a lot of the activity at budget time is theatre&mdash;a chance to create images. The budget books, I have noticed, are often written with the theatre of the period in mind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One thing to note is that there are a lot of rubbery figures, especially in terms of forward projections. There are large variations&mdash;a billion up or down as a result of a variation in a single percentage point in prices. Treasurers like to dress up their budgets using these and a few other devices. One device we have noticed in the past is that the presentation of actual figures of the previous year allowed an appearance of a substantial increase in funding where the actuality was that the prior year's budget was not entirely spent. In some environmental areas, we noted in the past that a budget decrease appeared and was announced as an increase.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another little trick of Treasury is to project declining funding into the future. Again, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> environment budgets&mdash;in paragraph 7.4, `environmental protection', or in paragraph 8.4, `national estate and parks', or in paragraph 10.7, `natural resources development and management'&mdash;have for the last several years shown an increase in the current year budget with rapid decline in the future. The next year the same pattern would follow. Basically the declining forward projections allowed the forward outlays to be lower, bringing future budgets well back into the black, while the previous decline allowed a small increase to look like a substantial new initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A very big example of this kind of ruse applied to the labour market programs of the previous government in 1993 which we identified in that year as a hole in the budget that would need to be filled. It simply was not realistic, at a time of high unemployment, to axe your entire labour market programs&mdash;and we said so, but we were the only ones saying so. Sure enough, 1994 included the Working Nation plan. The thing to recognise is that much of this was the simple replacement of programs that had fallen off the budget and which had been called a deficit reduction plan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This year we again see a huge decline in labour market programs at a time when employment prospects are not looking good. It is one thing when this is just rubbery figures. It is another thing entirely when a government is actually content to allow programs and whole portfolio areas to fall into a pit&mdash;a black hole, which in physics is something that sucks everything into it and emits no light.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our worry is that this government intends to stick to its forward estimates. In previous years when the forward estimates went down there was generally an increase in the environment and in other areas in some particular programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has presided over a real decline in environmental funding this year. Not only has environmental funding declined this year, but we are afraid that the government really intends to cut&mdash;in paragraph 10.7&mdash;natural resource management by about half; in the next few years it really intends to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2988"> cut&mdash;in paragraph 8.4&mdash;national estates and parks by a third; and it really intends to cut&mdash;in paragraph 7.4&mdash;environmental protection by 55 per cent. This is what it says in the budget papers. I am afraid in this case that it is not just a ruse to make the forward estimates look better; I am afraid the government really means to devastate the environment budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to note a few things in relation to environment spending. The government say in the budget papers on page 3&hyphen;125 that they will eliminate the wet tropics tree planting scheme, saving over $5 million, and cut over $24 million in each of the next three years from DEST. On page 3&hyphen;131 you will notice that they will eliminate the off&hyphen;reserve nature conservation and the ecologically sustainable natural resource management program, savings of between $11 million and $17 million per year in this year and each forward year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They will eliminate initiatives to establish a world&hyphen;class, adequate and representative system of parks and reserves, a saving of between $16 million and $32 million per year in this year and each forward year. They will eliminate green volunteers, an Australian nature conservation volunteer program. On page 3&hyphen;142, it says that they will eliminate the national landcare program expansion, saving between $43 million and $59 million per year in this year and each forward year. They will eliminate the Murray-Darling Basin initiative, saving between $17 million and $34 million per year in this year and each forward year. They will even claw back $7 million from the drought recovery management facility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also point out from page 35 of the government's Investing in our Natural Heritage document that they plan to cut environment portfolio outlays by over half in the next four years. Yes, it says that there may be other spending if the Senate agrees to sell Telstra; but, bottom line, their commitment to the environment is to halve its funding unless the Senate buckles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is nothing here that says what the level of annual funding will be. The total funding is apparently slightly over $1 billion, but there is no indication over what period this will be distributed. On page 5 of the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Investing in our Natural Heritage document, it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The $1 billion received from the one third sale of Telstra will be supplemented both by interest earned and from consolidated revenue, so that overall, an additional $1.149 billion will be spent . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The plain English reading of this is that, from Telstra and interest from the trust and consolidated revenue, this is all the money you will give to the environment. I am pleased to see that Senator Kernot has also done the figures and has established the same reality&mdash;that is, even if Telstra is sold, no more money will be available on a per annum average basis than is available this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that when you look at the spending program in that Telstra package you see most of it is not even environmental spending. It is not even to be managed by the environment; it is to be managed by primary industry. It is a total ruse. The whole thing from beginning to end is a ruse.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of general social wellbeing, this is a disaster budget as well. For the aged the government will allow those of retirement age to keep contributing to superannuation and will allow them to get a rebate for contributions to the superannuation funds of an unemployed spouse. Given that few of the working poor can afford voluntary superannuation contributions, the idea that they would voluntarily contribute to a spouse is hard to see. The rich, however, may have a non-working spouse to contribute to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bank retirement savings accounts are the coalition's way of giving banks more economic power. On the other hand, the government is increasing the cost of prescriptions, increasing the cost of aged care, introducing fees for community care and eliminating the Commonwealth dental program. It will also eliminate the means test exemption for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2989"> superannuation for older people between the ages of 55 and 65.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For families there is a worsening situation for education, increased health costs and various changes to tertiary education designed to push adult students into dependency on their parents. Perhaps that means they should be staying home and somehow or other the coalition thinks they can point their finger at them and say, `If they were good and if they had a good family, they would all be at home until they were 26.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there are the general changes to industrial relations and the fact that we are being pushed, perhaps, into the recession we did not have to have. Competition policy changes will also mean that a new range of services will become user pays or may increase in cost. What we have seen is the excuse of the budget to move from government to private providers, whether or not it leads to better outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a huge number of problems, for example, in relation to case management. Not a lot of private providers actually want to provide case management. There is not a lot of profit in it and, if you are going to promise more profit, that does not mean that it is going into the public sector. Quite frankly, the way to gain more profit is to cream off the employable and get the others off the books. That is going to be made a little easier by the coalition. It is going to be made easier because you tighten up the rules, make it harder for people to find enough money to pay their rent, take money from them if they happen to share a house with another person to survive; and then, if you find them breaking the rules, throw them off the system. That should save a lot of money and that should allow private providers of case management to make a bit more profit&mdash;throwing people off the books will make it more profitable for them to operate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> For young people, for whom unemployment is running at over 20 per cent, the government has made tertiary education much more expensive, has undercut Austudy and, as I mentioned, with the decrease in rent assistance, has hit those who are single and trying to reduce costs by sharing rent. The govern ment plans to make $40 million on this. In the meantime, it is guaranteeing that universities will increase their non&hyphen;HECS charges for course materials and, by so doing, reducing funding to universities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to give a little summary of the winners and losers in education&mdash;a bit of an education scoresheet. Who gets the increases? There will be increased capital funding for private schools: they get $5 million extra up to $10 million per year. There is an increase to the apprentice and trainee program of $5 million to $8 million per year, an increase of $4.8 million per year in aid to isolated children and increases to English as a second language programs of $4.4 million per year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are the cuts? There will be overall cuts in total education in real terms of 0.1 per cent this year, 3.6 per cent next year and two per cent in the following year. And these cuts are greater on a per capita basis. Overall cuts in higher education in real terms will be two per cent this year, 10 per cent next year and seven per cent in the following year. And these cuts are greater on a per capita basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The overall cuts in funding for government primary and secondary schools in real terms are: 0.2 per cent this year, 2.4 per cent next year, 2.4 per cent the following year and 2.8 per cent in 1999&hyphen;2000. These cuts are also greater on a per capita basis. Reducing discretionary funds for universities represents a cut of $43 million per year. Cuts to higher education operating grants are $22.4 million, rising to $266 million, and targeting of Austudy will cut $63 million per year. Raising the age of independence for Austudy is a cut of $28 million, rising to $78 million, and reducing maximum Austudy rent assistance to students in shared houses is a cut of $0.4 million. I should mention that in Austudy we heard last year about student rent related poverty. I think that fell on deaf ears, so poverty will be the in thing for people who are game enough to go into tertiary education. I think fewer of our able students will do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other cuts include: HECS increases&mdash;$22.6 million, rising to $123.5 million; earlier HECS repayments&mdash;$230 million to $318 million; unspecified savings&mdash;$14 million, increasing to $56 million; reducing cash <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2990"> balances of statutory authorities&mdash;$15 million; eliminating case management of homeless secondary students on Austudy and Abstudy&mdash;$3.8 million; cutting homeless secondary students on Austudy and Abstudy schooling incidentals allowance&mdash;$2.8 million per year; eliminating Australian youthnet&mdash;$0.3 million per year; reducing vocational and training grants to states&mdash;between $10 million and $24 million in various years; cutting ANTA operating costs by 25 per cent&mdash;$3.6 million per year; cutting back indexing TAFE&mdash;$5.3 million, rising to $41.4 million; cutting funding for schools in external territories&mdash;$1 million per year; cutting migrant places for people under humanitarian programs on the ESL program&mdash;$1 million to $7 million; reduction in ESL for migrants&mdash;$5.5 million to $14.6 million; and the two&hyphen;year waiting period for migrants before Austudy&mdash;$12.5 million per year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who are the winners? Well, almost no&hyphen;one. There are slight benefits and no pain for those with children in private schools. The losers? The nation is the loser through reduction in education and industry will lose through reduction in the skilled work force. But industry will put the pressure on the government and the government will say, `Okay, let us get in some skilled migrants. Let us adjust the supply curve of the labour market because we do not want industry to have to pay too much for skilled workers.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who else loses? The economy loses through a reduction in people who might provide the basis for a clever country. Young people lose through a reduction in quality of education and vastly increased costs of tertiary education at a time when this is a requirement for a decent job. Families who assist their children at school will lose as a result of increased costs and a decreased ability of university aged children to be independent. The vulnerable lose: migrants and teenage secondary school students who are homeless.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was just one example, one program. I would urge those people who read the headlines and said, `What a fair budget. They've cut their mates but they've been fair' to look at the details of what has actually been provided. To show exactly where the heart <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and mind of the government is: there is a measure to take away the book allowance from homeless teenagers trying to stay in high school. This is mean, ugly and nasty. It is a vicious attack on those least able to defend themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thought and thought about these kinds of measures, about why there has been certain targeting, and I have decided that it was a very large case of opportunism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A large number of people in our society, many of whom were blue&hyphen;collar workers, were, admittedly, feeling betrayed. They did not know what exactly was happening to them to change their lives&mdash;why they were feeling less certain; why they were on shorter contracts; why they were having to work harder for the same or lower salaries; why they suddenly found they were either out of work or working fewer paid hours; why they suddenly found themselves on split shifts in some states; or why they suddenly had to get two incomes just to survive. Those people were feeling betrayed yet they were being told by the previous government, `You've never had it so good.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was not explained that all of the benefits that were supposed to come from this great new internationalism in all these new markets was not actually happening. It was not explained that we had now lost a lot of our manufacturing industry and a lot of people had lost their jobs. It was not explained that we had made a big error. It was not explained that the new internationalism meant that Australian industries were no longer Australian industries and that there was almost a free rein on speculative investment whereby people could come in and do a bit of asset stripping and people would lose their jobs and production could go overseas. It was not explained that this was part of the big error we had made in accepting the new internationalism through the Uruguay Round of GATT.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But because both parties agreed to that error, and there was almost no debate, all those people in blue&hyphen;collar jobs in Australia felt betrayed and did not know who to blame. Guess what? They listened to John Laws, Alan Jones and those sorts of people saying, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2991"> `Ah, I've got a good idea. Let's blame the unemployed, young people, Aborigines, migrants and everybody else except those people who helped to make the decisions which changed people's lives so drastically in the last few years so it will now be a double whammy.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new government picked up that little window of opportunism and said, `Let's use this budget and cash in on the scapegoating that results from communities feeling disenchanted, disenfranchised and betrayed. And let's try to direct that against those people that the racists in our community direct people to hate.' That is exactly what this budget is about&mdash;directing the anger of the community away from the decision&hyphen;makers who have changed people's lives to the people who can least fight for themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can understand the disillusion amongst blue&hyphen;collar workers. But they were not told what was happening to them through the new internationalism, world's best practice and the fight to the bottom. They did not have explained to them the implications of the wide&hyphen;ranging impacts of competition policy which will continue for years to come when values go out the window in exchange for the short&hyphen;term dollar and making profits for some corporations and companies in our society at the expense of values and outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other people targeted in this budget include indigenous people and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander programs are also being cut. Somebody must have seen a poll indicating that attacking indigenous people would be less electorally damaging than attacking middle&hyphen;class Australians&mdash;and, of course, the poor whom the government has targeted for its wonderful unaccounted savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, there is the increased activity test on the jobsearch allowance and newstart. Somehow this will net the government up to $116 million, and it must be pretty heavily increased to cut all those people off. The government will simply save up to $127 million on some ATSIC programs and, I believe, up to $400 million on others altogether. How? What will be the human outcomes? What on earth do you expect to save from that level of human suffering?</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What was the goal of this budget? To reduce the deficit? Is this what governments should take as their sole aim for budgets? I do not believe so because somehow or other if you say you are going to reduce the deficit, it is what Paul Keating used to call `getting a good set of numbers'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Somehow there must be a goal for benefiting the community. What were the long&hyphen;term goals for benefiting the community? Before the election the government said it would increase employment opportunities for young people. Frankly, this budget will do the exact opposite. So what was the goal of this budget if it was simply to reduce the deficit? Affordable tax cuts have caused much of the deficit. Basically, when you cut tax and you cannot afford to do so, you get into a deficit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead of looking at the tax system and wondering how you can increase the revenue and make the tax system more fair again, the only goal of this budget is cutting programs and expenditure and cutting from the most vulnerable in our society. There was less than $1 billion worth of changes to revenue and the rest came from cutting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can this be justified only by cutting? A number of economists of highstanding in Australia do not believe so. But what are the choices? If we do not have enough money in the government coffers for the programs we need to provide in a decent, fair society then we look, amongst other things, at revenue measures. We look at whether our tax system is fair and, if not, how we can increase that fairness. We look at revenue measures which will redress the growing gap between rich and poor which the coalition mentioned again and again during the last parliament. That is what the Greens (WA) will be working towards&mdash;not letting this government off the hook; not letting them pretend in any way, shape or form that they have given any gift whatsoever to this nation by way of this budget. We will not let them forget that there are options they chose not to take, that they used this budget as a ruse and that we do not now or ever accept they should make the sole goal of their budget pleasing the money speculators of this world. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, I will deal with what for some people is the good news; that is, the retirement of Alan Platt. The President paid tribute to Alan yesterday morning here in the chamber and, in paying tribute to his service to the Senate and the parliament, she mentioned that Alan had been awarded the prestigious meritorious service medallion and certificate from the Senate. I would have thought that the work that Alan has done for this chamber deserved at least a trip to Government House.

I join with the President and many others who have paid tribute to him and wish him and his family all the very best in his retirement. This is the last night that he will serve the Senate while it is sitting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> But he is not alone in departing this place. From the list of the scores of attendants who service us and this chamber, Natalie Campbell, an attendant, will also be leaving the services of the Senate next Monday as will Victor Amsteins, together with Terry Widdi combe, Anna Machado and Brian Agnew&mdash;six people who have with dedication, cheerfulness and faithfulness served us and who will depart from their permanent duties as attendants who service this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is sad because I think each and every senator would know each of the individuals who will not be around when we return in September. We will miss them but I guess we won't know we are missing most of them until we don't see them around any more. These are six human beings, six individuals, out of the tens of thousands of people in the Public Service of this country who will no longer be in jobs because of the actions of the current government in Canberra, many as a direct result of decisions announced in this place and the other place on Tuesday night and as a result of some of the earlier announcements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is all very fine to talk about a thousand going from that department and another thousand from a different department, and adding up the numbers and saying, `Isn't it dreadful; it's 15,000, now it's 20,000 or 30,000.' Quite often, even some of us on this side of the chamber forget that the thousands of people we are talking about are human beings, workers, people who have families who are dependent on the income that is gained from the services rendered in doing the job for us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certain decisions have been made in the Department of the Senate that have led to the retirement of Alan Platt and his colleagues. We wish Alan well in retirement. He is probably going on to better things but for lots of others of those thousands of people there will be no enjoyment. For the others sitting out there in the Public Service now who don't know whether that fateful telephone call will come tomorrow we should have some empathy&mdash;we, above all, who as politicians generally do not have certainty in our occupations and our lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2993"> It should be a joyous occasion for Alan. He certainly will be missed. I hope the local politicians, not least the President of the Senate and also my colleague who is in the chamber and who will be speaking a little later, will take the hint in my opening re marks about the trip to Government House. I mean it sincerely because I am very firmly of the opinion that many others have made the trip to Government House to receive awards, having contributed a lot less than Alan Platt and his colleagues have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My colleague Senator Cooney last night on the adjournment also mentioned Alan and, by way of diversion, mentioned it was his daughter's birthday yesterday. We all joined in wishing Megan a happy birthday as another Leo. Not to be outdone, I have to announce to the chamber and the world that it is my stepdaughter's birthday. Kate Watkins is also a Leo and she is celebrating her birthday. She, in turn, is now very embarrassed as was Megan Cooney last evening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final thing I wanted to comment on&mdash;I want to hold to my word about not delaying the Senate too long&mdash;is the demonstration that occurred outside this place on Monday. A few people got out of control and, in turn, caused the very good behaviour of the vast majority of the people in attendance at the demonstration to be brought into some degree of disrepute. Everybody I have heard has condemned the behaviour of the few individuals who caused the very violent scenes outside and immediately inside the front entrance of the building. They are condemned unequivocally.</PARA>

I would hope that when an inquiry is conducted it will reveal the reasons, the causes and the names of the persons who gave the orders to block the access of those people who approached the body of the demonstration from Civic. They came up the roadway from Civic and tried to enter the demonstration and were blocked by a line of policemen. I witnessed that personally. I was in the vicinity when it happened.

<STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(8.55 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad that Senator McKiernan is here tonight to hear what I have to say because it is largely in reply to what he said last night. I will just summarise the allegations made by Senator McKiernan, as I recall them. He said that the current royal commission in Western Australia, which is looking into the Wanneroo matter, was biased, that it was aggressively discrediting whistleblowers&mdash;namely, Mr David King&mdash;that the counsel assisting the royal commission was engaging in an attack on the ministry of justice, and that the royal commission was artificially interpreting evidence before it. I will deal with those allegations in turn.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Suffice to say, Senator McKiernan's comments were reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> today. The heading was entitled `Commission under attack'. At the outset, Narelle  Johnson, counsel assisting the royal commission, was reported as not making any comment. Of course, that was entirely appropriate for her because the royal commission is continuing and any comment from her, as well as from the commission, would be entirely inappropriate. Therefore, I think the record needs to be clarified on that point. Where the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> reports that there was no comment forthcoming from the commission or Ms Johnson, it must be understood that the only <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2994"> thing they could do was to remain silent. It cannot be interpreted in any way that the commission or Ms Johnson agreed with anything that Senator McKiernan said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me go to the allegation made that the commission was aggressively discrediting whistleblowers&mdash;namely, Mr King. Narelle Johnson, counsel assisting, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">King was ultimately forced to concede that he had no evidence to support the allegation he had made against Mr and Mrs Edwardes.</PARA>
<PARA>That was based on the facts as presented to the royal commission. King himself had made the concession. There was no artificial interpretation of the evidence by Ms Johnson. Ms Johnson is a lawyer of experience and great reputation. She is not the sort of person, I would submit to the Senate, who is prone to making artificial interpretations of evidence. Furthermore, Senator McKiernan stated that Ms Johnson went on to attack the intelligence unit of the ministry of justice. This is not true. What Ms Johnson said before the royal commission was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the intelligence unit was not supposed to gather information in relation to the wider ministry. Its role was limited to prison-related activities and that must clearly be the case. The concept of intelligence gathering units within the public service departments as a general proposition must be anathema to any sensible member of the community. The potential for abuse is manifest.</PARA>
<PARA>Ms Johnson was saying that the unit concerned had obviously exceeded its charter. I would take her point that to have such intelligence gathering units within a department could well be the subject for potential abuse. This does not have the ramifications for the fight against crime and corruption that Senator McKiernan says it has. Really, the investigation of crime and corruption is not up to some unit in a department of the public service; it is up to the police. Indeed, the police force in Western Australia has been investigating this matter surrounding events in Wanneroo competently, so much so that people have now been gaoled and further charges have been laid against others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I am saying to the Senate is that a properly constituted royal commission is fulfilling its duties to the state of Western Australia and the people of that state and that, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> furthermore, the law is taking its course. There are those in Western Australia who simply are not happy with the interim report of the royal commission which cleared Cheryl Edwardes, the Minister for Family Services, and her husband of any wrongdoing whatsoever. In fact, Norm Marlborough told the Western Australian parliament on 4 August 1996:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am one of the majority who wants to see her&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Mrs Edwardes&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">banished. I want to see her out of Parliament, and I will. That will happen.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>Obviously, people of that sort are not happy with the result, so they are now attacking the people who are working in the royal commission. We saw a similar attack in relation to the royal commission dealing with Carmen Lawrence. If you don't like the decision, you attack the integrity of the royal commission and the commissioner involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The record has to be set straight. Ms Johnson is not at liberty to say anything at this stage, nor is the royal commissioner, Mr Davis. I defend the way in which that royal commission is being conducted and the integrity of the people involved in that. I say to the Labor Party in Western Australia that, if it intends winning the next state election, it should stick to arguing policies and not attack members of the judiciary or the police force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, the true political motive in this whole matter is revealed when one looks at Senator McKiernan's attempts to link the Howard government with playing a role in any alleged cover up of corruption in Western Australia. I say to Senator McKiernan: that really is drawing a very long bow indeed. Such a flimsy allegation will be seen for what it is and rejected out of hand by the people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thoroughly condemn the corruption which has been found to exist in certain aspects of this matter pertaining to Wanneroo. However, I fully support the due process of the law, which no&hyphen;one is able to show is not taking place in that state.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak briefly on the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2995"> comprehensive test ban treaty and its recent developments. For some time India has been reticent to sign the comprehensive test ban treaty along with the group of 21 developing nations. India's position has been the most publicised because they are in a problematic position due to being one of the nuclear weapons states, alongside Pakistan and Israel, who have not acceded to the non-proliferation treaty. However, their position should not detract from their message, theirs or that of the group of 21 nations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The concerns of these 22 nations are that the CTBT is a hollow agreement without a timetable for disarmament. On top of this, the CTBT has been designed almost to fail, needing signatures of 44 named countries including Pakistan, Israel and India before it even enters into force. The strategy is akin to allowing the big players to force the little players into an agreement without making any concessions whatsoever themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The group of five acknowledged nuclear nations&mdash;China, the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Russia&mdash;forced the non-proliferation treaty through without a timetable for disarmament and are now finding it even more difficult with the CTBT because the non&hyphen;nuclear nations are becoming more resistant. The nuclear club deny that in fact it is their possession of the largest nuclear arsenals in the world that affects continuing nuclear acquisition within the group of five and outside it amongst the so-called nuclear threshold states. For any real cessation of the nuclear arms race, of which nuclear testing is a part, a timetable for disarmament is critical.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The CTBT is problematic in itself and will only be effective with a timetable for disarmament. This is because, even with a zero threshold, states will continue testing via computer simulated testing. Voluntary disarmament that has largely occurred between the United States and Russia with by far the largest arsenals has been tokenistic and insignificant. The oldest and less advanced warheads are being dismantled while newer, more powerful and sophisticated weapons are being developed. Testing will occur, albeit invisible to international monitoring and inspection agencies, at a fast pace while a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> timetable for disarmament is stopped from forcing a pause in the nuclear arms race.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia can now play a role in bringing this timetable for disarmament to the fore in the comprehensive test ban treaty negotiations. Apparently, the group of five nuclear nations have today asked Australia to put the CTBT before the United Nations General Assembly in order to bypass the Indian veto in the disarmament committee in Geneva. This is because the P5 nations apparently consider Australia to be the best placed country to sponsor the treaty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because the P5 have been largely responsible for the fact that the current entry into force provision of the treaty is delayed, therefore crippling the treaty, Australia should use its position to strengthen the treaty preamble and the entry into force provision. The way to do this is that Australia should take action to impose preferably a timetable for disarmament or, as the Canberra Commission has called for, a timetable for negotiations for disarmament&mdash;perhaps just as a first step. Australia must be proactive on this issue to focus on a better outcome for all, rather than the nuclear weapons states that our policies usually pander to. I believe we are still waiting for a response from the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) to the Canberra Commission. I hope that there is some recognition of what is currently happening in relation to international treaties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On behalf of my staff and on my own behalf, I give my personal thanks to Alan Platt for all his assistance over the years that I have been a senator. My staff especially asked me to thank Alan for all the help that he has given them over the time that they have been working with me. We are very grateful for the work he has put in and wish him a very happy retirement.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<STATE> (Australian Capital Territory)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(9.07 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today is the last opportunity to put on the public record our appreciation of those people who have spent their lives in the service of the public. The CPSU estimates that about twenty&hyphen;seven and a half thousand jobs will go just through <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2996"> administrative cuts to date, and thousands more as a result of the budget handed down by this government two days ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ACT, the people that I represent, will bear a significant proportion of these job losses, but many others around Australia will bear the burden as well. With respect to the administrative cuts, many of those people are taking up the offer of redundancy and this week represents their last week of employment in the Public Service. On behalf of Labor, I extend our gratitude to each and every person who has given of themselves to the Commonwealth Public Service. Work in the public sector is incredibly diverse. Whether you are a painter, a landscaper or an administrative officer, it is crucial that each and every contribution is recognised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what are the options for these people who are taking redundancy packages? If we look at it in the context of this budget, things are not very rosy at all. Contemplating small business? This government has actively denied this country at least half a percentage point of growth and that is not good business in anybody's language. Contemplating retirement? Feel sure that there will be a user&hyphen;pays principle for home and community care services, and an increase in nursing home fees to boot. Looking for other work? The problem with living in Canberra at the moment is that the impact of the public sector cuts on our local economy goes far beyond just that of the public sector; it eats into the private sector and into all of the support services that exist in our town. What about retraining? Sorry, all the labour market programs have gone. What about returning to higher education; perhaps a change in career? Just in case that seemed like an option, there will be fewer places, higher fees and far less opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only other option is to contemplate leaving this place. Anybody who has grown up here or lived here will know that is something that is not a preferred option. Canberra is a beautiful city and the people who live here are very proud of it. Being forced to leave this city will be too high a price for many, but, faced with the option of the poverty line, perhaps it will just be enough to force these people out of town. I am talking <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> about people I know. They are people with children, with parents, and many of their families have been here for a number of generations. My colleague Senator McKiernan has already spoken this evening about the six attendants who are faced with a situation similar to the one I am describing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is quite obviously anti&hyphen;public sector. It has an ideology that does not go along with a public sector that provides genuine services. It seems to think that Canberra, in particular, is a place that can withstand a bit of harsh treatment and almost deserves a bit of a beating. Canberra does not seem to fit with this government's ideological picture of a market driven, dry, harsh world. For many, as I said, this week is their last week of employment with the Commonwealth public sector and all of these people need some hope, some future. They deserve it. Their work has contributed to the quality of all Australians' lives and, indeed, to the lives of many less fortunate overseas. I am referring to the work of people in AusAID and other agencies who have provided much support and assistance to people right around the world. Because of this government, their path will be so much more difficult and they know it. We saw how much they know it when they demonstrated here on Monday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish these people and their families all the best in their future endeavours. Please be assured that many Australians not only recognise your contributions but also appreciate them. They see the need for your work. A <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2997"> sincere thankyou to you all for your dedicated service.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The information in respect of migrants receiving social security benefits during the past ten years, referred to in the honourable Senator's question, is not readily available. To collect and assemble it would be a major task and I am not <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2998"> prepared to authorise the expenditure of money and effort involved in assembling such information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the period from 1 October 1993 to 1 October 1995, 52,997 migrants were granted a social security allowance or benefit (that is, Job Search Allowance, Newstart Allowance, Sickness Allowance, Widow Allowance, Partner Allowance, Youth Training Allowance or Special Benefit) within their first two years of permanent residence in Australia. This data is based on grants of payment, and therefore includes people who received only one payment, as well as longer&hyphen;term beneficiaries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The average length of time for which a person received a benefit is measured differently, depending on whether the person is still receiving a payment or not. Of the 52,997 migrants described in (1) above, a total of 18,138 were receiving an allowance or benefit at May 1996, while the balance of 34,859 were no longer receiving an allowance or benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of those who were still in receipt of an allowance or benefit at May 1996, the average duration on payment was 365 days. Of those who were no longer receiving an allowance or benefit at May 1996, the average duration on payment was 171 days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Note that a break of more than 13 weeks in the continuity of a payment results in the measurement of payment duration being started again from zero when a person reclaims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The information in respect of financial outlays in social security benefits to migrants, referred to in the honourable Senator's question, is not readily available. To collect and assemble it would be a major task and I am not prepared to authorise the expenditure of money and effort involved in assembling such information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) Of the 52,997 migrants described in (1), above, 17,131 had been permanent residents of Australia for two or more years at May 1996. Of those, 4,626 were receiving an allowance or benefit at May 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) Of the 52,997 migrants in the 1993&hyphen;1995 sample, 18,138 were still receiving an allowance or benefit at May 1996 (the most recent data available). As described in (4), above, 4,626 of these had been permanent residents of Australia for two or more years at that time. A total of 13,512 of the migrants in the sample were receiving an allowance <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> or benefit at May 1996, but had been permanent residents of Australia for less than two years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) The program savings from the initiative to extend the waiting period to two years are expected to be $31.4 million in 1996/97; $143.5 million in 1997/98; and $185.6 million in 1998/99.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) The administrative cost of the initiative has yet to be finalised by the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(8), (9) and (10) The answers to these questions were provided by my colleague, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural &amp; Affairs, on 17 June 1996 as part of Question No. 28.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(11) The social security waiting period of 26 weeks applies to migrants from the OECD countries. The waiting period is applied unilaterally by Australia under the domestic law. In the case of New Zealand citizens who enter Australia under the Trans Tasman Travel Arrangements the waiting period is applied under the social security agreement between Australia and New Zealand.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Travelling allowance payments made to Senate committee chairs have been tabled annually since 11 November 1991 when the Acting Deputy President (Senator Giles) first tabled them on behalf of President Sibraa, following a question on notice of 17 October 1991 by Senator Vanstone. Senator Giles informed the Senate: 1In keeping with the principle of making details of the remuneration and allowances of members of the Parliament publicly available, the President proposes in future to table this information at the end of each financial year. He has informed senators who chair committees of these arrangements'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In his answer to Senator Vanstone's question on notice about such tabling, President Sibraa said `I propose to table this material each year since I consider that it should be publicly available in the same way as many other details of parliamentarians' remuneration and allowances are now made <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2999"> public at the end of each financial year. (Senate Hansard, 12 November 1991, page 2993.)</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 16 September 1992, the Deputy President (Senator Colston) in tabling details of travelling allowance paid to Senate committee chairs also tabled similar details for committee members. He informed the Senate that `In the interests of completeness and in keeping with the principle of making details of the remuneration and allowances of members of the Parliament publicly available, I also table on behalf of the President details of allowances paid to senators who are not chairs of committees.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Following a question on notice from Senator Colston of 26 September 1995 to President Beahan, there is a proposal to table details of the travelling allowance paid to senators. This is in keeping with the principle of public disclosure which senators require of public officials at estimates hearings and in the Senate, and would increase the accountability of senators to the taxpaying public. Party leaders and independent senators are being consulted before the proposal is finalised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The views of the Privacy Commissioner have not been sought nor is it proposed to seek them as the practice of tabling details of travelling allowance payments accords with the principle that there should be maximum disclosure of the entitlements received by parliamentarians.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) Steps were taken in early 1995 to improve local councils' knowledge of their rights under the Telecommunications National Code (the Code). An information package containing a detailed plain English Guide to the provisions of the Code, a copy <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the Code, a copy of the regulations and a list of contacts was mailed to local councils and has been made available on request to councils and the general public. In addition the Government is in the process of revising the Telecommunications National Code. This follows an AUSTEL review of the Code. This process has enhanced the understanding by parties of the operations of the Code. I have recently published a new draft Code and directed AUSTEL to conduct a public inquiry into this Code. Once the new Code is introduced the Government intends to produce explanatory material which will be provided to each council. Consideration will also be given to whether there are any additional measures necessary to improve local councils' understanding of their rights and responsibilities under the new Code.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) The new draft Code contains stricter notification and consultation requirements and specifies information requirements for notification of councils.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) The new draft Code contains longer time frames in which councils can consult with the carriers, particularly where public notification and consultation is required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) The current regulatory framework governing the way in which carriers install their networks, including the carriers' current exemptions from State and Territory planning laws will continue until replaced by another scheme of proper planning processes, preferably from 1 July 1997. However, the new draft Telecommunications National Code require carriers to have regard to protection of the environment and heritage, particularly in declared areas. It also encourages dialogue between carrier and councils with regard to planning of telecommunications infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) The new draft Code requires carriers to provide information to be specified with regard to the electromagnetic energy (EME) emissions expected from radio facilities. With regard to the health effects of EME I am advised that the weight of national and international scientific opinion seems to be that there is no substantiated evidence of adverse health effects from EME emissions at typical levels. However, as science cannot prove a negative, the possibility cannot be ruled out. For this reason the Government takes community concerns about this issue seriously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A joint committee of officials has been set up to study EME public health issues and to ensure that health and safety concerns of the general public are addressed. Included in the committee's work are community information and dissemination programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The telecommunications carriers are required, under the Telecommunications National Code, to comply with industry standards likely to reduce risk <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3000"> to the safety of the public, including Australian Standard 2772.1, which establishes EME exposure levels that are considered, on the basis of current national and international scientific knowledge, to be safe. The Government has maintained this requirement in the new draft Code.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(f) The Code contains provisions which encourage carriers to co&hyphen;locate towers and similar structures to help minimise the environmental impact of these structures. The new draft includes provisions to encourage co&hyphen;location of telecommunications infrastructure including mobile telephone towers and cabling.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to the commitment to reviews given in `Reviving the Heartland', the Government will be proceeding with its program in an orderly way consistent with its policy priorities and the resource constraints it faces as a result of the budget position it inherited. Against that background, the Government is considering its options with respect to a number of the reviews listed and will take decisions in due course  consistent with its commitments. A range of critical issues to rural and regional Australia will be progressed through the work of the Activating Committee established following the Rural Finance Summit. Following is the situation with respect to those reviews on which action has been taken to this point:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i) The Countrylink review has been incorporated into a full review of the Rural Communities Access Program, which will be undertaken in two phases and which has commenced. The review will be undertaken by an outside consultant who has not yet been identified. The proposed completion date is early in 1997. The cost is yet to be determined but will be dependent on the tenders received. The Government will meet the cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii) As part of the Government's policy commitment in relation to farm families' access to social security payments, the Minister for Social Security, Senator Jocelyn Newman, is to establish a Special Rural Task Force to investigate the ongoing hardship and anomalies created by the application of the assets test in rural areas. I have been liaising with the Minister on the composition of the Task Force. The Minister for Social Security will shortly be announcing arrangements in relation to the Task Force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iii) I announced in May a review into the structure and effectiveness of the Meat Industry Council. It is being undertaken by a Meat Reform Steering Committee and Meat Reform Task Force. It is proposed that the work of this group will be concluded by September.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consultancy costs (including a financial efficiency audit) are being determined by the Steering Committee. These costs are expected to be between $200,000 and $250,000 and will be split between Meat Industry Council, Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation and Meat Research Corporation. The Government will meet the costs of Departmental staff involvement in the joint review as part of existing DPIE running costs and incidental <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3001"> expenditure on external advice expected at about $40,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iv) The Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs announced a review of Australia's anti-dumping and countervailing procedures on 26 June. The Chairman of the Review, Mr Lawrie Willett, is to report by the end of August.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(v) The Government has indicated it will require (1) that all imported products meet the same quarantine, hygiene, health and labelling standards as domestically produced goods and; (2) truth and accuracy in advertising, packaging and labelling, particularly in relation to country of origin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Changes to country of origin labelling for all products had been proposed through an amendment to the Trade Practices Act 1974. (The amendment Bill lapsed when Parliament was dissolved.)  The issue of country of origin labelling for food was referred to the National Food Authority (now Australia New Zealand Food Authority (ANZFA) from 1 July 1996) in 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ANZFA is continuing to develop a draft standard (for the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code) for labelling requirements based on a three tiered system to describe country of origin for food products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ANZFA Board will consider the draft standard, when it has been finalised, and decide on a submission to the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Council (of all Commonwealth and State Health Ministers plus the NZ Health Minister) seeking approval for the new labelling requirements. If agreed to, the new requirements will be adopted by reference into State and Territory food law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(vi) The Wheat Industry Fund (WIF) is a statutory fund administered by the Australian Wheat Board (AWB) under the Wheat Marketing Act 1989.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The WIF will be an integral component of the new structural arrangements for wheat marketing and the AWB which are currently being considered by the grains industry. Recommendations are expected to be made to Government during 1996/97.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would expect the commitment to review the management of the WIF to be satisfied by the broader consideration of  a new AWB structure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The grains industry, mainly through the AWB, is meeting its costs associated with the restructuring discussions and the Government is meeting its own costs. It is not possible to separate costs associated with the WIF from other costs of the restructuring discussions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(vii)Issues surrounding the taxation write-off arrangements for new horticultural plantations will be the subject of advice to me from the Australian <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) in the period up to December 1996. The cost of the advice will be met through ABARE running costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(viii) The operations of the Australian Horticultural Corporation (AHC) are the subject of ongoing review by the Horticulture 2000 Group which has been given the task of monitoring the role of the AHC as the designated `change agency' for the implementation of an export based growth strategy for the horticulture industry. The Horticulture 2000 Group was established in 1994.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Yes, the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation (SMEC) is currently under contract to AusAID to procure goods and related services under the Commodities Assistance Program (CASP).

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) No, goods procured under CASP do not have to be manufactured in Australia or New Zealand. Procurement follows Commonwealth purchasing guidelines. These guidelines require SMEC to arrange for an open and fair competitive selection process and to obtain value for money. Factors taken into account include price, technical merit and conformity, delivery time, after sales service and maintenance and warranty cover. Australian suppliers should not however be disadvantaged in the selection process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Yes, a tender was let under CASP arrangements for the provision of 4 large fire vehicles for the PNG Office of Civil Aviation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) No, a minimum of local content requirement was not one of the conditions of tender.</PARA>
