<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="10000">The PRESIDENT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to advise senators that Mr John Brudenall, the Deputy Parliamentary Librarian, retired on 7 August 1996 after 30 years of service to the parliament. I think that only the right honourable member for New England and the Clerk of the House of Representatives can look back on a continuous service record which is longer than Mr Brudenall's. He started when a Liberal coalition government was in power and he has retired when the Liberal coalition is again in power.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He had a commendable and distinguished career in parliamentary service, starting in the acquisitions and cataloguing area of the Old Parliament House when the staff then numbered only a few dozen, and he has retired at a time when the Parliamentary Library is one of the very best such services in the world with a staff of over 200 and a budget of $16 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In many ways John can be regarded as the father of the modern Parliamentary Library, for it was largely at his instigation and against a great deal of institutional resistance that he moved the library from being just a reference library and a reading service into a wider, modern, information technology world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Librarians of course regard books as important, and books are very important to John. He foresaw the coming of the electronic data age and it was under his guidance that the library moved from the card index and now to the Internet. It is without doubt one of the best equipped facilities in the world&mdash;as will <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> be attested to by many of us and our staff who have had to seek information in the library in a short span of time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John Brudenall will be remembered by his peers as a thoroughly professional librarian and public servant. He was honoured by the Library Association of Australia in 1986 when he was made a fellow of the association for his `contribution to parliamentary librarianship, to education for librarianship and to the library profession'. He was at all times a highly regarded professional in an institution which, more often than not, was not headed by a librarian. His urbanity and measured confidence will be missed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was perhaps of the `old school' of public servant who believed that his role was to remain in the background and advise, and his record of long and loyal service speaks for itself. We should and do acknowledge the service of Mr Brudenall. On behalf of all senators I wish him and his wife Sue great happiness in retirement and hope that from time to time he will be able to return and see his many friends in this building.</PARA></INTERJECT></PROCTEXT></DEBATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I now would like to ask Mr Alan Platt to come into the chamber so we can see him. Alan retires next Monday. I do not think many of us here can imagine the chamber without Alan in charge. He joined the department as an attendant in February 1982 and has been the chamber supervisor for 12 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Alan, the chamber operates effectively because of your efforts. You take enormous pride in your work and deliver an excellent service&mdash;sometimes, we would have to admit, in very trying circumstances. Alan always knows what is occurring in the chamber at any given moment and has the ability to anticipate what might occur, which of course means that we have an excellent service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Alan is fastidious in the way that he wants the chamber to operate and all of us have witnessed that first hand. I think it is fair to say that Alan regards the chamber as his own. He expects the highest standards from himself and certainly from the staff, all of whom have been trained so well by him. He has gained <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the respect and admiration of his staff and, in particular, of the senators he has served in this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week, the Department of the Senate recognised Alan's efforts by awarding him the prestigious meritorious service medallion and certificate, which recognises the outstanding performance of an individual in the Senate department. Alan Platt is very deserving of such an award. The role that Alan has played in the chamber will be sorely missed. In fact, I am sure that many of us cannot quite imagine coming back to the chamber in a couple of weeks from now and finding that he is not here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think all senators will want me to say to you, Alan: thank you for what you have done for us and thank you for your dedication and commitment to the task. We wish you very well in the future, and you will be sorely missed by all of us. I would like you to stand so that senators can acknowledge your contribution.</PARA></INTERJECT>

Frederick Meares Osborne CMG, DSC and Bar VRD, member of the House of Representatives for the Division of Evans, New South Wales, from 1949 to 1961, Minister for Customs and Excise in 1956, Minister for Air from 1956 to 1960 and Minister for Repatriation from 1960 to 1961, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2738"> </PARA>
<PARA>Madam President, Fred Osborne was born in Sydney on 20 January 1909. He was educated at North Sydney High School and Sydney Church of England Grammar School and went to the University of Sydney where he completed a degree in law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He had a distinguished naval career before entering federal politics. In 1938, with the threat of war looming in Europe, he joined the Royal Australian Naval Volunteer Reserve, was mobilised in 1939 and seconded to the Royal Navy from 1940 to 1946.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He commanded <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">HMAS Gentian, Vanquisher</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Peacock</EMPHASIS> in the Royal Navy and saw active service in the Atlantic during World War II. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross in 1940 for bravery and devotion to duty while assisting the evacuation of British and French forces from the coast of Norway. In 1945, while in command of the destroyer <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">HMAS Vanquisher</EMPHASIS>, he was awarded a Bar to his Distinguished Service Cross for the sinking of a German U&hyphen;boat in the Atlantic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He entered politics in 1949 when he first won the seat of Evans. In his maiden speech in parliament, he highlighted some of the immediate problems facing post&hyphen;war Australia: he drew attention to the shortage of housing and the countless human problems caused by this shortage; he saw the need to increase the production of building materials; and went on to highlight the splendid contribution being made by the migrant work force, encouraging the government to make every effort to assist these new Australians to settle and contribute to the future development of the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">His parliamentary career spanned some 12 years. As I mentioned earlier, he served in a number of portfolios in Menzies governments between 1956 and 1961. In addition, he also served on the House of Representatives Printing Committee, the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and also was a member of the Parliamentary Delegation to the Coronation of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II in 1953. He represented Australia in the inauguration of Ghana in 1957.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After leaving parliament in 1961, he re&hyphen;established his career as a commercial lawyer in Sydney and held positions on the boards of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a number of prominent Australian companies. He was President of the New South Wales Division of the Liberal Party from 1967 to 1970. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George for distinguished services to government and the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam President, Fred Osborne was an outstanding citizen, a staunch Liberal who gave great service to Australia both in war and in peacetime. I know that he will be sadly missed by all who knew him. On behalf of the government, I extend to his wife Elizabeth and children our most sincere sympathy in their bereavement. </PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the opposition, I wish to associate the opposition and opposition senators with the condolence motion moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Hill). We too express our regret at the death of Frederick Meares Osborne, a former minister, and offer sincere condolences to his family.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fred Osborne was not known to me personally but he was, by all accounts, a much admired man who was also known as a politician who cared very deeply for his constituents and vigorously defended their interests in the parliament. He was a Member of the House of Representatives for the Division of Evans in New South Wales from 1949 to 1961.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He certainly had a very distinguished naval career before entering politics. He joined the RAN Volunteer Reserve in 1938. In fact, he was seconded from the Royal Australian Navy to the Royal Navy and he was one of the few reservists to join the British navy and the only Australian to rise to the command of a destroyer. He commanded the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">HMS Gentian,</EMPHASIS> the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Vanquisher</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Peacock</EMPHASIS> and he was awarded two Distinguished Service Crosses during his naval career.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He won his first Distinguished Service Cross as a sub&hyphen;lieutenant on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">St Loman</EMPHASIS>, which was an armed trawler, for assisting very valiantly in the evacuation of British and French troops from the Norwegian coast, and he achieved the second DSC in 1945 when he <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2739"> was a lieutenant&hyphen;commander of the Royal Navy destroyer <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Vanquisher</EMPHASIS>, which in fact was responsible for sinking a German U&hyphen;boat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fred served in a diverse range of ministerial portfolios in the Menzies government, as outlined by Senator Hill. In 1956 he was appointed Minister for Customs and Excise and, later that year, Minister for Air, and in 1960 he became the Minister for Repatriation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fred Osborne will be remembered as an Australian who served this country with honour. Madam President, on behalf of the opposition, we offer our most sincere condolences to his family.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(9.45 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the condolence motion for Fred Osborne, who was a good friend of mine. We have heard that he became a reserve naval officer just prior to the war and, unusually for a reserve officer, he became the captain of at least two vessels, including destroyers. He always said that this was part of the formation of his essential character. He also said that in many ways this was the most enjoyable time of his life and that when he left his last ship when it was decommissioned he realised that life would never be the same. He always pointed out that this was an invaluable formative experience for him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fred had been spurred on by his family background. He became a great achiever in politics, in law and in business but if you asked those who knew him what were his quintessential characters they would probably say they were integrity and decency, qualities which Fred made sure he passed on to his family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard a list of his great achievements&mdash;a superb record and one which I believe is not often surpassed. I will not repeat it in detail; Fred's proud record stands for itself. It includes some 12 years in parliament with five years as a minister in the Menzies government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It could be said of Fred that he came from a kinder, gentler age but Fred was a kinder, gentler man. But he was much more than that; he was a very determined achiever but a very <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> warm human being who was essentially nourished by a firm belief in the essential virtues of humankind and by the importance of community service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">His contribution to the Liberal Party, to this parliament, to his family&mdash;in particular, his son Michael, who is following in his footsteps in the Liberal Party in New South Wales, his daughter Imogen and his wife Elizabeth&mdash;and perhaps most importantly to society is incomparable. I think it is fair to say that all of us agree that Fred will be sorely missed.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(9.47 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to associate members of the National Party in the Senate with the condolence motion moved by Senator Hill. Frederick Osborne was a man of immense achievement: a decorated naval veteran who displayed great courage and valour during the naval battles of the Second World War and a distinguished minister in a variety of portfolios in the Menzies government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Frederick Osborne was born in 1909 in Orange and was educated at Sydney Church of England Grammar School, St Andrew's College and the University of Sydney where he studied law. After graduation he practised commercial law and joined the Royal Australian Navy Volunteer Reserve in 1938. The outbreak of the Second World War saw him enlist as a regular in the Royal Navy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Frederick Osborne's naval career was characterised by courageous actions and the unfaltering and superb leadership with which he exercised his commands. As a sub&hyphen;lieutenant on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">St Loman</EMPHASIS>, his courageous actions in assisting with the rescue of British and French forces saw him awarded a Distinguished Service Cross. His great capabilities led to his promotion to lieutenant and his commands of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">HMS Gentian</EMPHASIS>, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Vanquisher</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Peacock</EMPHASIS> for the remainder of the war. As commander of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gentian</EMPHASIS> he was charged with the extremely risky mission of escorting allied convoys in the battle of the Atlantic while under sustained air and U&hyphen;boat attack. It was as lieutenant commander aboard the destroyer the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Vanquisher</EMPHASIS> in 1945 that he received his second Distinguished Service Cross for sinking a German U&hyphen;boat.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2740">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After the war, Frederick Osborne found himself looking to federal politics as an area where he could make a further contribution to public life. To that end he was elected member for the New South Wales seat of Evans in the new Menzies government of 1949. His abundant natural capabilities were quickly recognised by Menzies who called on him to serve in a variety of ministerial portfolios. He was Minister for Customs and Excise in 1956, Minister for the Air from 1956 to 1960 and Minister for Repatriation from 1960 to 1961.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A man of immense talent and drive, it was a great loss to the Menzies government that his ministerial career was cut short by the very tight election of 1961 when he lost his seat by only a handful of votes. His commitment to the Liberal Party never waned and he went on to serve his party as president of the New South Wales division. He also served as Director of the Australian Ballet Foundation for 10 years from 1979 to 1987.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Frederick Osborne made a huge contribution to Australian life. The courage and leadership he exhibited during his naval years were of heroic proportions that few could match. He made an equally distinguished contribution to government during his six years as a minister. I am sure all honourable senators will join with me in extending sympathy to Frederick Osborne's widow, Elizabeth, his family and many friends.</PARA>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>Phil Lucock was born in Eltham, Kent, England on 16 January 1916. He studied theology, but interrupted his studies to enlist in the Royal Australian Air Force in 1941. After his discharge from the RAAF he resumed his studies and became a minister of the Presbyterian Church.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He entered federal politics in 1952 when he won the New South Wales seat of Lyne. In his first speech in parliament he spoke of the economic difficulties facing Australia at the time, in particular the need to contain inflation&mdash;a subject which is as relevant today as it was then. He also reflected on the pressures borne by the government of the day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Phil's long parliamentary career saw him embrace many issues of public concern. In speeches in this parliament during his last days before his retirement in 1980 he commented on a wide range of issues, including the Western economic system, the level of state borrowings, the role of the backbencher, the role of the media and the ultimate accountability of each member to his or her electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Phil was a firm believer in each and every individual playing a part and making a contribution so that Australia could continue to be the lucky country. He was true to his belief and made many significant contributions during his 28 years in this parliament. In addition to holding the offices of Deputy Chairman of Committees and Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees, he also provided valuable service to a range of parliamentary committees. He was chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Printing. He served on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Standing Orders, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Privileges, the House of Representatives Select  Committee on <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2741"> Pharmaceutical Benefits, the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence and the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1971, he was appointed a Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire for his service to the community and to the parliament. He enjoyed a long and distinguished career in this parliament&mdash;a career marked by his gentleness and compassion, and a special understanding of the trials and tribulations of politicians and government. In an article published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> shortly after his retirement in 1980, he wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Today, more than ever before, the real strength of government is tested by the need to make unpopular decisions that will benefit all Australians in the future.</PARA>

Philip Lucock made an enormous contribution to Australian public life as a federal parliamentarian for 28 years, including service as Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees for a record 12 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Philip Lucock was born in 1916 in England. He studied theology at St Andrews Theological Hall in Sydney until the Second World War intervened and he promptly enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force. Following his medical discharge from the RAAF in 1942, he resumed his studies and was ordained as a Presbyterian minister in 1948.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1952, the Country Party prevailed on him to contest the seat of Lyne in a by-election following the death of the sitting member, James Eggins. He won the seat and held it for almost 29 years, winning 11 elections along the way, until his retirement in 1980. Despite his successful contesting of Lyne, Philip Lucock maintained his ecclesiastical commitments by conducting dozens of church services each year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a thoughtful first speech to the parliament, Philip Lucock spoke about Australia's place in an unsustainable world following the incursions in Korea and Malaysia. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The dangers that exist can only be overcome if we show clearly that we are prepared to sacrifice comforts in order to safeguard the freedom of our country and the great traditions of our democracy.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>Prophetically he also spoke of the need to increase primary production in order not only <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2742"> to meet Australia's needs but also to make a contribution to the food requirements of Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During Philip Lucock's long parliamentary career he was appointed to the challenging positions of Chairman of Committees and Deputy Speaker twice under Menzies and later under Malcolm Fraser. He first held the office of Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees from 1961 to 1973. He was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1971 in recognition of his great service to the community and the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During his long career Philip Lucock also served as Acting Speaker in the House on various occasions, as well as Chairman of the Printing Committee, Vice&hyphen;Chairman of the Joint Foreign Affairs Committee from 1959 to 1961, and the Joint Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee from 1973 to 1975. His great parliamentary experience and expertise was called on by the Fraser Government in 1976 and he again assumed the office of Deputy Speaker and Chair of Committees until 1978.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During his 28 years in the parliament, Philip Lucock never faltered in his advocacy for the Country Party and the people of Lyne. His appreciation for the primacy of the parliamentary system never faltered. From the day he entered parliament to his final day almost 29 years later he remained committed to his belief that at all times it was imperative to remain a conscientious advocate for his constituents. In his valedictory speech he stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The House of Representatives is the most important forum in Australia and the most humble person has the right to have his case presented and argued by his member of parliament.</PARA>
<PARA>During the valedictory debates there was a warm, bipartisan commendation of Philip Lucock's long parliamentary career. The government Leader of the House at the time, Ian Sinclair, praised the devotion with which Philip Lucock served his constituents and hailed him as a man `who has won the hearts of the honourable members of the House.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Philip Lucock made a great contribution to Australian life through his war duty, his long and diligent parliamentary work and his lifelong commitment to the Presbyterian <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Church. He will long be remembered by the people of Lyne for his long and faithful service. I am sure all honourable senators will join with me in extending sympathy to Philip Lucock's family and friends.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam President, it was my privilege to serve as a colleague of Philip Lucock in the House of Representatives during the last five of his distinguished 28 years of service to this parliament. As has already been mentioned, his service during part of that period was as Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees of the House of Representatives. He served a record term in that office. I particularly remember his courtesy and kindness as Deputy Speaker to a new, relatively young MP in those days. He was ever helpful with advice from the chair for a young MP who was learning the ropes and I was grateful to him for that helpful advice on a number of occasions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, as has been mentioned, he was an ordained Presbyterian minister. It was in that capacity that he was a very active member and, for a time, an office bearer of the Parliamentary Christian Fellowship within this parliament. It was in that particular role that I probably got to know Phil best. He was very committed to that group. He served it well and the strength of that organisation during his period in parliament was due, in no small measure, to the active involvement and support which he gave it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After his retirement in 1980 he reverted more actively to his role as a Presbyterian minister. From time to time, he visited Adelaide in that capacity and I had the chance to catch up with him. He maintained his enthusiasm for the political process, notwithstanding his retirement, and was always interested in what was happening in this place and to hear news of his former colleagues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a privilege to have served with him for the last five years of his term in parliament as a House of Representatives colleague. It is in that context that I wish to associate myself with this condolence motion.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam President, I too would like to join with other honourable senators in this <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2743"> condolence motion. I knew Philip Lucock for the last five years of his service in the House of Representatives. He was a very fine member of parliament and a very considerate and compassionate colleague. He was the type of person who would be very interested in what your family was doing and how they were. Very often I forget that particular aspect, which should be very important to us. It was very important and much appreciated by me during the long illness of my wife. As Senator Chapman has said, Phil Lucock was a very dedicated member of the Parliamentary Christian Fellowship. It was from those Christian principles that flowed his consideration of his fellow human being.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was very strong on the need for parliamentarians to be accountable to their electorate. As has been said, he was a member of the House of Representatives for 28 years. In order to serve for 28 years he had to be elected no fewer than 12 times. I do not think he would give too many thanks to certain Prime Ministers who were interested in double dissolutions&mdash;they will remain unnamed at this stage. It is no wonder he had the very strongly entrenched view that members of parliament should be accountable to their electorate. He certainly was and the electorate of Lyne continued to return Phil Lucock, and justifiably so. I would also like to express my condolences to his children Robert, Ian, Patricia and Alison and to their families.</PARA>

<STATE> (Victoria)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(10.34 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find it extraordinary that Senator Kemp could suggest to this Senate that there is something wrong with the proposition to extend the time for this report because at the committee hearing yesterday this proposition was seconded by Senator Michael Baume. Senator <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2755"> Michael Baume seconded this proposition and your briefing should have included some very basic facts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those basic facts go to the way in which this government has behaved in regard to this inquiry and whether or not this government has sought to frustrate the work of this committee. Quite clearly, what we saw from government senators throughout this inquiry was quite a deliberate campaign to undermine and attack witnesses who put points of view different from those of Senator Alston.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You could expect, however, that Telstra, being a publicly owned corporation, would respond appropriately, fully and with complete cooperation with this inquiry. What concerns me is whether or not that is in fact the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A series of documents were sought by me concerning project Mercury, which you are well aware is a plan, which was instituted by this government after its election, for the removal of one-third of the employees in Telstra. It is a plan by this government, despite its commitments not to engage in the structural separation of Telstra&mdash;that is, the carving up of the company&mdash;to gut Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We asked for documents about a project which had come to my attention, a project which was not denied by the officers of Telstra. Documents were then provided to us on an in-confidence basis&mdash;quite extraordinary! Documents that I have been handing out all over the country were given back to us on an in-confidence basis. What an extraordinary proposition that somehow or other this committee can be provided with material on an in-confidence basis&mdash;that is, secret; we are not supposed to talk about it&mdash;when it is common knowledge and publicly admitted throughout the length and breadth of this country. We are talking about the removal of some 24,000 jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We want to have a look at those documents since they were delivered to us on Monday. We want to have a good look at them to make sure that they are the documents that we have asked for and that they are a complete list of the documents that we asked for because I can tell you, in terms of some of the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> documents that I have, that they are not a complete list.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have is an attempt, I think, by this government to direct Telstra management to carve up that company contrary to this government's election commitments, contrary to the statements made to this parliament, in an attempt to destroy this company, in an attempt to undermine the living standards of one-third of the employees of Telstra and then to somehow or another mislead the committee as to the way in which that is being done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Officers of Telstra were asked direct questions as to whether or not they had a head count target. They denied it. The documents clearly indicate that they did have a head count target. So there is no doubt in my mind that this government has had a program to undermine Telstra, quite contrary to all that has been said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been stated that the South Australian government has not responded to the questions that have been put on notice. That is clearly the case. What happened in South Australia is that the government of South Australia, the Liberal government of South Australia, acknowledged the very serious and profound effect that the privatisation of Telstra would have on regional employment in South Australia. Quite extraordinary job losses will occur in South Australia as a result of this government's actions in destroying one of Australia's great public companies. We asked the South Australian government to answer a few basic questions. They have failed to do it. What we are seeing right throughout this country is a campaign by the Liberal Party not to cooperate with this inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We come to the third proposition that is involved in this motion; that is, the cuts that have been imposed on this parliament by this government which require at least a week's gap between the preparation of documents and the printing of them&mdash;quite an extraordinary proposition, particularly given an inquiry of this complexity with its some 650 submissions. It is a very serious inquiry. There have been quite detailed and serious responses highly complex in nature, and they require the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2756"> committee to analyse them in some detail to make sure we get it right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does this government do? It imposes cuts on this parliament so that the documents cannot be printed, so that this chamber is restricted in its capacity to have information. The people of this country are restricted in their capacity to have documents made available as a result of the work of committees of this parliament. The documents from Telstra were delivered to us after the deadlines for those printing requirements&mdash;which of course have been imposed as a result of budget cuts by this government&mdash;had passed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When it is all seen in context, we understand that your briefing, Senator Kemp, should have been a little more complete. You should have understood that it was Senator Baume who strongly supported this proposition yesterday. He, for one, has made very clear his very grave concern about the way in which Telstra and its senior officers have treated this parliament and the contempt they have shown towards this inquiry by trying to mislead it and cover their tracks by trying to give us documents on an in&hyphen;confidence basis. That is quite an extraordinary proposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is this parliament's right to determine what is and what is not in confidence. Quite clearly, the committee needs to look at the documents that go to the meetings of project Mercury, the target counts that they have identified and their attempts to sell off Visionstream, for instance&mdash;a whole series of measures that quite clearly demonstrate that this government's word is not worth the paper it is written on. Of course, they try to cover it up by suggesting that we cannot talk about that in a public way. This committee needs to look at those documents, and I think quite properly so. Senator Baume made it very clear yesterday that that clearly was his view as well, and that is presumably why he seconded this proposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have is quite clearly a case of gross hypocrisy. This government does not even intend to introduce the legislation until the week beginning 9 September. From what I heard Senator Hill say on TV last night, I think that might be a very optimistic timetable. It is quite clear no attempt has been <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> made here by this government to push an earlier timetable for this legislation. What you have are your documents, your own records, setting down, Senator Kemp, that you do not intend to discuss this legislation until at least that week, and I would suggest it will be perhaps a bit longer than that in terms of possible delays.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this proposition before the Senate does is allow the committee to do its job properly&mdash;quite contrary to the campaign of deliberate frustration that we have had to encounter from this government and from Telstra management. It is very interesting to look at who is actually supporting the privatisation of Telstra. The key supporters are the management of Telstra, who will gain massively in terms of market salaries&mdash;huge increases in salaries will come to them&mdash;and market analysts, who will enjoy enormous benefits as a result of the privatisation of Telstra. But very few other people in this country support the privatisation of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I am not surprised in the slightest at the way in which the management have treated this committee. We have seen over many years the way in which they have treated parliamentary committees. This is unfortunate, given that one of the great strengths of Telstra is its public accountability&mdash;the capacity of ordinary Australians to know, through this parliament, what is going on inside one of Australia's great companies. It seems to me that you, Senator Kemp, would be better advised to get some better advice because quite clearly you have not got a clue.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support Senator Lees's proposition. It is with great pain I have to admit in this Senate I was wrong. I was highly critical of John Howard's decision to downgrade the two Kemp brothers. I was highly critical of the fact that two eminent Victorians had been reduced down the ranks&mdash;one from being the shadow minister for the environment to being out of the ministry, and the other into a junior portfolio. But Senator Kemp's contribution here today has proved me wrong and John Howard right.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think I should share this with the Senate: I was informed only yesterday by an eminent <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2757"> scientist that he had discovered a new mushroom in a cave in the Blue Mountains&mdash;way down the back, in the dark&mdash;that lived off a certain form of fertiliser. And do you know what, colleagues? He has named it the Kemp mushroom. We heard the reason today. It was obvious from Senator Kemp's performance today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I rose for this one reason only: I sat on the other side of the chamber a few months ago one day on chamber duty when seven coalition chairmen of committees came in here and moved for extensions of time for inquiries. All were transacted within 20 minutes. So for Senator Kemp to get up here today and say that he really does not want this vital committee to extend its time by two weeks, which will not actually interfere in the legislative consideration of the subject under consideration, is absolutely demeaning to the position of manager of government business in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Poorly briefed as always, inarticulate as always, Senator Kemp is merely going through the motions, pretending to be a manager and waiting for the reshuffle when he will finally go back to the back bench where he belongs. You have to lift your game here, Senator Kemp. You actually have to bend with the wind on occasions and pick your fights in this chamber, and this one was not worth picking. This was not worth picking because the offer that has been made to you is that the committee will bring down its report before we get to the substantive debate on the Telstra bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Also, Senator Lees and Senator Carr gave substantively good reasons for the extension. It has not been through a lack of diligence from the committee members. Looking at their onerous timetable, I have immense sympathy and admiration for the massive amount of work people have put into this Telstra inquiry, and you should not belittle it, Senator Kemp. It is true&mdash;it is on the record&mdash;that Telstra itself was late in responding to questions. Had the committee brought a report in and not considered those late answers by Telstra, you would have been the first one to jump to your feet and say that the committee did not take everything into con sideration. This is a reasonable request. I think you should let us get on with it and grant the motion.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak briefly to this motion because I was amongst, as most non-government senators were, those people who helped draft the words to the inquiry into Telstra. The reason these words were carefully drafted was that there was concern that many of the problems the community had were not problems in the bill but were problems not mentioned in the bill. That was why it was necessary to carefully draft the reference so that the concerns about going a new step would be able to be dealt with in the inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Added to that was concern for the prospective witnesses to this inquiry. If people wanted to bring in those concerns about what was not mentioned in an inadequate bill, then they would be likely to be abused by government members of the committee. So for many reasons, including the lack of desire to have people face that kind of treatment, the various non-government senators looked carefully at the wording of the inquiry to make sure that the community had the chance to put those views about their concerns to the whole package and issue as widely as they could.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem is that we failed. We failed because, despite the ability or what should have been the ability of members of the Australian community to speak to various terms of reference without having to speak word for word on the bill, there were many <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2758"> witnesses who were abused during this inquiry. They were abused and intimidated. I would go as far as to say that those witnesses were bullied. I was ashamed to see that treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People from the eastern states who were wishing to give evidence were contacting my office and saying, `I've been listening to the inquiry and I'm really quite concerned about giving evidence to the inquiry because I don't want to be treated that way.' We advised them to state very clearly that they were speaking to a particular term of reference and that they did not purport to be an expert in every aspect of the bill or in telecommunications, but that they had the right to speak to a term of reference. That did not stop them from being intimidated and abused.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think this was a shameful way for the government senators involved to behave and I think it does no good at all. It probably means that they wish to restrict that kind of information from going on the public record. I would certainly like to say that the Senate has not heard the last of my concerns on this issue.</PARA>

He did not turn up and we did not have a quorum to discuss any of these matters. I left a message on Senator Collins's answering machine&mdash;and I am pleased that he is sitting here&mdash;and Senator Collins turned up at that meeting, at which I gave an explanation of where we were at. He accepted and voted for the motion as recorded in the minutes on that matter. The minutes read `that the Committee meet in Canberra or at other venues to be determined by the Chairman on Monday, 5 and Tuesday, 6 August 1996 in order to hold public hearings into the provisions of the Airports Bill 1996 and the Airports (Transitional) Bill 1996'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposal that was put to the government members of that committee by Senator Conroy was that he would like to have meetings in Melbourne, not Sydney. The  proposition that was put from Senator Woodley, also a member of that committee, was that he would like to have meetings in Sydney. The government members&mdash;and I in particular&mdash;said that in this inquiry and because we were in up weeks it was an opportunity, as Sydney was not in the first tranche, also to have hearings in either Perth or Adelaide or both. That came from us. Because there was no attendance at those meetings and the matter was not progressed, I did say privately to Senator Conroy and Senator Woodley that the situation required a compromise of minds to handle it because a lot of us, as we all know, were involved in other hearings. In my case, it was the industrial relations hearings. No agreement was reached by the time we got to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that particular meeting that Senator Collins came to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to look at the words of that motion that I have read out: `that the Committee meet in Canberra or at other venues to be determined by the Chairman'. That was me. At no stage after that meeting did I have a request from anyone else to consider another venue. In fact, if we go a little bit further&mdash;and I would need to check this with the secretariat&mdash;I believe that we actually heard from everybody who put in a submission and, because of the interest shown, we did not meet on two days; we met on one day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are other matters in terms of amendments which we will deal with when we debate the bill, but we did not have the request for any more meetings. At no stage was there any request to go beyond that motion which I would have considered. I think it is quite out of place for Senator Conroy to make these charges against the government members of the committee because we were more than reasonable in trying to determine where we should go and how we should handle this. We even discussed the possibility at one stage of looking at Brisbane as well. In the final analysis we came down to one hearing, which dealt with the witnesses that were before us. Your request to go to Melbourne was not denied, but you never delivered any individuals from Melbourne who wanted to appear, other than representatives from the Victorian government. There was nobody from Sydney, other than the mayor of Bankstown.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Conroy, to pick up Senator Ray's words in a debate a little while ago, you have picked the wrong issue to have a fight on. Every opportunity was given to you; you could not agree with the Democrats on the particular position, and it was when Senator Collins came to the meeting that we were able to progress the work of the committee.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>The regulations contain a range of 32 fees for the classification activities of the classification board introduced by the former government. They came into effect on 1 January 1996 in conjunction with the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995 which represented the Commonwealth government's contribution to the introduction of a virtually national scheme of censorship and classification.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate referred the regulations to the committee for inquiry and report after receiving representations from several major industry groups that some of the fees were a 100 per cent increase on the previous fee and had been imposed with only 12 days notice and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2762"> without prior consultation with the industry as had been foreshadowed by government representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee had a public hearing in Sydney on 15 July 1996 at which government and industry representatives were able to put their respective positions on the regulations. The committee was informed that the fee increases represented the first stage of the former government's plans for the introduction of a substantial cost recovery for the classification activities of the Office of Film and Literature Classification.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In recognition that the fees had not been increased for the major classification function in relation to film and videos for some 12 years, the then government had decided that as an interim step it would increase these fees by the CPI increase. A firm of private accountants is currently conducting a study of the Office of Film and Literature Classification with a view to assessing the manner in which it carries out its classification tasks and to determine the appropriate user&hyphen;pay fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee has found that the fees contained in the regulations are set at a realistic level for the classification services that the Office of Film and Literature Classification provides and is recommending to the Senate that the regulations not be disallowed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee took particular note that after some six months experience with the new fees, there was no evidence of adverse effects on the industry's operations. It also noted that the fees charged by comparable overseas classification bodies for equivalent services were considerably higher than those in the regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee did accept, however, that a number of concerns raised by the industry groups about the operations of the Office of Film and Literature Classification had some validity and it made recommendations to ensure that all elements of the industry are closely consulted in future about the process of introducing user&hyphen;pay within the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee also believes that because of the significance for both the community and the industry of the reforms currently under way, it should closely monitor the review <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> process and it has recommended that no future fees be imposed on the industry until the basis of those fees has been subjected to a detailed examination by the committee.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The bill was introduced in the Senate on 23 June 1996 and considered by the Senate on 25 and 26 June 1996. The bill was amended by the Senate. The key amendments by the Senate were to remove provisions which would enable the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs to appoint an administrator to administer ATSIC's affairs in certain circumstances, reduce the size of ATSIC's regional councils and provide for the appointment of the commission chairman by the minister. The government cannot accept these amendments. As a consequence, the government decided to introduce a new bill in the House of Representatives in identical terms to that introduced in the Senate on 23 June 1996. This bill was passed by the House of Representatives last night.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill proposes certain amendments affecting the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, commonly referred to as ATSIC, and to the structure and operating arrangements for regional councils established under the ATSIC Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most significant amendments in the bill provide for:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">a reduction in the size of Regional Councils; </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">selection and appointment of the Chairman of the Commission by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">improved accountability arrangements for regional councils; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">appointment of an administrator to manage the operations of ATSIC if the administration of public money by ATSIC has been fraudulent or has involved gross mismanagement, or if ATSIC has intentionally failed to comply with a general direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When ATSIC came into being, a little over six years ago, it was recognised as representing a unique experiment in public administration. Nothing like it had been tried before, in Australia or overseas. A review by ATSIC of the operation of the ATSIC Act was completed in early 1993 and a number of significant recommendations for change were made as a result of that review. Amongst those recommendations were recommendations for a reduction in the number of regional councils and for the Commission Chairman to be elected by the elected zone commissioners, rather than being chosen by the Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The recommendation to reduce the number of regional councils was aimed at increasing management efficiency and enabling better servicing and resourcing of regional councils.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The recommendation to provide for an elected Commission Chairman was based on the notion that this would be consistent with the principles of empowerment, self-determination and self-management which were the basis of ATSIC's establishment. Nevertheless, the commission's report containing this recommendation did acknowledge that the question of appointment of the Commission Chairman was a complex issue. The report expressed that, in many ways, the chairman is the primary link and source of day-to-day advice between the commission and the government. It went on to say that the chairman must be a person in whom the government may have total confidence, at the same time as having the confidence and trust of, and the ability to represent, all members of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community.  </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2764">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former government accepted both of the recommendations for amendment to the ATSIC Act at that time. Consequently, a 1993 amendment to the ATSIC Act provided for a reduction in the number of regional councils from 60 to 36. The reduction in the number of regional councils took effect for the round of regional council elections conducted on 4 December 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1993 amendment to the ATSIC Act also included amendments which provided for a fully elected board of 17 ATSIC Commissioners, with the members of that board to elect one of their number to be Commission Chairman. However, these amendments were expressed to be effective from 1 July 1996 and were therefore intended to affect arrangements for the next Board of Commissioners following the next round of regional council elections, due to be held later this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following completion of the 1993 round of ATSIC regional council elections and the subsequent zone elections, an independent panel was convened under section 141 of the ATSIC Act to review ATSIC's boundaries and electoral systems. The review panel conducted consultation meetings in 20 locations throughout the country. Its report to the former minister on its review of electoral systems was completed in March 1995 and was tabled in the House of Representatives on 11 May 1995 and in the Senate on 30 May 1995. One of the recommendations of the review panel was that the size of regional councils be reduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently the number of members on a regional council is dependent on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population of the region and ranges from a low of 10 for regions with an estimated population of less than 1,000 people, to a high of 20 for regions with an estimated population of 10,000 or more. The review panel proposed that the act be amended to provide for regional councils to be comprised of eight members for regions of less than 1,000 people, increasing to a maximum of 12 members for regions with a population exceeding 10,000 people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The initiative was seen as one which would facilitate more effective and efficient operations by regional councils. In essence, it was <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the view of the review panel that the larger a regional council is, beyond an optimum size, the more unwieldy it is and the less effective it is in the performance of its functions. The review panel's report included advice of concerns that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">under current arrangements, decision making processes are unnecessarily protracted due to the size of the regional councils;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">many councillors, who are often elected with minimal community support, have little interest in or make little contribution to regional council operations; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">administrative expenditure associated with the operation of regional councils (including travelling allowance and fees for members) should be kept to the minimum necessary so that the money available to address community needs can be maximised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government accepts the recommendation of the review panel to reduce the size of regional councils and the basis for the recommendation. The proposed amendment will contribute to greater efficiency in regional council operations and reduced administrative costs associated with the operation of regional councils. It will also help to ensure that membership on regional councils is gained on the basis of a more appropriate level of community support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regarding selection of a Commission Chairman, the government acknowledges the importance of democratic principles in assisting the achievement of greater self-management and independent decision making. However, the government maintains that it must retain an appropriate degree of control and accountability where large amounts of government funds are being administered. This is basically because we operate in a system of Westminster government and there is nothing like ATSIC anywhere else in the Westminster system. In the end it is the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs who is accountable before the parliament. Selection of a Commission Chairman by government is central to the achievement of this objective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently the Board of Commissioners is comprised of 17 elected commissioners and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2765"> 2 commissioners chosen by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. The minister is required to appoint one of the 19 commissioners to be Commission Chairman.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment proposed in this bill would have the effect of retaining the current arrangements so that, following the next round of zone elections, the 17 elected commissioners would not elect one of their number to be Commission Chairman. Rather, a further 2 commissioners would be appointed by the minister, who would then appoint one of the 19 commissioners to be Commission Chairman.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another significant area addressed by the bill is the improvement of accountability arrangements for regional councils. In the interest of greater public accountability, the bill includes amendments to make regional council meetings open to the public and to give the public an entitlement to inspect a range of regional council documents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the proposed arrangements, regional council meetings will generally be open to the public but will be able to be closed in certain circumstances, similar to those in which local government meetings can be closed. Such circumstances include where commercial-in-confidence and personal privacy issues are being discussed, and where it is necessary to deal with disruptive conduct. Additionally, the public will have an entitlement to inspect regional council codes of conduct, written procedures for meetings, management plans, written policy documents relating to the payment of expenses and provision of facilities to regional councillors, minutes of meetings (except where the meeting or the minutes are closed in relation to the exceptions I have mentioned) and other documents which would otherwise be accessible under freedom of information legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill also allows for the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs to appoint an Administrator to ATSIC or to the Torres Strait Regional Authority in the event that the minister is satisfied that the administration of public money by the ATSIC Board of Commissioners or by the Torres Strait Regional Authority members involves <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> fraud or gross mismanagement. The minister would also be able to appoint an administrator should ATSIC or the Torres Strait Regional Authority breach a direction given to it by the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This power will enable the government to oversee the administration of public money by ATSIC and the Torres Strait Regional Authority and to act quickly to stop any misuse of taxpayers' money. Of course, I would expect that the appointment of an administrator would be resorted to only in extreme circumstances. In fact, I hope that an administrator will never be necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once appointed the administrator would assume control of the organisation's property and affairs and perform the powers and functions normally undertaken by ATSIC or the Torres Strait Regional Authority as the case may be. The organisation would continue to operate with the administrator making decisions which would otherwise be made by the ATSIC Board of Commissioners or the Torres Strait Islander Regional Authority members. In this way the provision of services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people would proceed with minimal disruption while whatever problems identified are examined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The administrator will be able to conduct reviews and recommend changes to the structure and operations of ATSIC or the Torres Strait Regional Authority . This would ensure that the difficulties which led to the appointment of the administrator can be remedied during the administrator's appointment and will not be repeated in the future. In this way, the elected representatives would be in the best possible position to resume control when the appointment of the administrator ends.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the end, this is necessary given as I said before that the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs is the person under the Westminster system who is responsible to the parliament for the expenditure of public funds even by a body such as ATSIC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA>I note in moving this amendment that there are a significant list of speakers who wish to contribute to this debate on the airports legislation. I am pleased to see that because it is an important issue. I am sure that a diverse range of views will be expressed as has been the case in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's position, the previous opposition's position, on this legislation in the past was about as disgracefully opportunistic as you could have seen with respect to any kind of rational program for the operation of Australian airports, particularly the operation of Sydney airport. Honourable senators would recall that when we proposed the sale of the airports the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), who was concerned about the possibility of loss of support in his own seat, blocked the sale. Proposals were introduced into parliament on the pretext of being concerned about the effect of noise on the residents of Sydney, particularly the residents of his own electorate. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2767">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We pointed out at the time, in some detail, the unblushing hypocrisy of that particular decision, considering the number of times people like me&mdash;former transport ministers with direct experience of the need to construct, at the earliest possible time, the third runway or second parallel runway at Sydney airport&mdash;had been berated by the coalition parties. To then see people who were at the vanguard of that debate protesting about noise at Sydney airport and wanting airport sales deferred until the noise problems could be sorted out we thought was a bit rich, but we did not know at that point what was going to happen with Holsworthy. If you thought that the double standard, duplicity and deceit that was involved with the general public concerned with this issue over the third runway was bad, Holsworthy was a blinder and remains a blinder.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You would recall that the now Minister for Transport and Regional Development, Mr Sharp, presented, as his case for not saying anything about this, the unbelievable&mdash;literally unbelievable for those of us who had been transport ministers&mdash;story that he was prevented from saying anything about the meeting he had had with the proponents of Holsworthy because it was a commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence arrangement. Of course, as I was well aware, the people who had been pushing this proposal for some time were not concerned in the slightest about any commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidentiality with the fact that the proposition was actually around. They had no difficulty with it. So that was the thinnest and the most transparent of the deceits that were committed by the now government&mdash;the then opposition&mdash;on this particular issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find myself in an interesting position in respect of debate on this matter in that I have a slight degree of freedom now in opposition that I did not have in government. I am a strong supporter of the proposition that has underpinned our Australian democracy since day one&mdash;of a collegiate government and cabinet solidarity. It is absolutely crucial although, at times, individually uncomfortable for all of us who operate within it. It has been one of the great contributors to the stability of the Australian political system and, with all <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the faults and failings of two major political parties&mdash;the same kind of system that operates in the United States, but entrenched to a greater degree in the US than it is here&mdash;has provided a degree of that stability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason I make those digressive remarks is that I have to confess to Almighty God, and to you here present, that I was not an enthusiastic supporter of the sale of the Federal Airports Corporation and I remain an unenthusiastic supporter of the sale of the FAC. As minister, I was a very enthusiastic proponent of the amalgamation and complete sale of our two airlines. For a period of something in excess of 20 years, those airlines between them had not contributed sufficient dividends to their shareholders to build a decent high school. They were always, understandably, with their hands out for more money from the budget to increase their requirements&mdash;legitimate requirements in an expanding, volatile and very difficult aviation market. You really have to like the smell of kerosene to be in the airline business. It is difficult at the best of times to make a quid out of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of good public policy, I was a strong supporter of that decision. It was the correct decision and I supported it. However, I was not at all happy about the situation with the FAC. Senator Tambling, who is in the chamber, would be very well aware of the domestic political reasons why I would not have been happy about the sale of the FAC; that is, the absolutely crucial role that the Federal Airports Corporation played in having the magnificent airport terminals constructed at Alice Springs and Darwin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Territorians such as Senator Tambling and I&mdash;long&hyphen;term territorians as we both are&mdash;can now say, absolutely unblushingly, what an enormous asset both those terminals have proven to be. We knew the old facilities were bad and we protested loud and long that they were. In fact, they were so bad that they were inhibiting the growth of the tourism industry to the Northern Territory. I want to give great credit to the Federal Airports Corporation and to the then minister, then Senator Gareth Evans&mdash;and to his senior advisers, whom I got the ear of; in many ways that is far more <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2768"> important in lobbying terms than getting the ear of the minister&mdash;for the support that I got for having the Federal Airports Corporation put both of those airports on their list.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason that I give this example and am not talking about the ones that are always in the news&mdash;Sydney and Melbourne, understandably&mdash;is that it is a classic example of the real national benefit that, in my view, the Federal Airports Corporation provided to Australia as one of the, in my view, most successful publicly owned enterprises that we had in Australia. There was, no doubt, a cross&hyphen;subsidisation involved in that operation&mdash;no question about it; right up front&mdash;within that network of quality terminals across the length and breadth of Australia. I felt then, and I still feel now, that there is a national benefit in real terms, particularly for overseas visitors, in having such a national network of high quality airports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know I would get no argument from Senator Tambling by saying that prior to the establishment of the FAC we did not have that. We had some reasonable terminals around Australia but in other parts of Australia, where international visitors are visiting in increasing numbers, we had some shocking facilities. The ones in the Northern Territory were abysmal. People used to complain about Darwin. But Darwin was nowhere near as bad as Alice Springs, which was standing room only most of the time and a very busy airport indeed. The Federal Airports Corporation constructed two world&hyphen;class facilities at Darwin and Alice which absolutely transformed the face of Northern Territory tourism. It did it without any impost at all on the budget but by the cross&hyphen;subsidisation that goes on inside that network.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was, of course, bound&mdash;just as I undertake to be bound when I choose to join a mainstream political party such as the Australian Labor Party&mdash;by the collective decision taken at the end of the day. That was not a debate I won, but I was happy to abide by that decision. My loyalty to the Australian Labor Party is absolute. I might tell you, Madam Acting Deputy President, that is a loyalty that will never waver. No matter what might happen to me in the slings and arrows of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> outrageous fortune that descend on us all from time to time in this business, and no matter how aggrieved I might feel from time to time about decisions that do not suit me within the Australian Labor Party, I will take that loyalty to the Australian Labor Party to my grave.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator BOB COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Herron, I happen to have that view and, quite frankly, I do not think you would disagree with me in respect of, as I said, the major political parties in Australia. That view, in my opinion, would apply to members of the Liberal Party and the National Party. We are at the end of the day none of us here as a result entirely of our own efforts. Independents, of course, who choose to become independents have to foot their own bills, pay their way themselves and go out and do the hard slog. Those of us who go under a party banner have some loyalty to that party when we get into parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not complaining, I want to make it clear, about being bound by a collective decision regarding the FAC that did not suit me at the time. I loyally supported that decision. But&mdash;again I am not embarrassed to say this&mdash;I make no bones about saying, particularly from a parish pump territory perspective, and I am a territory politician, that the FAC did a great job by the Northern Territory. It was particularly in respect of those smaller regional airports that I think the FAC did Australia a major national service. The reason I said that was to get the smile on Senator Murphy's face that I see is now there.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator BOB COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We could all do with a bit of an image improvement from time to time, Senator O'Chee. The fact is that those of us who do live in an Australia which is outside of Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne are very conscious of the sensitivities attached to the operations of regional airports&mdash;and I know Senator Murphy will have a lot to say on this in his contribution to the debate. They are legitimate concerns and remain legitimate concerns. They are certainly concerns of mine. I have an intense personal interest in the future disposition of those major assets in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2769"> the Northern Territory, Alice Springs and Darwin airport terminals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not a person who is silly enough to believe that, by shouting `privatisation' at something, it instantly becomes a more efficient or effective operation. That is not always the case. The Federal Airports Corporation, I think&mdash;and the record is there out in public in their annual reports for anyone to see&mdash;have done a superb job in constructing a network of world class facilities that are a credit to this country. They have done it off the budget. They have done it by commercially operating within their charter. They have turned around a lot of absolute lemons. It is to their absolute credit and I feel that this should be placed on the record: they had some absolute duds on their books when they first started operations, as you know, Mr Acting Deputy President.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To the great credit and commercial acumen of the people who operate, and continue to operate, inside that organisation, I believe that a superb commercial job has been done by them in bringing in that bottom line; in staying in the black; in servicing their debts in an effective way; and in operating airport terminals around Australia with, at the same time, some of the world's lowest airport charges. And a comparison with other major airports around the world will show that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the reasons I make that point, on behalf of the employees of the Federal Airports Corporation, is that I understand the potential might exist for local ownership by people who want to own the airports&mdash;and I am talking about city councils now&mdash;who have no expertise in actually operating and managing airports but who wish to use an organisation like the Federal Airports Corporation to run those operations. I repeat: I believe that the FAC have done an absolutely superb job for Australia in operating those airports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have mixed feelings indeed about rising in this debate on propositions that will actually see that network disbanded. I am delighted that the government at least has caved in, as Senator Conroy has said quite correctly, under the pressure put on them by the opposition about the cross-ownership propositions which <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> I thought were absolutely appalling. Had the original government proposition gone through this parliament to effectively replace what is a very effective public monopoly with what would have effectively and simply been a private monopoly&mdash;and that would have been the result, had they been allowed to get away with it&mdash;it would have been a disastrous result indeed, particularly for rural and regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, I refer again to those of us who do choose to live outside of Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra who once again have been kicked in the teeth&mdash;this time by the budget that was delivered last night&mdash;with those places being made even more difficult to live in. I noticed in passing that on transport issues&mdash;and I recall the caning I got as transport minister but, I might also add, particularly as primary industries minister from coalition politicians and organisations like the National Farmers Federation on the hypothecation of fuel excise&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Did the NFF protest? The NFF last night put out a press release saying what a fantastic budget this was for the bush. Perhaps they have put out a supplementary release, but I have seen nothing. I used to get belted around the flat by organisations such as the NFF about things like proper transport for regional Australia&mdash;roads as well as airports. The fact is that life has been made, again, far more difficult for regional Australia, as you have noted, Senator, by the NFF's blinding hypocrisy on this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2770"> To be honest, I could not believe it when I saw in the budget papers that $600 million has been taken out of the national highways system by this federal government that pon tificated on this issue right around regional Australia. I say again to the government and indeed to my own colleagues that, for those of us who live in regional Australia, concerns about what is going to happen to our airports remain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The amendment to the second reading that I have moved in this debate on behalf of the opposition is self-explanatory. I refer honourable senators particularly to paragraph (c) of the amendment, which specifically points out the completely inadequate draft EIS guidelines for the proposed Holsworthy site. The shadow minister for transport, Mr Tanner, has at some length gone into the debate on the stupidity and duplicity of the Holsworthy option, so I will not unnecessarily detain the Senate by going over that ground again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I do want to put this on the record for a second time: I was speechless at the now minister's unbelievable explanation that the only reason he said nothing about Holsworthy&mdash;until it was too late for the electorate concerned&mdash;was because of some commercial-in-confidence obligations he had. I knew about that proposition when I was transport minister, as Laurie Brereton has said he knew about it when he was transport minister. The proponents had no difficulty in it being known that they wanted to develop that site. Forget the details of the proposal; it was a transparent piece of duplicity by the now government and the present transport minister on that issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You cannot sensibly proceed with this debate until the question of Holsworthy has been absolutely determined. The EIS guidelines are utterly inadequate for Holsworthy. The reasons why Holsworthy was even put up as a blind, as I suspect it was by the government, and for all the machinations on KSA would probably still not be known publicly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say again in conclusion&mdash;other speakers from the opposition will speak for themselves about their own particular parts of the country&mdash;the opposition's real concern about what happens at airports around Australia other than Sydney and Melbourne remains as acute as it was when we were in government. That concern, of course, when we were in government is on the public record in terms of the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> process that was required to get the decision to sell the FAC. None of that concern has abated, as Senator Murphy will tell the Senate shortly. We certainly want to hear as much detail as possible from the government in this debate, particularly when we have a Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Senator Tambling) in an ideal position to tell us what is going to happen to airports like Alice Springs and Darwin. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS> </PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the Airports Bill 1996 and the Airports (Transitional) Bill 1996. Listening to Senator Bob Collins, I am more and more convinced that the Australian Democrats' position on this, which will be to oppose the bills, is substantiated. I regret that party solidarity really does not allow him to vote according to his conscience because on this one he is absolutely right. He is absolutely right in what he has been saying in raising all of the problems that the privatisation of the FAC is going to bring to this country. The proposition is a disaster. I wish that the Labor Party could follow the conscience of Senator Collins, because he is absolutely right.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The airports bills are a prime example of how the policy thrust of the new coalition government is travelling down a path cleared for them, unfortunately, by the previous Labor Party government. These bills will be passed in a form which will now be almost identical to the bills debated before this chamber towards the end of last year. With the bringing back of the prevention of cross&hyphen;ownership clauses into the bill, it means that the Labor Party no doubt will support it because it brings the bill back into line with the one that the Labor Party put before us last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Given that the bills and the issues are so similar, I intend to draw on a speech made by the Leader of the Australian Democrats (Senator Kernot) in this place last year when she very eloquently put our position. It is very hard to improve upon what she said, so I will draw on some of her words. She said at the time:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This legislation implements the decision of this Labor government to have a Clayton's sell-off of federal airports. It is a sell-off you are having when <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2771"> you are not having a sell-off because, instead of selling the airports outright, we are selling the right to run airports for 50 years.</PARA>
<PARA>What the coalition is doing in this area, as in so many other cases, would not be possible if the Labor Party had not prepared the way. I am afraid that the recent squeals on the policy directions of the government from the Leader of the Labor Party, Mr Beazley, ring hollow in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats oppose these bills because they act against the interests of the general public, they act against the long-term benefit of the economy and they remove opportunities for accountability to the public. I am sad that the Labor Party is prepared to support these latest privatisation initiatives. It highlights how much they have been compromised by their record in government. The Labor Party has blazed a trail of privatisation in this country: a clear-felling of a forest of public assets has occurred and most of the one-off cash inflows from these fire sales have already been squandered. We find the Labor Party lining up again to support the coalition from the sidelines, as they even more enthusiastically take up the privatisation torch.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, let me commend Senator Collins on his second reading amendment. There is no doubt that the Democrats would support that amendment because it underlines the problems that the very bill itself will bring to us. The amendment, in some ways, is a recognition of the very problem that the bill itself creates. So we will support that second reading amendment because it simply underlines the position we take in opposing the bill as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill itself contains principles which are meant to underlie the leasing process. These principles include: that airports must be majority owned; that the government will seek diversity of ownership to the maximum extent possible; that there is encouragement towards transparency and benchmark competition between the airports; and that they seek separate ownership of Sydney, including Sydney West, from Melbourne and Brisbane airports. There is also provision for the ownership of airports by individual airlines <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and associated interests to be restricted to five per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth will retain responsibility for land use, planning and building controls at the major airports. The Commonwealth will retain reserve powers to deal with demand management issues that may arise during the 50&hyphen;year leases. The Airports Bill also sets out details of the post&hyphen;leasing regulatory arrangements to apply to the airports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In outline, that is what the bill seeks to do. It simply reinforces the key question which the Democrats continue to ask: why is the privatisation of airports necessary? The answer, of course, is that privatisation is not necessary. Virtually all major airports overseas have been publicly owned and operated. That is a fact. Australians should be asking why we are deviating from this principle. The Democrats would argue that little, if any, micro-economic benefit will flow from the new airports regulatory regime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are told that competition will force down airport usage prices. The reality, in the case of airports, is that scope for competition between Sydney and Melbourne, for example, or between Sydney and Perth airports is very remote. In fact, it is a ridiculous proposition. Not only is disaggregation against the world best practice of keeping airports together in a network, it is also against the advice of the FAC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is hard to see how anyone could seriously believe that there could be significant competition between airports in Australia. Just to state it makes obvious how ridiculous such a proposition is. Clearly, people fly to destinations because of location attractions&mdash;not just because of the airport. They are not going to fly to Melbourne in preference to Sydney because they like the airport lounge in Melbourne better. They fly to the destination because that is where they want to go. The proposition just leaves me speechless&mdash;and that is unusual for me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The merit for breaking up the very profitable FAC into a string of single airport companies is also not immediately evident. The FAC, and many industry observers, are not convinced. Like many other decisions of the previous government&mdash;and even more so <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2772"> of this government&mdash;this so-called reform is likely to impact even more negatively on regional Australia. Senator Collins was more eloquent than I could be about the effect on regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a monopoly, the consumer benefits of the private sector running airports are only as good as the regulator overseeing them. We need to ask some fundamental questions, beginning with: are our airports now inefficient? Will the private sector run them so much better that the regulators might be able to force them to deliver lower costs? The Democrats believe the answer is no.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The FAC is a very profitable government business  enterprise. Last year, it recorded a profit of $128 million. Sydney airport recorded a $69 million profit, Melbourne, $52.3 million, and Brisbane, $43.5 million. By the standards of the Stock Exchange, its earnings over assets ratio is up there among the top three or four firms&mdash;ahead of the big Australian BHP and ahead of News Corporation. Its productivity, measured by the passenger per employee ratio, increased by 14 per cent in 1994-95 following the 15 per cent improvement the previous year. What more do you want from a company? I really have to say to you that this is a crazy proposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Its fees are the fourth lowest of a world representative listing of 40 major airports, with increases kept below the CPI over the past five years. What more do you want FAC to do? They are doing a fantastic job. This is an organisation which is achieving the shareholders' objectives. Why on earth&mdash;and I nearly used a word I wouldn't use&mdash;are we selling it? The Australian people, as the shareholders, are entitled to continue to ask this question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Airports, by their nature, are incredibly influential on the quality of life of nearby communities. Communities should be entitled to express their views on demand management at airports. They should be entitled to express their views on things like&mdash;and surely the political lesson has been underlined over Sydney&mdash;curfews, noise, usage, tourism promotion, the balance between general aviation and commercial aviation, and so on.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The running of an airport every day requires a long string of decisions made in the public interest. It is impossible to divorce the commercial aspect of running an airport from the public policy aspect. For more than almost any other utility, the Democrats believe this is the case. In short, there is a good, long list of reasons why airports should stay in public hands and few reasons why they should be in private sector hands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the privatisation wave across the world, virtually no other country outside the lunacy of Margaret Thatcher's Great Britain has sold its airports, because other governments throughout the world realise that to do so is to get rid of a utility that is too vital to a community, to its commerce, to its quality of life and to its environment to be trusted to private sector hands. That is not to disparage the private sector, but it is to point out a few obvious things. There are no market forces to constrain the private sector on airports. Competition will be at the margins only.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats have made accountability one of our core issues since our inception nearly 20 years ago. All Australians know how hard it can be at times to make governments and government bodies accountable. The chance of a privately owned company&mdash;one where the major shareholder is not the government, but more likely an overseas investor&mdash;having accountability to the Australian people as its primary objective is practically zilch. It becomes much harder for the public interest to get a look&hyphen;in when the company is run solely for the private interest of the shareholders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ideologically driven obsession of the coalition and Labor parties with privatisation has yet to show any benefits. We should assess privatisation on a case by case basis. In doing so, we should be seeking to determine whether in all the circumstances it is of economic benefit and of community benefit for the asset to pass from public to private ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On airports we can unambiguously state that the benefits of this bill to the community at large will be negligible. It is time community interest and social interest were once again given consideration by governments. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2773"> We should learn from the third runway debate in this country that community impact is just as important as financial impact. The Democrats are opposing these two bills and urge the Senate to vote against them on economic grounds, on public policy grounds and on environmental grounds.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was not surprising in the HMCA submission that it expressed concerns about the impact of full cost recovery following the leasing of the Hobart airport. A study conducted by the Federal Airports Corporation in 1993 for the Institute of Industry and Economic Research indicated that the application of full cost recovery principles for our local airport would raise landing charges by 194 per cent and cause a devastating blow to the local tourism numbers of between 11,000 and 21,000. That same report indicated that the loss of revenue to the Tasmanian economy would be in the order of $11 million to $22 million. They made the point that this would be totally unacceptable and no doubt lead to a significant increase in unemployment and the loss of many tourism operators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The HMCA on behalf of the southern Tasmanian council members made the point that the Hobart airport must continue to operate in the best interests of all users. I understand that there is a proposal being formulated for a joint authority of southern Tasmanian councils who will submit a proposal at some stage in the future&mdash;when the second tranche of sales comes up, I believe&mdash;to the Commonwealth requesting that they be given a lease over the Hobart airport.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You will have your chance, Senator Murphy. I believe your name is further down the speakers list. If you have some problems, you should raise them then rather than keep interrupting me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Tambling indicated that the government would wish to adhere to the tendering process. In situations such as Hobart, where there is a strong community of interest in ensuring local ownership, then these criteria must be acknowledged. I trust that the government will see fit to consider the benefits which local ownership could bring in terms of job and business development in regional communities throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recall comments made at the hearing by some of the government's advisers about more communication with community groups&mdash;with the likes of the HMCA&mdash;about the effect that the sale of, for instance, Hobart and Launceston airports would have. Also noted at the hearing was the apparent success of the ALOP scheme with airports such as Wynyard, Devonport&mdash;which Senator Murphy would know of&mdash;and Mackay. We were told that that scheme has worked very well, and that was noted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also took note of a fact that came out as a result of a question I asked about Hobart's debt. I was told, much to my pleasure, that the Hobart and Launceston airports would be sold debt free, which I think is very significant. As Senator Murphy would know, one of the major reasons Hobart in particular has been showing a trading loss is its indebtedness. If that airport is sold debt free, then its new owners will be more likely to be able to conduct the works of that airport in a profitable manner and therefore not be put in a position of having to increase landing charges and the like to the detriment of tourism and other services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The HMCA also raised that some essential capital works need to be carried out before a prospective buyer can be found. I guess the market will determine that further down the track. I do not believe it would be unusual if the government made a decision like that, because I note that some $29 million will be spent on extending the Adelaide airstrip before that airport is sold.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As already indicated by Senator Bob Collins, our committee recommended that these bills be agreed to subject to the amendments notified to the committee by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp). I support our committee's wish to draw to the minister's attention the comments made by state, territory and local governments expressing concern about the selection of future airport lessees. Although it could be said that I have a vested interest in relation to Hobart and Launceston airports and their future ownership, I considered the points raised by the councils, and no doubt similar points would be raised by the Launceston Port Authority, for instance; I think they would make the same sorts of comments&mdash;that they would far prefer to see local ownership of what we would have to class as regional airports.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5F4">Senator CALVERT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think you can raise that with the minister or the parliamentary secretary. The minister will answer those questions. I think the indications are&mdash;if you had been at the hearing you would have heard this&mdash;that, as far as the second tranche of sales is concerned, the principles and success of the ALOP scheme have been noted. I am of the opinion that further discussions would be held with airports such as Hobart and Launceston before those matters are resolved. It would be totally unacceptable for private interests to control airports where it could detrimentally affect the local community. I think all those matters have to be taken into account before the smaller airports are sold, because it could have a devastating effect on the local community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was the reason why our committee recommended that the minister raise with the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) the need to ensure that the selection process which takes place takes into account the broader development and economic concerns of particular regional areas. I support that recommendation, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2775"> and I encourage the minister, before he makes a decision, to consult the state, territory and local governments which made submissions to our committee, to ensure that he fully understands their reasoning and their concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of other state, territory and local governments expressed concerns about the lack of consultation which they perceived could occur under the bill. Although, again, my colleague Senator Tambling has indicated the opportunity to resolve matters of concern by negotiation, I feel it was a strong view of those making submissions to our committee that this would not go far enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During our hearing the First Assistant Secretary, Aviation Policy, Mr Peter Harris, indicated that he would be raising this issue with Minister Sharp, seeking consultation in advance of plans being released by the minister under the statutory requirements in this legislation. I think it is fair to say that all those who gave evidence to our committee did raise quite strongly the point about consultation. Our committee has seen fit to formally recommend to the government the establishment of a clear consultative process because we feel such a critical process as this must ensure that there are clear&hyphen;cut guidelines in place from the outset.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also note the assurances that were given, particularly to local councils, that the Commonwealth was unwilling to concede to the state and local government authorities control of land use planning and building developments on its land. We do know that Commonwealth control of planning and building could ensure a consistent regime for all major airports, but I think that, again, this does not go far enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just as an aside, as a former warden of the municipality which controls the Hobart airport and member of the Mayoral Aviation Council, I know that many years ago we voiced concerns about the unsatisfactory situation regarding local government's lack of control over airports around Australia. As a result of some of our concerns, the previous government&mdash;I think it was then Senator Gareth Evans&mdash;gave us an assurance in writing that airports would pay the equivalent of local <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government rates where they considered it appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that situation is a little loose and could be tightened. We need consistency across the board in Australia as far as where local governments and state governments fit in is concerned. As I mentioned at the hearings, we could have a situation where, if it is Commonwealth property, people can conduct businesses without having to pay rates. They could be protected from paying rates and have an unfair advantage over private operators in nearby areas. I think this has happened in Western Australia</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that the Commonwealth comes to some arrangement with state and local governments about these concerns that were raised during the inquiry, and I think they were reflected in our recommendations. If that does not occur, it may provide an opportunity for unscrupulous operators to bypass the normal controls. That was a concern that was raised by local government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of other matters which the committee has sought to bring to the minister's attention as a result of the submissions. Obviously areas such as a national invoicing code and economic regulation and charging principles will have a big impact on the flow-on effect to those users of our airport networks. I believe there again that they warrant some consideration by the minister. Whilst the committee has raised a number of points of concern, they are not fundamental to the general principle of these bills but perhaps better represent a finetuning which will ensure that our airports are used more effectively on behalf of our local communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support the bills and the government's amendments. I encourage the minister to look very carefully at the recommendations which have been made by the committee. I think the opposition's concerns have been largely covered in their amendment. I do not have too many problems with one or two parts of that amendment, but I would like further time to consider my attitude to part (c) of Senator Bob Collins's amendment. I guess those matters will come up in the committee stage.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government's legislation, as has been indicated, mirrors largely the legislation put before the parliament by the former government. On that basis, it is generally supported by the opposition. But, as has also been clearly outlined by Senator Bob Collins, the government has been dragged kicking and screaming back to the position that the Labor government had on this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I rise to support the amendment moved by Senator Bob Collins and particularly that aspect of the amendment which goes to the proposal for Sydney's second airport. This government, in its decision to relist Holsworthy as a potential site for Sydney's second airport, has demonstrated clearly the length it will go to to deceive the people of this country and particularly the people of Sydney. I just want to recount very briefly the sequence of events because, as has been the case for a long time, whenever the coalition has been in government it has approached the situation of dealing with Sydney's airport needs in an underhand, deceitful manner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We must never forget that it was the coalition, along with its colleagues in the state Liberal government at the time, that so strongly pushed the development of the third runway at Sydney and then turned in the latter stages to attack the Labor government merely for base political purposes&mdash;that is, to pander to the legitimate outcry of the many residents affected by aircraft noise in Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is unfortunate that we have airports which clearly create environmental problems, particularly aircraft noise, for communities. Sydney suffers probably more than just about any other city in the world in that respect.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> But this government treats this issue as a political issue. Prior to the election the Leader of the Opposition at the time and now Prime Minister, John Howard, and other shadow spokespersons, including Senator Parer, were firmly on the record&mdash;not once, not twice, but dozens of times&mdash;as saying that they supported Badgerys Creek, Sydney West airport, as the site for Sydney's second airport. Indeed, John Howard gave evidence to the Senate Select Committee on Aircraft Noise, of which I was a member and which looked in detail at <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this issue last year. He gave evidence on 25 July. I would like to quote what he said on that occasion. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">What you have to do is to look at the short&hyphen; and medium&hyphen;term problem, which is the unfair noise burden being carried by a limited number of people. That has to be fixed; it is the first and most important thing. Obviously there are then the alternative airport needs. As I understand it, both parties have commitments in relation to Badgerys Creek, although I know that some evidence is put from time to time that Badgerys Creek raises difficulties and that some people argue for alternatives to Badgerys Creek. Certainly I am appearing here as the member for Bennelong, although it is hard to discard other hats. Our parties have a commitment in relation to Badgerys Creek which I reiterate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">But the short-term problem is the problem that is exercising people's minds very acutely at present, which is the noise burden problem. As far as the longer&hyphen;term problem is concerned, we do need an alternative; there is no doubt about that. We do need additional airport capacity in this city. Some people have put to me that that should ultimately replace Kingsford Smith. It is not an argument that I am adopting. I want to make it clear that I am not adopting that argument. I would not adopt that argument unless I were completely satisfied that it was a realistic and practical option to put. I am not satisfied at present that that exists, so I am not adopting it.</PARA>
<PARA>So the now Prime Minister was then on the record, as the Leader of the Opposition and as the member for Bennelong, as being concerned about the impact of aircraft noise on people in his electorate, as supporting Badgerys Creek and as rejecting the concept of an alternative site as a replacement airport for Kingsford Smith.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can recall that when this legislation put up by the then Labor government for the sale of the airports came before the parliament last year the then Leader of the Opposition and the coalition used that legislation to in effect defeat the government's attempt to implement the process of sale by linking it to the reopening of the east&hyphen;west runway. They moved amendments which sought to tie the two issues together to therefore frustrate the government's processes. So it is very relevant, in considering this legislation, to be aware of that history because at the time the then Leader of the Opposition, John Howard, frustrated legislation similar to this legislation, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2777"> for his own political purposes to get the east&hyphen;west runway open. He went to the election saying, `We will reopen the east&hyphen;west runway, and we support Badgerys Creek'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was never any mention of Holsworthy. Never once were the people of Wattle Grove, Holsworthy, Hammondville or Liverpool&mdash;all those people in those surrounding communities, the southern shire&mdash;told that what this government had in mind was putting Holsworthy back on the agenda as a site for Sydney's second airport, nor that it was put on the agenda not as simply an overflow site in the way that Badgerys Creek was to be seen as an airport complementary to Sydney, but rather for the potential establishment of Sydney's major airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was what was announced by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, Mr Sharp, a couple of months ago. He announced, out of the blue, with no warning&mdash;not even a warning to the local member, a member of his own Liberal Party&mdash;that they were going to put Holsworthy back on the agenda. He announced that the EIS to be conducted into Badgerys Creek, the EIS which had been implemented by the previous Labor government, would now be expanded to include Holsworthy. Most importantly, Holsworthy was to be included on the basis that one of those two sites would have an airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is one of the major problems with the EIS process that now exists with respect to Badgerys Creek and Holsworthy, as Senator Bob Collins has identified in his amendment. The draft EIS guidelines for the proposed Holsworthy site are entirely inadequate. One of the major things missing is the opportunity for consideration of other alternatives such as an airport at neither site.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his newsletter to his electorate at Bennelong, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Howard report</EMPHASIS>, the Prime Minister is on the record as saying to Bennelong residents:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sydney is to be guaranteed a second international airport regardless of the outcome of the Environmental Impact Statement at Badgerys Creek.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The EIS (Environmental Impact Statement) process will now be broadened to include an alternative site&mdash;the Holsworthy Military Reserve, in Sydney's <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> south&hyphen;west. This will ensure a fall&hyphen;back option is immediately available if the Badgerys Creek EIS proves unfavourable.</PARA>
<PARA>Further, when we look at the proposal put up by the Department of Transport and Regional Development with respect to the location and development of the second Sydney airport, it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposal is to consider the construction and operation of a second major international/domestic airport for Sydney at either Badgerys Creek or Holsworthy on a site large enough for future expansion of the airport if required.</PARA>
<PARA>So we have gone from a position where this government when in opposition supported Badgerys Creek, and supported the Labor government proposal that Badgerys Creek would be constructed and run complementary with KSA, to the position we are now in where we will have an EIS into the Badgerys Creek site and the Holsworthy site with the potential that one of those two sites will be a major international and domestic airport, way beyond what was ever envisaged for Sydney West airport&mdash;a potential replacement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why the people of Holsworthy and surrounding areas are so irate. They knew that on at least two previous occasions back in the 1980s that site had been rejected as being totally unsuitable. In fact, in 1985 Holsworthy did not even make it to the short list because it was so unsuitable for various environmental and other reasons. Not only were they not told that Holsworthy was going to be put back on the agenda, but they now know that this proposal to put Holsworthy into the EIS process means that it has the potential for future expansion because, of the two sites, it is the only one that fits the bill. I am not sure, but Holsworthy is probably five to 10 times bigger than Badgerys Creek and, of those two sites, it is the only site that could cope with an expanded airport in the future. On the proposal as it stands, there is clearly an in&hyphen;built bias towards the Holsworthy site. Yet what is being said constantly by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Transport and Regional Development is, `We still prefer Badgerys Creek.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other aspects of the EIS&mdash;and I do not wish to go into them today as I will have plenty of opportunities to do so in the future&mdash;are <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2778"> seriously deficient. Firstly, as I have said, there is an EIS here which is structured so that a choice is made between one of two sites&mdash;but one of them has to succeed. That is the whole basis for it; there is no opportunity for both of them to be ruled out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been made very clear by the Environment  Protection Agency that, when you have an EIS, you start from the premise that the proposal is being supported, and you then look at its impact to see if you can find ways of ameliorating the impact. When the EIS is drafted, the consultants do not start from a totally objective position&mdash;`Well, should we or should we not have an airport on this site?' They start from a position of being told, `Here is a proposal to have an airport; you consider its impact.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, therefore, there is a bias in the process, as there is in all the EISs that have been undertaken, towards favouring the development of the proposal rather than not. I understand that the statistics are that only in about three out of 100 cases does an EIS ever come out with a recommendation which totally opposes the proposal that is being put up to be examined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a whole range of other deficiencies. The amount of community involvement that is envisaged in this EIS process for Holsworthy&mdash;and I dare say for Badgerys Creek but particularly for Holsworthy, given that it has only recently been put onto the agenda&mdash;is nothing short of woeful. The guidelines were issued on 22 July; the people were given approximately four weeks to respond. There was a toll free number that nobody could get through on&mdash;I know that, having tried for days&mdash;because they were inundated with requests. Many people had not even seen the draft guidelines until maybe a matter of a week or two ago, yet they were due to close on 19 August. How can you possibly have community involvement in an EIS process on a matter as important and as sensitive as this and allow a lousy four weeks for people to obtain the draft guidelines, read them, understand them, dissect them, comment on them and get a submission back to the EPA?</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, what happened was that, because of the terrific organisation in the local community by community leaders, they went out and educated the people and brought to their attention the deficiencies in this proposal&mdash;because the EPA did not do it. The EPA had three meetings. I attended one of them, and it was a total disaster. I requested the EPA to hold a meeting in the Sutherland shire and they would not hold one. They said they could not find a hall big enough. If that does not show that there is a need to hold one, I do not know what does.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last Friday, due to the efforts of the community organisations opposing this airport, some 30,000&hyphen;plus submissions were lodged with the EPA&mdash;not due to any great opportunity for the community to respond but due to the massive amount of work put in by community representatives of the South&hyphen;West Sydney Community Alliance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a whole range of deficiencies in the EIS guidelines. It is said by the minister that the EIS process will be run in accordance with the recommendations of the report of the Senate Select Committee on Aircraft Noise in Sydney, of which I was a member. It was a large report presented in this chamber last year, one of the recommendations of which was that there needs to be the most open, transparent EIS process and there needs to be every opportunity for community representatives to be involved in the process right throughout; they need to have access to the technical information that is provided to the consultants and upon which they prepare the EIS. There is none of that in the current guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have just indicated to you, the people in the community have been treated with utter contempt. First of all, they were deceived. People purchased ex&hyphen;army land to build their houses in places like Wattle Grove. Thousands of people have moved into this area over the past 10 years or so, in the firm belief that there would never be an airport at Holsworthy because it had been rejected. Secondly, they are not told before the election that they are going to get an airport in their backyard but they are told straight after&mdash;another broken promise. Then when the EIS <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2779"> draft guidelines are handed down, they are totally inadequate and there is very little opportunity for the people to participate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I could go on, but the point that needs to be reiterated is that this government's policy on airports is an absolute disgrace. You have neglected the interests of the Sydney residents for years and years: you never did anything about addressing the problems of Sydney airport in all those long years when you were in government. Now that you have got back into government again you are putting thousands and thousands of people living in the south&hyphen;west of Sydney&mdash;not on the North Shore, not in the Liberal held seats&mdash;into a state of utter distress and anguish because of your policy on airport development.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. I spoke on that last year. I will just say that airports are monopolies, there is no competition between airports in different cities. For example, in Western Australia you can go to Perth airport <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> or you can go to Perth airport. There are other cities in Western Australia but if you want to fly to Europe there is not a lot of choice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, the only ways that concerns like the maintenance of low cost regional airports or management of social and environmental impacts can be met where the airports are not owned directly by government is through extensive regulation. That is why we have this Airports Bill; it tries to cover all the things people want to ensure happen with airports by specifying them in law as requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nothing here will protect regional airports which have been cross&hyphen;subsidised in the past. The virtually inevitable outcome will be higher costs for rural people&mdash;government users such as flying doctors. In fact, a fair bit of the use of regional airports may be by government agencies, and I expect that that will increase as government closes down rural offices of all sorts. Fly&hyphen;in fly&hyphen;out rural services will perhaps have some difficulties. So I expect that it will be government as well as rural people who will pay the cost of this policy. Then again, some airports may just shut down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since this is simply a recycled bill from the previous government cleansed of the coalition's own amendment requiring a solution, part solution or proportion of a solution to the airport noise problem, I expect the now opposition will support it, meaning it will pass, in spite of the fact that the Greens will again oppose it. Nevertheless, we will suggest a few amendments in the Airports Bill which I believe work to preserve the intention of the ALP when they put forward the bill last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments to the Airports Bill concern parts 5 and 6 which detail the requirements for the master plans, development plans and environmental strategies. I am quite certain, having received various briefings and assurances, that the Labor Party intended these requirements and the requirements for consultation to ensure that private sector managers of airports should behave responsibly and be responsive to the public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once the government is no longer the manager of airports, the only way of ensuring responsiveness and accountability is through some mechanism such as these plans and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2780"> requirements that they be implemented and penalties for failure. We owe it to the people whose airports we are selling to do a good job on these kinds of requirements. It would not surprise many honourable senators to know that many people in the community are not fully assured that many of these requirements will be met.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At issue is the real people who have to live around the airports, live with the sound of morning rush, evening rush, planes going overhead every few minutes for a period of hours, not being able to speak on a phone without having to stop and wait for the passing of a plane, the roar drowning out the sound of voices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Airports have generally had buffer areas around them&mdash;areas to keep the houses from being built too closely. Government owned and operated the airports so the buffer zones were also publicly owned and managed. These will go with the airports and present new opportunities for commercial development by the airports' managers. You can put sound&hyphen;proofing over those which means you can basically get these at an ultra&hyphen;bargain price, especially if you have ratted off the neighbours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Airports will also expand to maybe include hotels and other services for travellers. Planes will get bigger and louder and air traffic heavier. There will be pressure to expand out into the buffer areas. It is important to manage these plans and ensure that the additional burden put on people nearby is acceptable&mdash;acceptable to the people affected, not just to some bureaucrat or corporate bean counter who considers a bit of sacrifice by some as essential to growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problems that have been obvious to people are the ones where somehow or other a person in one house was considered to be affected and the person in the next house was not considered to be affected. Part of our concern that we will be putting in our amendments will deal with the level of noise that is a problem so that the remedy, whether it is by a private operator of an airport, has to be based on the noise effect and not just some <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> definition of which areas are affected by wingspan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These buffer areas are also often areas of ecological significance. Airports are usually initially sited on less desirable land, often near water or wetlands. It makes sense to put an airport near water where planes are not taking off over land, over houses. This has meant that in an odd way airports have acted to preserve remnant areas of original bush or wetlands&mdash;original landscape.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter I wish to raise this afternoon is the unfortunate assault on Monday on our nation's Parliament House by extremist elements. A number of fundamental questions and issues arise as a result of what occurred last Monday. Most important&mdash;and I trust we all cherish it&mdash;is the right to freedom of speech and the right to demonstrate. Unfortunately, the events on Monday will put pressure on the Presiding Officers and other people around this place to try to limit the demonstrations near Parliament House and the right of people to give voice to their feelings and views. It is my hope that the ugly scenes on Monday of this week do not lead to that because I think it is vitally important that the Australian people have the right and freedom to have access to this Parliament House and their representatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, that is the other important and fundamental point; that our Parliament House is a symbol of the Australian way of life and our democratic process. Any assault on the Australian Parliament House is, in fact, an attack on our way of life and our democratic process. It is an attack on our freedoms and, as such, I am sure everybody would wish to condemn what occurred last Monday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst we are talking of symbols, can I say it was most disturbing to see a Young Labor flag hoisted upon the coat of arms outside the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2781"> front of this Parliament House. It really was a besmirching of the symbols of this great nation. The fact that protesters, especially of Young Labor, sought to hoist their flag and use the coat of arms for that purpose ought to be deeply regretted by all Australians. I trust that the Australian Labor Party, through their own processes, will be able to find out who was responsible for that and deal with it appropriately.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been somewhat interesting and at other times somewhat pitiful to observe how some are now running to dissociate themselves from the attack on Parliament House. On the other hand, some such as Bill Kelty tell us that the ACTU rally was a great success. I suppose he is right&mdash;it is just a question of definition: what is success? Do you measure it by the number of broken ribs, the number of bruises, the pints of blood that were spilt or the dollars worth of damages occasioned to the Parliament House? I suppose it really is simply a question of definition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To think that this same man, Bill Kelty, was the one who sat ex officio at Labor's cabinet table! He was the keen supporter of the former Prime Minister Paul Keating who allowed that man to become Prime Minister. No wonder Robert James Lee Hawke had no chance whatsoever when confronted with that sort of tactician.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Secretary of the ACT Trades and Labour Council, Jeremy Pyner, has taken some responsibility. I was pleased to read that in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>. It is to be regretted that it was not combined with an apology. The CFMEU tells us that they will not conduct a witch&hyphen;hunt amongst their members. I would have thought that was not necessary because every single Australian who watched the TV news on Monday night saw people with white t&hyphen;shirts and white windcheaters emblazoned with the red lettering of the CFMEU breaking down the doors of Parliament House. I would have thought it to be very easy for them to determine who those people are and take the appropriate action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If they fail to take action against people who were wearing their insignia on clothing&mdash;undoubtedly produced and handed out by the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> CFMEU&mdash;and fail to condemn them, they will be rightly accused of harbouring thugs and vandals. If the CFMEU wants to have any credibility in future industrial negotiations or with the Australian people they will need to be seen as responsible trade union citizens of this country. I urge the CFMEU, rather than trying to attack the police as they did and trying to blame the police for starting it, to take some action within their own ranks and expose those involved for the thuggery and damage occasioned on Monday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of the apologists for what occurred on Monday said, `Look, it was a good peaceful rally but things just somehow got out of hand. We are not sure how or why.' If that is the case I suppose we need to ask ourselves who addressed the rally and what type of language was employed at the rally. I remember when we were discussing the Racial Hatred Bill being lectured and hectored by those opposite in the Labor Party, talking about the need to deal with people who would seek to vilify and make people the object of hatred and who might incite violence as a result of outrageous comments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did the Labor Party's leader say at the rally? What did he tell the assembled throng? In full view of the TV cameras, so that it was broadcast into every household of this nation, he said, `The Liberal government that hates the workers, hates students, hates Aboriginals and hates women,'&mdash;one wonders who is left in the community when one goes through all that list. They were the words of hatred, incitement and vilification that those on the opposite side tried to lecture us about when we were previously discussing legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I simply say to the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, `You can't use language like that and then walk away from the consequences.' I think that Mr Beazley is basically a decent bloke. I think that in his heart of hearts he deeply regrets using those words last Monday. Nevertheless, he used them in public and in full view of all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have then got to ask: if that is your public behaviour then what would you be like in private when the TV cameras are not on you? When one is asking that question of the Leader of the Opposition one should more <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2782"> importantly ask the same question of those trade union officials who were battering down the front doors of Parliament House. If that is how they conduct themselves in full view of the TV cameras, can I ask the rhetorical question: how would they behave when negotiating with a small businessman without any other witness present? How would they deal with a worker on the factory floor behind the lockers with no other witness present if that is the sort of behaviour that they are willing to display in full view of the TV cameras of this nation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similar questions can unfortunately be asked&mdash;and I must say that it pains me to have to say this&mdash;of certain elements within the Aboriginal movement. There have been a number of allegations about what has been occurring within Aboriginal communities in Australia. I have heard that dissident Aboriginal groups&mdash;and they have spoken to me&mdash;do suffer substantially because they are not part of the mainstream culture of Aboriginal leadership and bureaucracy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would appear that this sort of thuggery is part of the culture for some people within the Australian Labor Party and it would be fair to say that some have come to live with it. The honourable member for Sydney, Mr Peter Baldwin, is a living example of that sort of behaviour. He still bears the scars of physical attacks for his views he held within the Australian Labor Party and for which he has suffered greatly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What occurred last Monday was nothing but an horrendous assault on the institutions of our democracy and an horrendous assault on our freedoms. It was most regrettable that when I went down to inspect some of the damage immediately after it occurred banners of the maritime workers, the health services union and the communications and postal union were all scattered on the floor. It was a very dark day in the history of the trade union movement of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I fully accept that people who have lived with a culture of compulsory trade unionism and are used to getting things their own way feel threatened by this government's move to try to free up our industrial relations system and give individual workers the right to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> choose whether or not they want to belong to a union. I have to say to my Labor colleagues on the other side of the chamber and the people of Australia, `Remember this&mdash;most Australians believe in a fair go.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister, Mr Howard, and the Liberal government have been in power for not even six months and they are trying to turn on a turn like this. Basically, the Australian people will be repulsed by what occurred. The trade union leadership did itself and its cause a great disservice. For pure political purposes and as a supporter of the government's industrial relations thrust, I suppose I can say that it was pleasing to see that it was so counterproductive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More important than the short&hyphen;term political gain that somebody sought to achieve from that demonstration is the potential damage that was done to the very institutions of this nation&mdash;and, in particular, I talk about the symbol of our parliamentary democracy, the symbol of freedom, which is this Parliament House&mdash;and the denigration and besmirching of our coat of arms for very cheap political purposes by some extreme elements within the young Labor movement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having seen some of the people who were affected by Monday's events and having seen the damage in the Parliament House gift shop and elsewhere, I felt moved to put on record my views and my feelings and to urge all Australians and all CFMEU and ACTU members to write to their trade union organisations and say, `Sure demonstrate, sure engage in freedom of speech, but when you organise rallies and things of this nature make sure that you run them in an appropriate way so that people do not come along with the sorts of things they came along with to this rally which would clearly indicate that some of the activities that were undertaken were in fact premeditated.' Just because the mood changes it does not mean that crowbars, battering rams or paint all of sudden materialise out of thin air. Those things do not just appear. They were there at the very beginning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me simply say that I hope that the events of 19 August 1996 will never be repeated and that the seriousness of what <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2783"> occurred on 19 August 1996 will be etched forever in the minds of the leadership of those movements that were involved in the demonstration and that they ensure that something of this nature never occurs again within Australian politics.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<TIME.STAMP>(1.00 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to draw the attention of the Senate to the final report of the Canberra Commission on the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons. The formal rejection today of the nuclear test ban treaty by the Indian government makes this issue very topical. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> About one year ago, we saw the largest mobilisation of Australians against nuclear weapons and their testing that we have really seen in a decade. Australians of all political persuasions marched together to send a message to the French and the Chinese governments that nuclear testing was not on as far as Australians are concerned and that, as peace loving people who care for our planet, we would not tolerate the threat that nuclear testing posed to nuclear non&hyphen;proliferation agreements, nor the threat it posed to the people and the environment where tests took place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor government criticised the testing in the strongest terms. We even took out advertisements in French newspapers. A group of parliamentarians from all political parties worked together to oppose the tests, and a group from this parliament and the state parliaments took our protest to Tahiti. Under the palm trees in Tahiti, Parliamentarians for a Nuclear Weapons Free World was formed as an organisation. The group declared itself to be:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A network of parliamentarians cooperating on a continuing basis as a network to exchange information and plan action including meeting from time to time to achieve a primary purpose of the cessation of all nuclear tests and the dismantling of all nuclear weapons.</PARA>
<PARA>The time has now come to take up the second and more difficult part of this challenge: the elimination of all nuclear weapons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most lasting and important initiative of the period of protest against French nuclear tests was the establishment of the Canberra <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Commission on the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons. The former Prime Minister, Paul Keating, and the then foreign affairs minister, Gareth Evans, should be congratulated for the role they took in initiating this high level international commission whose charter it was to come up with a practical and achievable plan for the total elimination of nuclear weapons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report of the Canberra Commission was presented to the Australian government last week. Prime Minister John Howard and his foreign affairs minister, Alexander Downer, must be congratulated for accepting the commission's report and agreeing to promote it in the international community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was privileged to attend an address by Maj Brit Theorin, one of the distinguished members of the Canberra Commission, to the Evatt Foundation in Sydney. Mrs Theorin is a member of the European Parliament; she served in the Swedish parliament for 24 years, and she is a former Swedish Ambassador for Disarmament in charge of Swedish disarmament policy. She is President of the International Peace Bureau and, as you know, Madam President, she is President of Parliamentarians for Global Action. She has held several important United Nations positions. Mrs Theorin was pleased to say that the Australian government will promote the report in the international community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report will be presented, as was intended by the Labor government, to the 51st Session of the General Assembly of the United Nations in September and to the Conference on Disarmament at the beginning of its 1997 session in January. The government has contacted the five nuclear weapons powers and, in total, will contact 30 countries directly to promote this report. The government has also undertaken to distribute the report to Australian embassies around the world. The full report of the Canberra Commission is available on the Canberra Commission website on the internet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the immediate threat of nuclear weapons testing now receded, the public perception of the danger of nuclear weapons has also receded. But the threat of nuclear weapons is as real today as it always was. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2784"> Thousands of nuclear weapons remain in the stockpiles around the world. These weapons are not just gathering dust, they remain on alert. They are ready to fire at any time. Each of these weapons has many times the destructive capabilities of the bombs that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki half a century ago. These weapons do not act as a deterrent; they endanger life on this planet. Nuclear weapons are too dangerous and too destructive to use in conventional warfare. They have not prevented wars in recent years, nor has the end of the Cold War reduced the threat of their use. The Canberra Commission report, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In some respects the risk of use by accident or miscalculation has increased. Political upheaval or the weakening of state authority in a nuclear weapon state could cripple existing systems for ensuring the safe handling and control of nuclear weapons and weapons material, increasing the odds of a calamity.</PARA>
<PARA>We have all read the horror stories of fissile material and nuclear technology being traded on the black market. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The possible acquisition of nuclear weapons or material is a growing threat to the international community. It adds a disturbing new dimension to the more well&hyphen;established concern about proliferation among states. During the Cold War, the most probable targets of nuclear attack were the nuclear weapon states themselves who targeted each others' military installations and even cities. Today the possible acquisition of nuclear weapons or material, including by terrorists and sub&hyphen;state groups, has become a serious threat to the international community.</PARA>
<PARA>The Canberra Commission report warns in particular of the consequences of the illegal trade in fissile material, particularly from sites in the former Soviet Union.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A recent Harvard study makes the point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It does not require a large step to get from terrorist acts like Oklahoma City and the World Trade Centre to the first act of nuclear terrorism. Suppose that instead of mini&hyphen;vans filled with hundreds of pounds of the crude explosive used in Oklahoma City and New York, terrorists had acquired a suitcase carrying one hundred pounds of highly enriched uranium, roughly the size of a grapefruit. Using a simple, well&hyphen;known design to build a weapon from this material, terrorists could have produced a nuclear blast equivalent to 10,000 to 20,000 tons of TNT. Under normal conditions, this would devastate a three-square&hyphen;mile urban area. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>There is also an increasing availability of the relevant expertise from scientists and technicians formerly employed in nuclear weapons establishments. Maj Britt Theorin proposes that these scientists should be employed to begin the process of safely dismantling nuclear weapons, rather than left on the scrap heap to sell their expertise to the highest bidder in their own countries, as they are in many cases, particularly in the former Soviet Union.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report of the Canberra Commission on the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons sets out a number of clear steps which can be taken immediately&mdash;today&mdash;to begin the process of elimination of nuclear weapons. The first step, of course, is an unequivocal commitment from the nuclear weapons states to the goal of a nuclear weapons free world and a commitment to start work immediately on the steps necessary to achieve that goal. These immediate steps include: taking nuclear forces off alert; removing warheads from delivery vehicles; ending deployment of non&hyphen;strategic nuclear weapons; ending nuclear testing; initiating negotiations to further reduce United States and Russian nuclear arsenals; and getting agreement among the nuclear weapon states of reciprocal `no first use' undertakings and of a `non&hyphen;use' undertaking by them in relation to non&hyphen;nuclear weapon states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reinforcing steps needed to ensure that all nuclear weapons are eliminated include: action to prevent further horizontal proliferation; developing verification arrangements for a nuclear weapons free world; and cessation of the production of fissile material for nuclear explosive purposes. Details of this process are included in the executive summary of the report and, accordingly, I seek leave to incorporate the executive summary into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The document read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Canberra Commission is persuaded that immediate and determined efforts need to be made to rid the world of nuclear weapons and the threat they pose to it. The destructiveness of nuclear weapons is immense. Any use would be catastrophic.  <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2785"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposition that nuclear weapons can be retained in perpetuity and never used&mdash;accidentally or by decision&mdash;defies credibility. The only complete defence is the elimination of nuclear weapons and assurance that they will never be produced again.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The end of the bipolar confrontation has not removed the danger of nuclear catastrophe. In some respects the risk of use by accident or miscalculation has increased. Political upheaval or the weakening of state authority in a nuclear weapon state could cripple existing systems for ensuring the safe handling and control of nuclear weapons and weapons material, increasing the odds of a calamity. The same fate could befall other states or sub-state groups with a less developed nuclear weapon capability or those that seek to develop such a capability in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nuclear weapons have long been understood to be too destructive and non&hyphen;discriminatory to secure discrete objectives on the battlefield. The destructiveness of nuclear weapons is so great that they have no military utility against a comparably equipped opponent, other than the belief that they deter that opponent from using nuclear weapons. Possession of nuclear weapons has not prevented wars, in various regions, which directly or indirectly involve the major powers. They were deemed unsuitable for use even when those powers suffered humiliating military setbacks.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No nuclear weapon state has been or is prepared to declare as a matter of national policy that it would respond to the use of chemical or biological weapons with nuclear weapons. The solution to these concerns lies in the strengthening and effective implementation of and universal adherence to the Chemical Weapons Convention and Biological Weapons Convention, with particular emphasis on early detection of untoward developments. The response to any violation should be a multilateral one.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thus, the only apparent military utility that remains for nuclear weapons is in deterring their use by others. That utility implies the continued existence of nuclear weapons. It would disappear completely if nuclear weapons were eliminated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A New Climate for Action</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nuclear weapons are held by a handful of states which insist that these weapons provide unique security benefits, and yet reserve uniquely to themselves the right to own them. This situation is highly discriminatory and thus unstable; it cannot be sustained. The possession of nuclear weapons by any state is a constant stimulus to other states to acquire them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the 1960s, the world looked at the prospect of dozens of nuclear weapons states, recoiled and rejected it. The result was the Treaty on the Non&hyphen; <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) of 1968 with its promise of a world free of these weapons. The overall success of the NPT and other nuclear non-proliferation regimes has been gratifying, but it has been hard won, and is by no means guaranteed. The prospects of a renewal of horizontal proliferation have become real.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proliferation of nuclear weapons is amongst the most immediate security challenges facing the international community. Despite the impact of the international nuclear non-proliferation regime, the disconcerting reality is that several states have made, and some continue to make, clandestine efforts to develop nuclear arsenals. The possible acquisition by terrorist groups of nuclear weapons or material is a growing threat to the international community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The end of the Cold War has created a new climate for international action to eliminate nuclear weapons, a new opportunity. It must be exploited quickly or it will be lost.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The elimination of nuclear weapons must be a global endeavour involving all states. The process followed must ensure that no state feels, at any stage, that further nuclear disarmament is a threat to its security. To this end nuclear weapon elimination should be conducted as a series of phased verified reductions that allow states to satisfy themselves, at each stage of the process, that further movement toward elimination can be made safely and securely.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Immediate Steps</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first requirement is for the five nuclear weapon states to commit themselves unequivocally to the elimination of nuclear weapons and agree to start work immediately on the practical steps and negotiations required for its achievement. This commitment should be made at the highest political level. Non-nuclear weapon states should support the commitment by the nuclear weapon states and join in cooperative international action to implement it. This commitment would change instantly the tenor of debate, the thrust of war planning, and the timing or indeed the necessity for modernisation programs. It would transform the nuclear weapons paradigm from the indefinite management of a world fraught with the twin risks of the use of nuclear weapons and further proliferation, to one of nuclear weapons elimination. Negotiation of the commitment should begin immediately, with the aim of first steps in its implementation being taken in 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The commitment by the nuclear weapon states to a nuclear weapon free world must be accompanied by a series of practical, realistic and mutually reinforcing steps. There are a number of such steps that can be taken immediately. They would significantly reduce the risk of nuclear war and thus <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2786"> enhance the security of all states, but particularly that of the nuclear weapon states. Their implementation would provide clear confirmation of the intent of the nuclear weapon states to further reduce the role of nuclear weapons in their security postures. The recommended steps are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Taking nuclear forces off alert</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Removal of warheads from delivery vehicles</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Ending deployment of non-strategic nuclear weapons</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Ending nuclear testing</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Initiating negotiations to further reduce United States and Russian nuclear arsenals</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Agreement amongst the nuclear weapon states of reciprocal no first use undertakings, and of a non-use undertaking by them in relation to the non-nuclear weapon states.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nuclear weapon states should take all nuclear forces off alert status and so reduce dramatically the chance of an accidental or unauthorised nuclear weapons launch. In the first instance, reductions in alert status could be adopted by the nuclear weapon states unilaterally.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The physical separation of warheads from delivery vehicles would strongly reinforce the gains achieved by taking nuclear forces off alert. This measure can be implemented to the extent that nuclear forces can be reconstituted to an alert posture only within known or agreed upon timeframes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The nuclear weapon states should unilaterally remove all non-strategic nuclear weapons from deployed sites to a limited number of secure storage facilities on their territory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pending universal application of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty all states should observe at once the moratorium it imposes on nuclear testing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The United States and Russia must continue to show leadership in reversing the nuclear accumulations of the Cold War. Their purpose should be to move toward nuclear force levels for all the nuclear weapon states which would reflect unambiguously the determination to eliminate these weapons when this step can be verified with adequate confidence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The nuclear weapon states should agree and state that they would not be the first to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against each other and that they would not use or threaten to use nuclear weapons in any conflict with a non-nuclear weapon state. Such an agreement should be brought into operation as soon as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reinforcing Steps</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The following steps would build on the solid foundation of commitment, accomplishment and goodwill established through implementation of the steps recommended for immediate action: <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Action to prevent further horizontal proliferation</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Developing verification arrangements for a nuclear weapon free world</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Cessation of the production of fissile material for nuclear explosive purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The problem of nuclear proliferation is inextricably linked to the continued possession of nuclear weapons by a handful of states. A world environment where proliferation is under control will facilitate the disarmament process and movement toward final elimination, and vice versa. The emergence of any new nuclear weapon state during the elimination process would seriously jeopardise the process of eliminating nuclear weapons. Action is needed to ensure effective non-proliferation controls on civil and military nuclear activities, and to press for universal acceptance of non-proliferation obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Effective verification is critical to the achievement and maintenance of a nuclear weapon free world. Before states agree to eliminate nuclear weapons they will require a high level of confidence that verification arrangements would detect promptly any attempt to cheat the disarmament process whether through retention or acquisition of clandestine weapons, weapons components, means of weapons production or undeclared stocks of fissile material. Formal legal undertakings should be accompanied by corresponding legal arrangements for verification. To maintain security in a post-nuclear weapon world the verification system must provide a high level of assurance as to the continued peaceful, non-explosive use of a state's nuclear activity. A political judgement will be needed on whether the levels of assurance possible from the verification regime are sufficient. All existing arms control and disarmament agreements have required political judgements of this nature because no verification system provides absolute certainty.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A key element of non-proliferation arrangements for a nuclear weapon free world will be a highly developed capacity to detect undeclared nuclear activity at both declared and undeclared sites. Progressive extension of safeguards to nuclear activity in the nuclear weapon states, the undeclared weapon states and the threshold states will be needed with the end point being universal application of safeguards in all states. Systems will be needed to verify that nuclear warheads are dismantled and destroyed, and their fissile material content safeguarded to provide maximum confidence that such material cannot be reintroduced to weapons use.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The political commitment to eliminate nuclear weapons must be matched by a willingness to make available the resources needed for nuclear disarmament including effective verification.

In this context, the Security Council should continue its consideration of how it might address, consistent with specific mandates given to it and consistent with the Charter of the United Nations, violations of nuclear disarmament obligations that might be drawn to its attention.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Future Environment</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nuclear weapon free zones are part of the architecture that can usefully encourage and support a nuclear weapon free world. The spread of nuclear weapon free zones around the globe, with specific mechanisms to answer the security concerns of each region, can progressively codify the transition to a world free of nuclear weapons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the level of national action, states have the fundamental obligation, under a variety of treaties, and in moral terms, to ensure that sensitive nuclear material, equipment and technology under their jurisdiction and control do not find their way into the hands of those who would misuse them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission noted with satisfaction the response of the International Court of Justice made in July 1996 to a request from the General Assembly of the United Nations for an advisory opinion on the legality of the threat or use of nuclear weapons. The Court's statement that there existed an obligation to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effec <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> tive international control is precisely the obligation that the Commission wishes to see implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission considered carefully the merits of setting out a precise timeframe for the elimination of nuclear weapons, but elected not to do so. However, this does not imply that it accepts the extended timelines imposed by such current constraints as limited warhead dismantlement facilities. Those constraints could be relieved by political decisions and the allocation of resources required to advance dismantlement. In addition, another limiting factor may prove to be establishing the necessary confidence in the verification regime which would be required to take the final step to complete elimination. In this context, the Canberra Commission remains convinced of the basic importance of agreed targets and guidelines which would drive the process inexorably toward the ultimate objective of final elimination, at the earliest possible time.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I conclude by saying that the report of the Canberra Commission is a cause for great optimism. The 17 members of the Commission are distinguished in their fields. They represent a number of different disciplines&mdash;they have scientific, military, diplomatic or political backgrounds. At least four of them were involved with the development of nuclear weapons or were responsible for a decision to use them&mdash;they literally had their fingers on the button. These leaders from around the world, brought together by an initiative of the Labor government, have said, `Yes it is possible, we can have a world free of the threat of nuclear holocaust.' Maj Britt Theorin told the Evatt Foundation meeting that, `It will happen during my grandchildren's lifetime, during my children's lifetime or even during my lifetime. It is absolutely possible to get rid of all nuclear weapons in my lifetime.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This optimism is heartening, but results come only through hard work. Governments must commit to the practical and achievable steps the Canberra Commission has mapped out. Our government, and other non&hyphen;nuclear powers, must pressure the nuclear states to comply. Those people who protested against the French nuclear tests, those 150,000 people in my own city, Sydney, who marched during the mid&hyphen;1980s&mdash;all of these people; all of us&mdash;must come together to promote action from our own government and from governments around the world.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2788">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Canberra Commission report does not set out a timetable for the elimination of nuclear weapons. Maj Britt Theorin made the point that total elimination could happen more quickly than any of us could imagine. The timetable is in the hands of the international community and peace activists, and we must keep up that pressure to ensure that, in our lifetimes, the madness of the nuclear arms race is completely eliminated.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I acknowledge, Senator Schacht, that sleep was at a premium if you followed it properly, although most of the events were between eight and 12 in the morning. I found the ABC radio coverage of this quite faultless. It was always up&hyphen;to&hyphen;date, it covered a wide range of sports, it featured in&hyphen;depth analysis and, whilst it catered to a degree for chauvinism that the Australian audience would expect, it also gave full acknowledgment to the sporting efforts by athletes around the world. Whether they came, as a 5,000&hyphen;metre runner did, from Burundi or whether it was Hong Kong winning its first gold medal at sailing, it was all covered on the ABC.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to pay tribute to a few of the individuals involved in the coverage. Tracey Holmes was the anchor person and did a splendid job. Most of us who are familiar with her performance on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sports Grandstand</EMPHASIS> on Saturdays and Sundays have come to expect high standards from her because she has helped turn that program into an absolute must, especially in summer. Her interviews are always in&hyphen;depth, she is articulate and a reasonable degree of humour is always injected into any of her interviews. She did very well. She was able to do well not because she is a person with or without natural ability but because she knows her sport&mdash;all sorts of sport&mdash;and she knows it back to front. She <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> was able to bring that experience to her anchoring of the ABC coverage of the Olympics and make it a really meaningful thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also thought Gerry Collins and Norman May did well in the swimming coverage. I know at times Norman May has attracted criticism. But now he has become a specialist commentator. He knew all the swimming form from around the world and was able to bring it to us and give us an excellent assessment of people's prospects in each race. Tim Lane did an excellent job at the athletics, covering a wide range of events. Of course, Tim Lane is also a versatile all&hyphen;rounder&mdash;an excellent football commentator, a very good cricket commentator; in fact, he can turn his hand to almost any sport. We also had Neville Oliver at the rowing&mdash;one of his specialities. Again, I found his descriptions&mdash;sometimes I listened to the radio while watching the event on television&mdash;enormously insightful and enormously accurate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also have to mention a Western Australian, George Grljusich, who covered the equestrian events. It should be noted that, in 1992, George Grljusich brought live to Australian audiences coverage of two gold medals that television missed. At the equestrian in 1992, George Grljusich not only described Matt Ryan winning an individual gold medal, but also described the Australian three&hyphen;day team winning the team medal at the same time. It is interesting that, even on the television broadcast an hour and a half later in 1992, the commentators had not really realised that Australia had won the team gold medal. But George Grljusich had calculated the odds and I will never forget his description&mdash;every time the leading New Zealander hit a rail, George was able to calculate how many more rails he had to hit to put Australia in a gold medal winning position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He starred again at Atlanta. On the second day, the day of the endurance event, the computers went down but George Grljusich was able to tell us over radio exactly where we stood in the teams event and how many penalties the three continuing riders had attracted. Gillian Rolton had fallen, although she still was willing to continue if necessary. George had calculated to two decimal points <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2789"> the penalties the three leading Australian riders had attracted and where they stood on the table, when everyone else seemed to have no idea at all. So George Grljusich at two Olympic Games has proved his depth on equestrian matters and has given an excellent coverage to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose we should also acknowledge that George Grljusich, with Benny Pike, attracted quite a cult following at the boxing. I cannot recall their actually ever describing a fight, but nevertheless they provided entertainment in abundance. In particular I can remember Benny Pike remonstrating with someone behind who had a ghetto&hyphen;blaster on. I have never heard anyone turn loud music off so quickly as when Benny had a word to him off microphone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to make a political point here, though. The reason the ABC has been able to give such a great coverage is that it has had the funds to do it and it has the widespread experience of describing sporting events. If the ABC funding is cut by $210 million over the next four years, and if the Mansfield inquiry recommends, as it is expected to, that the ABC cuts back on its radio sports coverage, Australia will never ever again be able to mount the sort of coverage that we saw at the Atlanta Olympics. And for the host nation, I think that would be a major tragedy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does not matter if in four years time the government throws $10 million, $15 million or 20 million dollars to the ABC and asks it to do the Olympics on radio. If you have lost all that expertise from your sporting departments around the country you will not be able to provide the necessary commentators to be able to make the sorts of accurate and considered descriptions of events that we have so far been so lucky to have. This point should be made in respect of maintaining funding to the ABC sports departments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is terribly fashionable to profess concern about symphony orchestras, and I am concerned about those, or to profess concern about the rotten current affairs programs the ABC often runs&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> last Monday night was a classic example of a distorted program. I have been a critic of the ABC over the years. But the fact is that no commercial <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> radio network or station could get near the standards and integrity of ABC sporting broadcast. We do not want to be elitist and just be concerned about the top end of the market. These are the bread&hyphen;and&hyphen;butter programs of the ABC that a majority of Australians like. It is not to say, in pushing that line, that we should ignore the minority groups who have other tastes in Australia, which the ABC also adequately caters for. But make no mistake, if the funding cuts go ahead, sport and sports broadcasting will be the first victim and, as such, its value will be greatly diminished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I am on my feet, I might make some comments on the Channel 7 coverage of the Atlantic Olympics. I found their performance at Atlanta a vast improvement on that at Barcelona. Some of the lessons learnt at Barcelona were applied very well in Channel 7's coverage. Everyone complained about Channel 7's coverage because they ran commercials. Frankly, that just goes with the territory. If you have to spend multiple tens of millions of dollars to win the rights to Olympics, you must expect that there will be adverts coming on and off during the time. But they were able, on this occasion, to get a lot more events live to air and had a lot more flexibility switching between venues than they showed at Barcelona.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was also a greater acknowledgment by Channel 7&mdash;not complete; they were not perfect&mdash;that some events were off tape and not live to air. But I think they actually carried every Australian gold medal winning performance live to air. They carried every Olympic swimming final. They also carried a majority of the athletics finals, apart from maybe on the last day when the Australian basketball match was being played contemporaneously with those athletics events. They also managed to give an excellent coverage to the men's marathon and, I have to say, in terms of critique, an inadequate coverage of the women's marathon event. But on the whole, I think Channel 7 showed that they were an improving broadcaster of the Olympics. Let me pay tribute to some of those who covered it.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2790">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bruce McAvaney's coverage of the athletics was absolutely superb. There have been many accolades delivered to Bruce McAvaney over the years. He does know his athletics probably better than any other commentator in the world. He knows where all the key individuals come from. He has that nice blend of Australian patriotism and an acknowledgment of superior efforts by athletes from around the globe. He brought much to that commentary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was interesting also that Channel 7 was able to get interviews with the key athletes within three or four minutes of the events concluding&mdash;the Michael Johnsons and all the rest of them. A lot of it, I think, was due to Bruce McAvaney's reputation. Bruce McAvaney has been probably the best sports broadcaster in Australia in the last couple of decades, and certainly the best athletics broadcaster. The only tragedy was that these responsibilities probably deprived him of anchoring a lot of the sports coverage that we all would have benefited from.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must also pay tribute to Denis Commeti for his very accurate calling of events in the swimming pool. He also had a realistic blend of analysis as to Australia's prospects and was assisted ably by Neil Brooks. Peter Landy, who is not necessarily my favourite broadcaster for football reasons, brought great credit to himself in respect of one area in which he has expertise, and that is his description of rowing events. He knows it back to front. He was very good at picking where the Australians were in the field, their chances of improvement or whether they would drop off the place. Peter Landy did an excellent job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also commend Sandy Roberts for his efforts. He was thrown in at the deep end in several sports, and again showed the sort of experience that enabled him to cover them competently. Pat Welch did very well on the track.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that one of the things that bind these sporting broadcasts together is the anchor person. Most of these did very well. If I have one criticism of the Channel 7 performance, it was the anchor person between midnight and 2 a.m., although I must concede that counting up the mistakes she made did keep me awake. You usually got to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 15, 20, 25 bloopers, inanities or misread cue cards in that two hours. Whilst I am not a great fan of David Fordham, wasn't I relieved every night when he came on at 2 a.m.! The classic point here is that there is no use putting a newsreader who can just read cue cards into a position where you are switching from venue to venue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know if you, Madam Acting Deputy President, know that she got totally wrong the names of the two great female rowers who won on the first night. She acknowledged that two different rowers had won the gold medal! Channel 7 needs to make sure that commentators with sports backgrounds anchor these events. This will relieve the sorts of absolutely elementary blunders that we saw in that particular coverage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the whole, I think Channel 7 has improved its coverage of the Olympics. The ratings show that they got outstanding ratings right throughout the Olympic Games, and I hope that when they go on to cover Sydney they will improve yet again. They face challenges in Sydney where we will have teams in every team event, which we normally do not do. They are going to have to give a lot of consideration&mdash;I know my colleague Senator Schacht has been thinking about this too&mdash;to how they will be able to get enough events live to air. It may well be that some arrangement will have to be made to try to maximise that. Sports such as women's soccer and men's volleyball deserve some airplay during the Sydney Olympics. But quite clearly they are going to have to prioritise and give concentration to the athletics track, the swimming pool and the velodrome, where the majority of peak audiences will be. But that challenge is in front of them. If Channel 7 continue to improve at the rate they have since Barcelona through to Atlanta, we are in for a real treat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to conclude my comments by reiterating how good the ABC radio coverage of the Olympics was and the fact that that has now been put in jeopardy by the funding arrangements that this government has put in place. It will be an easy mark for those highbrow people who tend to run the ABC <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2791"> and who will say, `Let's get rid of the sporting coverage.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can tell you now that there will be a rebellion all round Australia, not only in cities, but in regional areas that rely on the ABC for such a component of the broadcasting service. When you think of the ABC you cannot but think of their test cricket coverage, their Sheffield Shield coverage, their range of coverage from women's netball right through to all the sports that deserve at least some mention and coverage. I hope that when Mr Mansfield does his review of the ABC charter, he does not take the weak road and simply recommend that most of these sporting programs be butchered.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure Mr George Grljusich will appreciate Senator Ray's comments about him, and I will make sure that they get to him. I wonder whether Senator Ray has ever heard George making commentary on the games between Collingwood and the Eagles. Even when the Eagles are losing, George can make it sound as if the Eagles are winning, particularly if Peter Sumich is in the team. I think that there is some distant relationship there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> But as I raise the matter of Western Australia and Mr George Grljusich, I want to bring the Senate back to my home state of Western Australia and, in fact, to my home city of Wanneroo. Many people around Australia will have heard about Wanneroo, particularly in recent years, because of the corruption that has been to the forefront, unfortunately, among some councillors within the City of Wanneroo.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is now currently a royal commission of inquiry into the city of Wanneroo, and I want to address the manner in which the Western Australian government has handled the allegations of corruption in the Wanneroo council. It is causing deep concern about the administration of justice in my home state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Former Wanneroo councillor David King was convicted and gaoled in 1994 for taking bribes. Following his trial, he tried to blow the whistle on the widespread corruption that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> had existed for years within the council. Since that time, what have we seen? Have we seen a government dealing with these serious allegations? Have we seen them being dealt with in a manner which shows that the government is committed to eliminating corruption? Unfortunately not. We have seen an attempt at whitewash and cover&hyphen;up. The Western Australian government had to be dragged by public pressure into re&hyphen;establishing the former government's Cahill inquiry into the Wanneroo City Council. Then it had to be further dragged kicking and screaming into setting up the royal commission which is currently on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what then? The honest people back in Perth and in Western Australia would have hoped that the rottenness that is there amongst some people within Wanneroo would have been finally opened up and, therefore, eradicated. But this has not happened. Why not? Because the corruption that is endemic there among the leading individuals in Wanneroo goes right to the heart of the Liberal Party. King detailed all this in the statement he made to the justice ministry and to the Director of Public Prosecutions in late 1994. The statement was forwarded to the Western Australian police force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Should King have been listened to? Indeed, he was listened to, at least by the courts. He had convinced the jury that the former Wanneroo mayor, Wayne Bradshaw, was corrupt. Bradshaw is now in prison. King's statement had convinced the magistrate that another local developer, Ted Hodgkinson, has a case to answer on bribery charges. Hodgkinson is currently awaiting trial. So what has happened with all these allegations? We really do not know because the police department in Western Australia has wound up the investigations with 17 lines of inquiry apparently still left open. Why did it do that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why did Peter Kyle, who ran the early stages of an independent inquiry into Wanneroo, say that the police in Western Australia are soft on pursuing corruption against politicians? Why did he say that some of the same police officers alleged to be involved in the Argyle Diamonds affairs were also involved in Wanneroo? It would have to come as no <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2792"> surprise to Mr Kyle that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper reported yesterday, Tuesday, 20 August, that seven senior police officers are to be disciplined over adverse findings in the Australian Federal Police inquiry and report into the Argyle Diamonds case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honest people of Western Australia would hope that the current royal commission would answer some of these questions. Has that happened? Indeed, it has not. What has happened instead is that King and the other whistleblowers, such as the former Director&hyphen;General of the Ministry of Justice, David Grant, and his officers, have been viciously attacked by the royal commission for involving themselves in this. This has been done using some of the very police officers, including Deputy Police Commissioner Les Ayton&mdash;who retires later this week&mdash;and his internal affairs unit which are the subject of disciplinary action. The Ministry of Justice officers are also facing charges laid by Grant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Counsel Assisting the Royal Commission, Ms Narelle Johnson, has been strongly critical of the role of the justice ministry's intelligence unit even being involved at all in gathering this information from King, who was then being held in prison by the ministry, and passing it on to the Director&hyphen;General and then to the Director of Public Prosecutions. She described that as information gathering `at large' and dangerous. Her attack has serious implications for the fight against crime and corruption not only in Western Australia but generally throughout Australia, because all law enforcement agencies, at both federal and state levels, depend upon this type of information flow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">King in particular was subjected to what a Queen's Counsel has described as forensic axe&hyphen;work. The result is not only that doubts have been thrown over King's broad allegations but that the mates of the Liberal Party, Bradshaw and Hodgkinson included, who are waiting for their appeal and trial, suddenly find that the main witness against their particular matters has been discredited. In the Queen's Counsel's opinion the royal commission was in contempt of court in doing this and the royal commissioner, who intentionally allowed this to happen, should immediately <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> resign. This has been put to the Western Australian Attorney&hyphen;General, Mr Peter Foss, but he has refused to act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And what has the royal commission done about the police investigations into Wanneroo which have been prematurely wound up? Nothing. It has conveniently decided that looking at the police investigations into Wanneroo is outside its terms of reference. Kyle predicted this when Roger Davis replaced him as chairman of the inquiry. The result was that Police Commissioner Falconer was not even asked when giving evidence why the investigation was wound up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The royal commissioner made one exception in his ruling about police investigations. He allowed the examination in detail of the investigation of former police officer Wayde Smith. The not so surprising result was that counsel assisting says that Mrs Cheryl Edwardes, former Attorney&hyphen;General and current Minister for Family and Children's Services, has been greatly maligned by the suggestions that she had been heard on tape discussing a bribe. And how did she come to that conclusion? Because the police officer in charge of the investigation, Detective McLeod, said so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the head of the internal affairs unit recently criticised by the Chairman of the Western Australian Legislative Council Committee into the Police Force as being a failure in fighting corruption and more interested in concealing corruption than exposing it. It is the officers from this unit, along with the Deputy Police Commissioner, who are being disciplined over Argyle Diamonds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the same officer who admitted in evidence that he had actively campaigned for Mrs Edwardes before the previous election. He also admitted that he had erased all the tapes and all the transcripts of the tapes, even though the Kyle inquiry had been re&hyphen;established. Even the counsel assisting, who had carried out the attack on King, was forced to concede that that had been both `odd' and `unwise', but she said that she did not want to read anything into it more than that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there is more that is of concern in the police approach to Wanneroo. McLeod told the commission that he had been informed by <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2793"> former Wanneroo Councillor Sybil Roberts that she had been visited by uniformed police warning her to stop giving Bradshaw trouble. By his own admission, McLeod made no efforts of his own to follow this up, even though it was the exact role of his unit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He also told the commission that the Police Bureau of Criminal Intelligence had been informed of an association between Bradshaw and convicted drug runner Allan Harriman. What had been done about this, or about contacts between Bradshaw and well&hyphen;known criminal identity John Kizon? The royal commission has decided not to require Harriman to give evidence because his information is outside the terms of reference. Sounds familiar?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there are other serious concerns being raised about the process of the royal commission. The Queen's Counsel's opinion has claimed that the commission is operating in an apparently biased way, saying that a reasonable member of the public could think it is being conducted as a `whitewash'. It is doing this by its aggressive discrediting of whistleblower David King. It is doing this by characterising the Ministry of Justice criminal intelligence gathering role in a way which will prevent the pursuit of corruption. It is doing this by the acceptance of the evidence of politically aligned and disciplined police officers like Ayton and McLeod and by accepting the evidence of those in the ministry whose mates have been charged with criminal offences or who are facing disciplinary offences themselves, against the whistleblowers who laid the charges. It has been done by `artificial' and `unreal' interpretation of the evidence presented, in the opinion of the Queen's Counsel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honest and fair people of Western Australia must be concerned&mdash;and, indeed, are very concerned&mdash;about this. We have a state government which has resisted investigating Wanneroo council as long as it could, because it knew that not only its mates but also its politicians were involved. We have senior police officers, some of whom are being disciplined themselves, who are politically connected to the government and who are carrying out the first stage of investigations <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and then destroying the evidence after another inquiry has been set up, which then winds up the second stage when investigating officers still have 17 lines of inquiry remaining open.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we have an apparently biased royal commission which is shooting the whistleblowers, and in a way that helps the government's mates in their upcoming court cases. In doing this it is in contempt of court, but nothing is done about it. It is a whitewash, pure and simple, and the whistleblowers are being shot to achieve it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it is not only the Western Australian government whose motives should be examined here. The federal government also has questions to answer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In June of this year, the former Director&hyphen;General of the Ministry of Justice, David Grant, approached the federal Attorney&hyphen;General's Department with his concerns about the lack of action by the Western Australian authorities regarding Wanneroo. He was told that these were not federal issues, except for one matter. This was raised with Attorney&hyphen;General Williams who referred it to the Australian Securities Commission. Their response was that it was too long ago and that the information was too vague, `but if there is some political pressure there might be some action'. Nothing has happened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where does this government stand on corruption? Is it going to do something about it or will it just protect its mates in the west? Whichever way you look at this entire Wanneroo saga, it is clear that there has been massive corruption and that corruption is being covered up to protect the interests of Richard Court and his government as it comes up to an election early next year. Now it seems the Howard government may be playing a role in this, and it is the whistleblowers and the honest people of Western Australia who want a decent system of justice who are suffering.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

But when the rest of the world is willing to compete with each other on the sporting field, and get the joy, the success and the pride in their own country's performance that come from it, one can say, `It is much better for people to compete on the sporting field than as in past centuries when often they would be competing on the battlefield for national glory.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I noticed, a week or so after the Olympic Games had concluded, the SBS, on a Sunday morning, ran programs from Poland, Italy and Greece. Each of those programs did a summary of the achievements of their own sports people and what they had achieved at the Olympic Games. It was covered with exactly the same level of pride as that of Australians who watched and heard our athletes perform. Once again, it shows the enormous positive power the Olympics has as a pre&hyphen;eminent international event.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like Senator Ray, I believe there will be a threat to the ABC's future as a broad based national broadcaster if the government goes through with these dreadful funding cuts, which will be $210 million over the next four years. If it is true that a thousand people will be retrenched from the ABC, I understand that the ABC will have to borrow the redundancy money from the Department of Finance and then repay it over the next couple of years. I am told that those thousand redundancy packages could approach $50 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That would have to go on top of the $210 million to be cut so we might be looking at a $250 million cut to the ABC's funding over the next four years. There is no doubt that that would wreck the structure of the ABC. It would mean that the institutional experience and skill of all of those people who were mentioned by Senator Ray in being able to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> give such an excellent coverage would, in large measure, disappear. That is one reason why I call on all Australians, no matter where they live, no matter which party they support or belong to, to put a submission to the Mansfield inquiry&mdash;people have until the end of this month to put in a submission&mdash;demanding that the broad charter of the ABC be left untouched so that the excellent coverage that was achieved in Atlanta by ABC radio staff can be available in an even bigger and better way for Australia's great moment when we have the Sydney Olympics in the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, I endorse the remarks made by Senator Ray that Channel 7's coverage was a considerable improvement on Barcelona. Senator Ray touched on the issue that, because of the scope of the Olympic Games and the large number of individual sports, it is almost impossible for one channel to provide live coverage of every event. Events are held each day, many of them simultaneously at different venues around the Olympic site. But, nevertheless, there was an improvement by Channel 7 and we got better coverage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think in the case of some of their commentators&mdash;some of whom were selected because of their reputation in the media generally, but not in sports&mdash;they stumbled a bit trying to explain the technicalities of some of the sports that they were covering. I think Channel 7 has to have a further look at making sure that the person commentating, even on delayed broadcast, knows the rules of the sport being covered, knows the intricacies of it and the background to it. With some of the team sports that are now being covered, the rules are quite technical. Because the sport may not be well known in Australia, we need a specialist who understands it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The major issue I wish to raise for Channel 7 for its coverage of the Sydney Olympics is that of team sports. As Senator Ray said, because we are the host country, we have automatic entry to every team sport in the Olympic games, even team sports such as handball, which got very little coverage because there is very little interest or participation in it in Australia. We can also enter men's and women's soccer, men's and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2795"> women's volleyball, men's and women's beach volleyball, women's softball, men's and women's hockey. There are also, of course, men's and women's tennis. Australia will automatically enter all of those sports without having to go through qualification. No matter how Channel 7 tries to juggle it, I suspect it will find it very difficult to give coverage to all of those sports, even when we are playing for a gold medal or a medal of some sort, let alone all those we participate in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think Channel 7 is going to have to look at negotiating appropriately and it should make arrangements for some of these team sports to be covered by another station. For example, I am sure it could reach an agreement that men's and women's soccer could be covered by SBS.</PARA>

All I can say, Senator, is that there will always be someone missing out if you only have one station, and maybe there is a chance that Channel 7 ought to have a look at making some of those arrangements. For example, I would draw your attention, Senator Wood, to the fact that in the men's soccer tournament, Nigeria beat Brazil in an absolutely pulsating, exciting match that was world class.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There will probably be some people Senator Wood, who would <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> say, `We have an interest in synchronised swimming. We want to watch it.' You may not have that taste. I may not have that taste. But that is the problem. So I think that is an area where there are some issues that Channel 7, as the host broadcaster for the Olympic Games, which is covering it for all Australians because of the extreme interest, is obviously going to have to discuss with the Olympic Committee. I hope it can do that sensibly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that I hope we do not have a repeat of the arguments about other television stations getting news coverage and being able to interview athletes. Without apportioning blame on this, I really think the arguments between networks over whether people should be able to be interviewed on other networks, and so on, ought to be able to be resolved amicably between all networks, particularly for the Sydney Olympic Games.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Others have made the point, and I make it too, that the Australian athletes at the Sydney Olympics will be funded overwhelmingly through programs supported by Australian taxpayers. There is a community interest there for news services, and so on, that ought to be looked at, and that issue has to be amicably settled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Overall, I think Channel 7 has an enormous task ahead of it. I am sure they will be able to meet that challenge. But I think they could look at a couple of these ideas that I and Senator Ray have raised about further improvement, particularly how to cover all the team sports at the same time, which I think will be very difficult. They should also look at how to cover those major team sports even when Australia is not participating as there will be people wanting to see adequate coverage of that top quality sport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will also say in conclusion that the real issue here is that we have this threat to the future structure of the ABC&mdash;the cuts to the ABC&mdash;which could really affect the radio broadcast it will give of the Sydney Olympics. That is why the Labor Party in opposition will strongly oppose the cuts to the ABC that the government has outlined in the last few weeks.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did the Labor Party government do to Australian families? It is worth remembering, in fact, that the real average weekly earnings <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of families under Labor&mdash;and this is apart from those suffering from unemployment of whom there were many&mdash;fell, and they fell in an inequitable way as well. Lower income earners, Senator Carr, in whom I thought you would be interested, under Labor actually suffered more, disproportionately more. Home loan repayments for Australian families under Labor rose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australian families were worse off under Labor. That was the point. They suffered from the consequences of the recession that we did not have to have, the Labor Party induced recession. But they suffered beyond the recession as well. It is for that reason that we said before the last election that we would deliver benefits to Australian families, particularly to lower to middle level Australian families. I am pleased that we have been able to deliver that promise in full, notwithstanding the fact that we also have had to face up to a deficit of somewhere between $8,000 million and $10,000 million, which we had been assured by Labor&mdash;this Labor Party that claims to tell the truth&mdash;did not exist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We announced last night, in contrast to Labor's failure, our family tax initiative which will direct an additional $1 billion a year to almost two million Australian families with children. These initiatives will provide families with a greater array of choices and genuine opportunities. They recognise the contribution of families as integral to maintaining a strong, cohesive and compassionate society&mdash;something that the Labor Party would not understand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The majority of Australian families with dependent children will benefit. They will receive a $1,000 increase in their tax&hyphen;free threshold for each dependent child. One&hyphen;income families will receive a further $2,500 increase in their tax&hyphen;free threshold if they have a child under five. This is an excellent initiative that this new Howard government has been able to deliver, notwithstanding the difficult economic circumstances that we have inherited. It is not surprising that it is already being applauded by Australian families who finally have a government that understands their needs and is prepared to deliver the benefits to which they are entitled.</PARA>

How will the changes to HECS redress the inequity which forces lower income families to subsidise, through the tax system, a university population which is overrepresented by children from higher income families?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="2801" SPEAKER="Vanstone, Sen Amanda" NAMEID="7E4" ELECTORATE="SA" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator O'Chee for that question. It is important to recognise that the HECS system introduced by Labor is, in fact, an acknowledgment of the dual benefits of higher education. There is already substantial public benefit, and there is a private benefit at the same time. Labor recognised that when it introduced the HECS system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To maintain equity, however, students do not need to pay any money back at all until they start earning an income. So the payment back comes when you start getting the benefit of the higher education that you have received. That is a very important equity and access point of the HECS system which we are retaining. We think Labor did the right thing when it introduced HECS. It acknowledged the private benefit that students get, asked them to make a contribution on that basis and did not ask them to pay it back until they started earning an income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to recognise that Labor's actual record on equity and access in higher education is not really that good. The expansion in participation in higher education since 1989 is not in itself proof of increased equity. It might be a larger system, but it is not necessarily a more equitable one. It is very important to understand that survey data tells us that households with the top 20 per cent of incomes enjoy 38 per cent of the benefits of higher education. So the top 20 per cent get 38 per cent of higher education. These households have an average income of $84,000. They get the big slice of the cake.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> By contrast, the bottom 20 per cent of households, with an average income of $7,800 a year, enjoy only seven per cent of the benefit of higher education. In other words, higher education remains largely a middle&hyphen;class preserve. The very real key to improved access for lower economic backgrounds comes from increasing opportunities in pri mary and secondary schools and getting those students more prepared for higher education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the 10 years before Labor realised that higher education could not be funded by the taxpayer alone, the years of the so-called free education&mdash;and we know it is not free; someone else pays&mdash;the higher education participation rate of year 12 graduates from the wealthiest 25 per cent actually went up from 55 per cent to 59 per cent.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, Senator Harradine, I believe I can. It is important to remember that Austudy is not a tax benefit to families. There is a different purpose in Austudy than a tax benefit to families. Austudy is both an income supplement and an educational incentive. It is quite unique in that respect. It is a combination of those things. Similarly, you would expect there to be differences between Austudy, perhaps, and unemployment rates.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Hill), to questions without notice asked by Senator Faulkner this day, relating to the Budget and election promises.</PARA>
<PARA>The message of this budget is: do not be old; do not be good at school; do not be sick; do not be black; if you are unemployed, too bad; and if you are young and unemployed, forget it. We have a budget littered with deceit, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> betrayal and broken promises. By destroying the ABC, Mr Howard has saved each taxpayer $4 a year. By assaulting and injuring higher education in this country, and with it, of course, Australia's future in the world, he has saved each and every Australian taxpayer $50 a year. By destroying Aboriginal culture and hope in this country, he has saved taxpayers $9 a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that these are the actions of a Prime Minister who has no ideas, who does not have a clue about the consequences of his actions and who has a very long hate list. This budget is a betrayal. Mr Howard has broken cast&hyphen;iron pledge after cast&hyphen;iron pledge. He has broken pledges on HECS, he has broken pledges to the young people of this country and he has broken pledges to families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that this budget is nothing more or less than a political swindle. John Howard has swindled the poor and needy in Australia. He has swindled the frail and elderly and left them to the care of a minister, the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman), who does not understand the fundamental issues involved in the administration of aged care and her own portfolio. It is this government that has left the frail and elderly to have to find up&hyphen;front fees for nursing homes and pay for home and community care services.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe that we have both a surplus now and expect that surplus to improve, as our figures indicate, over the next three or four years. We're anticipating moving into structural surplus.</PARA>
<PARA>This, Mr Deputy President, was the basis on which we did our figures. Were we entitled to rely on what the Labor finance minister of this country assured us? I would have thought we were, reinforced by ministers in the Senate, particularly, I recall, Senator Cook&mdash;`The budget will be in surplus.' So the figures were done on that basis. Yet we get into government and the day after we are told by Treasury, `I'm sorry, it is actually $8,000 million in deficit.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do you believe for one minute that Minister Beazley did not know the true situation? He was the finance minister of this country. He was asked in the election to open the books and he refused. The Prime Minister, Mr Keating, was asked in the election to open the books and he refused. We were given these <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> figures to work on and our promises, accurately costed, were based on those figures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite having to face up to that unexpected $8,000 million deficit and largely remedy it in the course of the next couple of budgets, we will get to surplus during the course of this parliament&mdash;an historic achievement. Despite that, we were also able in this budget to honour so many of those critically important promises that we made: promises to families; promises on health care; promises to the elderly, self&hyphen;funded retirees; promises to small business on rollover of capital gains, for example; promises of more funding to the CSIRO; promises for more research in the universities; and promises for more APA scholarships in the universities.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the very serious issue of broken promises of Mr Howard and Mr Costello. I want to read again to the Senate the commitment that the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, gave before the election in the context of whatever the budget deficit would be after the election. When Mr Howard was asked what he would be doing if we was confronted with the choice between breaking election promises and running a budget deficit, he said, `Oh, look, I've made it clear. I'm not going to break any promises.' This assurance was given by the Prime Minister before the election in the context of being asked what he would do if the budget deficit was bigger once he won the election, if he won that election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Howard and Mr Costello have clearly deceived the Australian people. In future, when anyone asks the Prime Minister or Mr Costello, `What is your commitment? What is your promise?', they will have to make sure they ask, `Is it a non&hyphen;core commitment or is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> it a core commitment?' Because since the election all we have had is a backtrack on promises and commitments by covering it up by saying, `We've got core promises and non&hyphen;core promises.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we challenged the opposition today to give us an example of a non&hyphen;core promise, all they could talk about was core promises but they could not give one example of a non&hyphen;core promise.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to go through a number of the promises, some of which were announced before the budget was handed down last night. What about the ABC? We all recall the commitment given to maintain ABC funding. We all recall Senator Alston's declaration on election night; we all recall him giving assurances after the Liberal Party was elected that ABC funding would be maintained and we all recall that dreadful performance on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> three or four weeks ago when Senator Alston maintained that the promise that was given could be expected to last only until the budget; that is, it was a five&hyphen;month, non&hyphen;core promise. That was what the promise to maintain funding to the ABC was all about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about the arts? They said they would maintain arts spending and provide an additional $60 million over three years. What happened to the Australia Council? Funding was cut by $16 million over four years. I see Senator Boswell looking a little intrigued. He spent the last six months defending a core promise to ensure that the diesel fuel rebate was not cut back. Senator Boswell, you spent the last six months defending a clear commitment. You may have saved it, but how does it deliver one additional dollar to people in the bush? Have a look at the budget papers and that core promise you got&mdash;$200 million over four years off the diesel fuel rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will be interested to see how you defend the change to the diesel fuel rebate when we get details in this Senate of that cutback and how hard you fight to protect people in the bush.

You have talked a lot about the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  editorial. The opening paragraph of an article by John Short in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Government embarked last night on a high&hyphen;risk political strategy with a Budget that pays for its election commitments to families and small <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> business by hitting the aged, the sick, students and the unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what it says. You cannot pick and choose all the time. This is one article that I remember reading and thought fairly summarised the political architecture of this budget. It is cleverly crafted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point will be what Australians feel further down the track when they understand what they have got from the family tax package and what they have got from the health insurance rebates but also what they have to pay in increased charges across the board. For example, in the past if you wanted to use the family law court's counselling system you did not have to pay anything and now you have to pay $40 a session. For some people that will be an impost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As you look through the detail of this budget you can find good things and you can find lots of bad things and quite a lot of surprising mean things like deeming on small bank accounts of pensioners and social security beneficiaries. However, I do not want to go into the broken promises. We have heard what they are. I agree that the l&hyphen;a&hyphen;w tax cuts involved an appalling broken promise that has passed into history in that form.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it was time for a charter of budget honesty. I hope the coalition brings that forward as the first piece of budget legislation. I am mindful of today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> poll which asked this question: if you knew on election day what you now know about the coalition's plans, would you have voted for the coalition?

I indicated in the Senate on 27 June that the government would cooperate to the maximum extent possible with this order, consistent with our executive obligations. Such an approach is consistent with the government's strong commitment to open and accountable government. It is in this spirit that I table a large number of documents today.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I indicated on 27 June, the Department of Finance has written to every individual and organisation that made submissions to the commission, requesting their consent to make the submissions public.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating today, and we have been debating consistently since question time and the handing down of the budget last night, the enormous betrayal by this newly elected government of the Australian people as indicated by its massive and wilful breaking of election promises in this year's budget. I would like to draw the attention of the Senate to the guarantee that the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, gave before the last election. He gave a number of these guarantees during the election campaign, and a number of them have been broken. But in respect of election promises and the budget he made it very clear that, if in office he was confronted with a choice between breaking election promises and running a budget <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2818"> deficit, he would not break any promises.

This is what Australians have to ask and what anyone who has any dealings with Mr Howard and the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in future has to ask when they are discussing an issue and reaching an agreement with Mr Howard and Mr Costello: `You've made a commitment; you've made a promise; but is it a core promise or is it a non-core promise?' Since the election we have had the emergence of two categories of promises: the promises you keep, the core promises; and the promises that you ditch, the non-core promises. There are core promises and non-core promises from a non-core Prime Minister, I might say, a non-core Treasurer and a non-core Liberal Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for the National Party, they did not even rate in the core promises. They spent all their time fighting the commitment on the diesel fuel rebate and were not able to deliver any dollars to the bush&mdash;not one single dollar. It is about time the National Party stopped being the doormat. I see Senator McGauran here. I say to Senator McGauran, through you, Mr Deputy President: I hope you are listening to people out in the bush in regional Australia, because a lot of people in the rural and regional sector are concerned at the way the National Party has rolled over at the breaking of promises by the Liberal Party and are concerned at the way the Liberal Party has captured the National Party and treated them as a doormat.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has worked, Senator McGauran. I would like to refer again to a number of the specific promises that we raised in question time today and also some that, unfortunately, we did not have the time to ask Senator Short or Senator Hill about. Even if we had asked them, frankly, on today's performance we would not have received an answer, because they obfuscated and dodged the issues, particularly Senator Short&mdash;although Senator Newman could not even address the answer to a question because she did not even know what HACC funding was. That is how poorly she is across her portfolio area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Today in question time we asked quite specifically about a range of issues that went to ironclad commitments. I remember thr Prime Minister, Mr Howard, saying right through the election campaign period that he wanted to restore honesty and integrity to Australian politics. He gave ironclad commitments. I remember the commitment he gave on industrial relations policy. He gave an absolute guarantee that not one Australian worker would be worse off&mdash;that is a debate we will have at another time&mdash;but the evidence is to the contrary. This Prime Minister, together with Mr Costello, has deceived the Australian people about the formulation of this budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some members of the government took great joy in quoting newspaper articles&mdash;I do not think they had read the budget, but they seemed to take great joy in quoting newspaper headlines and editorials. I think they had better have a longer look at the detail in the budget, because there are a lot of nasties there. A lot of those nasties break very firm election commitments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A few of them I referred to in a question to Senator Short today. Why are hospital funding grants cut by $314 million? The Liberal Party gave a commitment that that would not be cut. That is a betrayal. It is a betrayal of the sick people in our community, particularly those who do not have private health insurance. It is a betrayal particularly of those in rural and regional areas, as Senator McGauran will find out as he continues to get the complaints about waiting lists, et cetera.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2819">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about the poor, the sick and the elderly who have to pay an extra $500 million on pharmaceuticals? Where was that in the Liberal Party's election manifesto? What about the abolition of the Commonwealth dental health program? It was fascinating to see Senator Hill say on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> last night, `We have handed the dental health program back to the states.' Where is the funding?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Gibson is from my home state of Tasmania. The state Liberal Premier of Tasmania has already bucketed Senator Gibson and his colleagues for not standing up for Tasmania. I am certainly very confident that the Premier of Tasmania, Mr Rundle, will be telling the parliamentary secretary, Senator Gibson, that they do not have the money to run the Commonwealth dental health program. That has gone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about the $300 million reform to residential aged care? Where is that in the Liberal Party election manifesto? I warn members of the government who are here that that is an issue that is going to affect hundreds of thousands of Australians in a very direct way. They will have to sell their properties or take new mortgage arrangements to meet this new residential aged care slug. Tax slug, that is what it is&mdash;a new tax slug.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These sorts of issues are a betrayal of what was clearly enunciated by Mr Howard and Mr Costello prior to the election. I challenge those members in the government, as I challenged Senator Hill last night on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS>: when will they own up to breaking one promise? We had the pathetic attempts, the  arrogant attempts, by Mr Costello and Senator Alston to justify the cuts to the ABC. I think everyone was appalled at Senator Alston's performance. Four or five weeks ago on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> he was quoted as saying on election night that ABC funding would be maintained.</PARA>

He stated that over and over again before the election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some other issues. We have identified at least 27 major broken promises in this budget, or promises not in this budget&mdash;issues, policies, promises that should have been delivered on. I started to mention a few of them when we were taking note of answers to questions. Let us just take the child&hyphen;care area as an example. The promise was made to maintain the non-means testing of the child-care cash rebate. The budget reduces the level of rebates for families with incomes above the family tax initiative threshold from 30 per cent to 20 per cent. That is a clear breaking of an election promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A clear election promise was to maintain the system of child-care assistance. But the budget caps access to child-care assistance at 50 hours per week per child. It freezes child-care assistance and child-care cash rebate fee ceilings for two years. It abolishes additional income allowed for additional dependent children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had the pre-emptive announcement, or the pre pre-emptive announcement, by Senator Vanstone on education when she was wining and dining with the vice-chancellors. Then we got the pre-emptive announcement last week. It is clear that Senator Vanstone was all too unclear when she engaged in a heavy bout of socialising at that dinner with the vice-chancellors. But she was deadly serious about the proposed cuts to higher education. Where was this outlined in the Liberal party policy document?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another area is foreign aid. The promise was made to make cuts to business subsidies in the aid program. The budget contains further cuts in the aid program over and above the DIFF abolition, saving $70 million, $78 million, $78 million and $80 million over a four-year period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another promise was to maintain the real value of pension benefits and entitlements. We have had the abolition of the Commonwealth dental program. I mentioned that earlier. Some people in the Liberal Party, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2820"> particularly Mr Costello, who is all too arrogant and all too fond of scoffing, might think the abolition of the dental program is a minor matter. But it is very important, particularly to elderly Australians. To elderly Australians, having good teeth is very important. The Liberal Party apparently thinks it can be disposed of like some throwaway false teeth. That is another false promise.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The 1996-97 budget, the first coalition budget in 14 years, is a budget of hope. It is a budget which rejects failure. It is a budget which is honest and it is a budget which has not sought to hide from reality. It accepts the responsibility of cleaning up the mess of 13 years of Labor's dismal economic failure. As Max Walsh wrote in this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> , the bottom line is that last night saw a budget presented that is good for business and good for Australia. It saw the first half-decent budget of the 1990s.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the coalition took office in March, the economy had just entered its fifth year of economic growth. The economy had been growing slowly after the recession Labor said we had to have. That recession had devastated the lives of millions of Australians. In fact, it was in Labor's recession that the official <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2821"> statistic of unemployed got to one million people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even though the economy was just growing in March, a couple of other statistics were absolutely ripping along. Government revenue had grown by 30 per cent over four years. This was the result of Labor's tax feast in the 1993 budget. But even with this economic growth and this magnitude of revenue growth, Labor still could not balance the books. So for the past four years Australians have seen their public assets sold off to pay for the daily expenses of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Qantas, the Commonwealth Bank, the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories and many more&mdash;nearly $9 billion worth of assets&mdash;were sold or put up for sale. But even that was not enough to bring in a balanced budget so Labor stopped investing in the public infrastructure. Capital outlays by the Commonwealth government declined by 135 per cent between 1992-93 and the last financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Still the budget was locked into deficit. How locked? Just look at the underlying deficit outcomes for the past four years&mdash;$14.5 thousand million, $13.6 thousand million, $11.6 thousand million and $10.3 thousand million. With Labor, the Commonwealth budget and Australian taxpayers were certainly going very quickly into debt. Labor's record on debt is absolutely outstanding if that is what you regard high debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In June 1991 the Commonwealth owed $34,000 million. The next year it had grown to $45,000 million. Just two months ago it had risen to $106,000 million. Most significantly, the increased debt has to be serviced. Interest on public debt has to be paid. In 1991-92, interest paid on behalf of the Commonwealth was $3.9 billion. Last year, it had increased to $8.5 thousand million and this year, as a result of their debt of $106 billion, the interest payment will total $9.3 thousand million. This means the Commonwealth will be spending this year more on debt in interest than it does on public order and safety and about the same as it does on defence and education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some people say that debt does not matter. Can anyone imagine how much better off this <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> nation would be if we could increase education, health or labour market expenditure by $9 billion? Of course the reality is that we will never get our debt down to zero. It is too late for that, but to find a spare $100,000 million is not easy. It is not realistic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we can do and what this government will do is stabilise the debt by running surpluses in the budget. Combined with the proceeds from the partial privatisation of Telstra, this will allow the Commonwealth to gradually reduce the debt burden and lower the amount of money that has to be set aside to pay interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When all honourable senators consider this budget, they must think carefully about the consequences of increasing the budget deficit. Every cutback that is rejected or revenue measure refused will mean a bigger deficit, greater debt, more interest payments, greater instability in the economy, uncertainty and, ultimately, more volatile interest rates for the community. This is not a threat; this is the reality of what happens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, all senators must weigh up the value of expenditures and the merit of revenue measures, but they must also decide whether it is better to retain the failure of the past or to take a chance with hope for the future. As to those who say that debt does not matter, I ask this question: if the level of debt does not matter, why do all Australians and every government around the world think that it does?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year the government's debt was equal to 80 per cent of the government's budget and around 25 per cent of our GDP. Would it matter if that were doubled to 50 per cent of GDP? Of course it would. Can you imagine a government debt of $250,000 million, an interim bill per annum of, say, $25 billion? Would it matter? Of course it would matter. Our economy would be wrecked and useless. Republic or not, selling bananas would be our country's only activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2822"> Today the opposition wants to talk about broken promises in the budget as though pinning some form of crown of thorns upon the head of the government. Let me say this: if there was one crucial promise to the Australian people that was made by a Common wealth government in the past nine months, it was the guarantee given by the now Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, that the Commonwealth budget was in surplus. It was not, and he and his government failed to tell the people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is proud of the 1996 budget. This is a budget that delivers and gives hope for Australian families. It is a budget of promises fulfilled for middle and low income Australians. The family tax package, the health care initiatives, the tax changes for small businesses, the restoration of equality for self-funded retirees, the development and extension of apprenticeships and training for the young, the preservation of Medicare, bulk-billing, community rating, twice yearly indexation of pensions and the myriad of other initiatives launched in this budget are so overwhelmingly positive for ordinary Australians that any attempt by the opposition or others to focus attention on what is not in the budget will be swiftly and deservedly ignored by the Australian public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is flattered by the opposition's matter of public importance today. Who would have thought that on the first day after the first coalition budget in 14 years the Labor Party would want to debate what was not in the budget. And with such an important debate who would have thought their leader would fail to appear to lead the charge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's budget is the first honest and open attempt by an Australian government to set our economic condition to one of health since the late 1980s, when former Senator Peter Walsh drilled the Labor cabinets. I know that Peter Walsh would think the government has not gone far enough in this budget, and so do others. As Alan Wood, writing in this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If he&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the Treasurer&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is to be criticised it is not for being too tough, or breaking promises, but for not being tough enough.</PARA>
<PARA>He concluded the passage with the words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Instead of playing sleazy games in the Senate Labor should apologise for its terrible failure as a financial manager and help Costello clean up the mess.   <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>To Alan Wood's call I can only add this: it is the hope of the government that we can work with all senators to create a fiscal foundation for the future growth and prosperity of every person in this nation. If that hope is proved to be flawed, it will not be because of the position adopted by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first Costello budget will give this country and its people, now and into the future, pride and hope. There comes a time when every nation must move on from failure and disappointment. Now is that time. Now offers that chance, and no amount of hypocritical finger waving must be allowed to prevent our nation moving on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this matter of public importance the Labor opposition and anyone who supports them demonstrate that they are out of touch with the aspirations of average Australians. The first Costello budget is fair, is responsible and is believable. It is a good budget that is good for all Australians.</PARA></SPEECH>

A range of areas were targeted last night.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I mean `exorcised'. That is how bad they were&mdash;no kidding. They were taken away because the government was scared that in some way the negative impact of those broken election promises would overshadow what small good parts were contained in the budget last night. But I can tell you that it did not diminish community protest or outrage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Gibson, there has been a swift reaction. There has been a swift reaction on behalf of the community, community groups, lobby groups and those people who are victimised, poorer and disadvantaged in our society because of this budget. And they have got good reason to complain. Today we should review some of the promises that were made by the coalition government during the election campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For a start, the coalition promised to at least maintain operating grants to universities, and what have we got? Over the next four years operating grants to universities will be cut by over $623 million. What a broken promise. That absolutely flies in the face of its election commitments. In fact, the coalition states in its `A fair go for students' package that the HECS repayment threshold will not drop below average weekly earnings. What is a drop from around $28,000 per annum down to $20,800 per annum? It is a sizeable drop.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I like the comments Senator Vanstone made in the chamber today that this somehow will not disadvantage lower income families when in actual fact a one-income family of two who are repaying their HECS debt will be doing so at 88 per cent of the poverty line. So you are hitting hardest those people in our community who are from lower socioeconomic groups, despite your purported commitment to access and equity in higher education. I have yet to see any evidence in this budget that supports those people who have been traditionally disadvantaged in the higher education sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about the three-tier system for HECS? What about 35 per cent increases on HECS <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> debt? Senator Gibson, you said that debt does matter. We think it matters; we oppose the accumulated debt that young people and students are getting in our society. We are telling you that it is a psychological and financial disincentive to enter and to pursue higher education, but no-one seems to have factored that in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Vanstone talked about lower socioeconomic groups not increasing their participation rate in higher education. That is true. Over the last decade they are the only target equity group that has not increased their participation rate. So what do you do? You put more fees and charges in their way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That reminds me of another promise&mdash;that you would not introduce up&hyphen;front, full cost fees for undergraduate places. What have you done? You have allowed up to 25 per cent of university courses to be charged full cost, up&hyphen;front fees. We are assuming that is what the cost will be, because you have not actually put a cap on that. You have not put a maximum amount, you have put a minimum amount that people have to pay; so who knows what prices young people and students are going to be subject to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for Austudy, again the promise was that it would be maintained at real levels. What happened? The government has introduced tighter eligibility criteria, the government has removed it for certain homeless students and the government has removed it for certain single students who are sharing accommodation. I have just discovered&mdash;and I wish the minister were here because I would like an answer to this&mdash;that in order to assess a student's eligibility for Austudy they will be assessed at the day they enrol for a course. So, if you are 24 years and nine months old and you are applying for a degree in, say, medicine and you are not eligible because the independent rate age has been increased to 25, even when you are studying at the age of 30 you are still ineligible because you are assessed from the time that you enrol.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what is this? Is this budget `Honey, I slugged the kids'? It is about young people and students accumulating debt. It is about young people not being given a real start in our society, contrary to the claims&mdash;and I <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2824"> found them quite ironic&mdash;in Minister Vanstone's paraphernalia last night. So Austudy is another broken promise. Fancy increasing the independent rate age from 22 to 25. It contradicts your voting record over the past three years. It contradicts everything Senator Robert Hill said when he was shadow minister for this portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other promise you made&mdash;and I can quote from your Liberal Party document&mdash;was `The Liberal Party will not return our universities to the elitist system that previously existed. No Australian should be prevented from attending university because of their financial circumstances.' But you have allowed universities to charge up&hyphen;front, full cost fees. If that does not return us to a situation where it is an elite education system for the rich, I do not know what will.</PARA>

Instead, we have hit them hard with debts, we are going to charge them up&hyphen;front fees, we have cut off their youth broadcasting network&mdash;or at least restricted its expansion&mdash;we have hit hard at the ABC and we have cut fundamentally and drastically labour market programs which offered young people the one hope they had, especially those who are disadvantaged or unemployed in our society.

<TIME.STAMP>(4.21 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Liberals are back in government and dishonesty is back in budgets. We have seen in the headline today of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  a broken promise on taxation. One of the core promises that this government made to the electorate before the election was that there would be no new taxes, no increase in existing taxes and no changes in other taxes. According to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> &mdash;they have done the sums and there is no reason to dispute them&mdash;there is a $6 billion tax slug which is new and which constitutes a broken promise by this government. This government therefore lied to the electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> It is not surprising that today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> magazine shows that most electors would not have voted for them if they knew the outcome of this budget. But this is in the fine tradition of the coalition because the now Prime Minister (Mr Howard) when Treasurer in the election of 1980 became infamous and got the tag `Honest John' as an ironic appellation because he promised a fistful of dollars to the Australian electorate and double&hyphen;crossed it on every promise he came to after that in deliver ing the tax cuts that he then undertook to deliver.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there should be no surprise now that the same pattern of deceit and dishonesty is in train here&mdash;cuts to the elderly, costs to higher education, greater health care costs, costs to students, costs to the unemployed, costs even to drive on Australian roads in prospect, and of course cuts to the ABC. That is what this budget amounts to&mdash;a rash of broken promises by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a major statistic missing from this budget. It is not in the budget speech; it is not in the budget papers. The Treasurer, Mr Costello, and Mr Howard have not mentioned it. What is the missing statistic? The missing statistic is this: what will be the reduction in the level of unemployment in Australia because of this budget? There is no statistic to say what that figure will be. And the reason? Because the government does not believe in its heart of hearts that there will be in fact a reduction in unemployment in this country. In the budget speech there is an assertion that unemployment may in fact go up, but there is no figure, there is no forecast and there is no estimate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And if you cannot judge a budget by what it does to the unemployed and offer hope to those who are now without work, how do you judge a budget in terms of its social standing and its moral efficacy? This budget does not give that figure. This budget, which is brought down by a government which promised the electorate before the election that it would restore hope and employment, and particularly for the young, has no idea of what the outcome of unemployment will be after this budgetary year and because of these settings&mdash;none whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government castigated us in government when we set a goal for ourselves of five per cent national unemployment by the year 2000. Have they set a goal for themselves on unemployment? No, they have not. Have they indicated what they think the outcome will be down the track? No, they have not. And have they set up a budget which will in fact grow the Australian economy and create jobs in industry? No, they have not.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2826">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sad and sorry flaw in this budget is that it attacks the ability of Australian industry to take advantage of international growth and grow too. What this budget is predicated on is a contractionary domestic economy. That is not what the Treasurer said on budget night, but it is what the budget papers say when you go to the fine print of what the forecasts will be. Indeed, in the budget papers the forecast is given, and I read from Budget Paper No. 1, page 2&hyphen;21:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . possible confidence effects, while significant, do not fully offset the direct short&hyphen;term effects of the measures, resulting in&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and here is the point to note&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a small net contractionary impact on activity in 1996&hyphen;97.</PARA>
<PARA>What does that mean? In plain English, it means business conditions will be worse next year. That is what it means. And business confidence, of course, is low now&mdash;it is at very low levels. Business confidence will be shattered by the budget cuts that have reduced consumer purchasing power as consumers have to foot higher bills for pharmaceuticals, taxes and charges levied on them by the states because of the actions taken by this federal government over state revenues as well. So the impact is, in a very low level of consumer confidence and business outlook for the future, to contract the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But how does this government say it will save the Australian economy? It points to high demand in the international economy&mdash;that is, `The rest of the world is doing all right; we will do worse but, if we trade with the rest of the world, we will lift our economy up by its bootstraps'&mdash;as this government infers in its budget documentation. How does it propose to do that? It slashed $500 million out of export promotion programs and it slashed $346 million out of manufacturing industry, so the two areas where you would expect to see some help to take advantage of buoyant international economic conditions for the Australian domestic economy&mdash;export and manufacturing&mdash;are gone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And remember, one of the proudest records of growth in Australian exports is the growth of manufactured goods in this economy, averaging between 16 and 17 per cent a year <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> over the last nine years, with the highest growth being from elaborately transformed manufactures, the goods that require the most sophisticated and skilled workers to manufacture. The supports that made that possible are now gone, and the supports that helped small business access international markets are now gone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We hope to connect with the international economy. I will tell you what we will do, Mr Acting Deputy President: we will connect all right&mdash;we will connect in the traditional areas of mining and agriculture, and maybe we will sell a few places to tourists. Once again Australia will revert to being a mine and a farm and a tourist destination, but we will not be a highly skilled manufacturing economy creating smart jobs for intelligent, well&hyphen;trained Australians, offering high pay and remuneration for the future. And we will not make the bridge into the international economy, either. You can sell so much iron ore and coal, and you can sell so much wheat and wool, but you cannot buy back the elaborately transformed and sophisticated manufactured goods that you need by just doing that; you have to export manufactured goods as well. This budget is deceitful because it undermines our ability to do that and, in domestic economic terms, it is a contractionary budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of areas where industry has been undermined. This budget is sold as a budget for small business. It is not; it is a budget that undermines small business. If you are a small business with a bright idea, then the R&amp;D tax deductions which enable you to commercialise that bright idea have now been significantly reduced. If you are not in profit and therefore need access to a syndicate, forget it: you have not got that access any more, because it has been stamped out. Farewell to our smart ideas and intelligent science. That will now go overseas and be commercialised by foreigners and sold back to Australians at higher prices. That is what this budget does.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are a worker without the necessary skills to adapt to a modern economy, forget the opportunities of training, retraining and re&hyphen;skilling, because what this budget does is put the axe through labour market programs and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2827"> remove your opportunity to get out of the dole queue, to get some skills for yourself and to take a place in a high skilled economy. We are on the low skilled road now: we are de&hyphen;skilling Australians and reducing the opportunities for Australian industry to have access to highly skilled labour that they will need if they are going to compete in the international marketplace. Forget those things because what this budget does is undermine those expectations for Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Forget as well those industry sectors in the economy that have performed very well, those industry sectors that have made the harsh transition from being highly protected&mdash;sectors like the textile, clothing and footwear sector; the book publishing sector; the heavy engineering sector in the economy that requires access to modern machine tools; the shipbuilding sector in Australia; the information technology and telecommunications sector in Australia&mdash;because government supports that levelled the playing field a bit and helped those sectors grow and compete internationally are all removed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are a shipbuilder in Australia, if you are a fast ferry manufacturer in this country, you are a world&hyphen;class manufacturer; but do not think that you are going to get any help from the government as competitors with you will get from their governments, because you will not. That support goes&mdash;and that is where the jobs are too, and those jobs go with those industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My lower house colleague Simon Crean has put out today a list of several deceptions and betrayals of industry by this government. They range from the export market development grants right through to the R&amp;D deduction changes, the undermining of Austrade and AusIndustry and a range of other things like computer bounty. They are deceptions, and this government is condemned.</PARA></SPEECH>

You <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2828"> need to remember that; we all need to remember it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unless we are prepared in this parliament&mdash;and I throw this out as a challenge also to the minor parties in this place&mdash;and unless you are prepared to be a constructive part of addressing that debt problem, you are going to find that the living standards in this country will slide. It is a bigger picture than just addressing one or two issues and saying, `This one is a winner' or `This one is a loser'; we will all be losers unless we address the aspect of national debt. For the industries that have been raised here today, whether they involve manufacturing, some form of value adding, agriculture or mining, the single biggest problem today in their ability to compete internationally&mdash;and we all have to do it if we are going to maintain our living standards&mdash;is debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been saying that for the six years that I have been in here. You can attest to that by having a look at some of the speeches in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. You have that responsibility on your head, Senator Cook. I congratulate Mr Costello for taking steps to move to that aspect of our problem while keeping the core promises of the election campaign intact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to emphasise one or two other aspects about the situation of where one could expect to be in coming to government regarding what was said prior to the election. I refer to the previous Prime Minister, Mr Keating, on the subject of being in surplus. On 10 May 1995, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Next year we will have a budget surplus, which will be arrived at free of any asset sales or redemptions in debt. We will go on then to produce huge surpluses in the future so it is a massive change.</PARA>
<PARA>What did we find when we got into government? Not the anticipated $8 billion black hole, the living off the Bankcard; we found that, in fact, that deficit was $10.3 billion. People in this place who believe that we would have been responsible in government to ignore that situation and not set out to address it in the fairest possible way are just fooling themselves. More importantly, they are fooling the Australian public and they are going to do enormous future damage. The <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mortgage that has been placed on our children and our grandchildren would have been extended to our great-grandchildren. On this side of this chamber and on our side of the other chamber we are not prepared to allow that to continue. That is why we have taken the measures that we have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The prophecy of my words will be judged in three years time  when I firmly believe that you will find both the economic conditions in this country and our capacity to manage and run ourselves greatly improved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On top of that, we will have the charter of budget honesty. The Australian public would have known the state of the books if that charter had been in place before the last election. If the public had known the state of the books, the rout of the Australian Labor Party in that election would have been far greater.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has delivered a budget to help families; protect those less able to look after themselves; reward individual effort, and I want to underline that; encourage small business; and guarantee a fair go for all. Those people have responded positively to the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget is a greater effort at fiscal consolidation, a matter about which I have spoken. It reduces the budget deficit by $7.2 billion over the next two years, primarily through fair and equitable reductions in outlays.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget is an investment in the future by raising public savings and thereby national savings, which is absolutely crucial in addressing our current debt and our ability to get off the bankcard on which the Labor Party lived to the tune of running up an additional $80 billion of debt in the last six budgets. That was the Labor Party's record and that is what it has to understand. Until such time as the Labor Party addresses that, it will stay right where it is.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What a difference a week makes in politics. The handing down of the budget really was a watershed for this government. On any analysis, we have got over that very difficult period in the lead&hyphen;up to the budget <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2829"> when there were many false reports and leaks. All the haunting that went on before the budget did not come about. The budget really has been welcomed by the Australian public and by all commentators who acknowledged that a strategy is now in place to bring the budget into balance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this is the week that was for the government, on any analysis the Australian Labor Party has had a disastrous week which began with those disgraceful scenes of violence the other day in the parliamentary foyer. For all the harm and shame that brought, it revealed the irresponsibility and the neglect of some union leaders&mdash;and no less than Bill Kelty. I remind the Senate that Bill Kelty has not retracted his comments that he believed it was one of the most successful demonstrations ever held in Canberra. That comment has damaged the opposition because Bill Kelty is clearly recognised as a Labor man. He must be an embarrassment today for the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, we had the absolute shock resignation of Senator Colston, which shifted the power axis in this Senate. Because we now have another option to get our budget through, we believe that there will be a less obstructionist attitude; whereas before it was a certainty that we would have our budget obstructed and frustrated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On top of that very poor week for the Labor Party, they have now come into this chamber with this matter of public importance to cap it off. And to think there are still two days to go! Listening to Senator Sherry and the other opposition speakers, one would conclude that Labor is still in the self&hyphen;denial mode of the 1996 election. I do not know how much longer it will go on. They really believe they are the keepers of the flame for the poor, the sick, the elderly, the young and the like.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> But the truth is that they are the cause of these people's woes. They gave the poor a greater gap between the rich and the poor. In the last budget in government they lifted the Medicare levy of the sick. They broke the promise to the old to remove pensioners from the tax system. And they gave the young 28 per cent to 30 per cent unemployment. More over, during their 13 years in government, they took every Australian on a roller&hyphen;coaster ride of high interest rates and debt. It came to a crushing end in 1996 with the equivalent worst current account deficit in the OECD&mdash;worse than Mexico's. I remember the ambassador for Mexico complaining that we even dared compare their current account with Australia's.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party left us with a foreign debt greater than $180 billion; six consecutive deficits; an $8 billion hole which has now jumped to $10 billion; an interest rate second only in real terms to that of Italy's; and a disgraceful unemployment rate fixed at greater than eight per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a privilege to be in government. But when the Labor Party had that privilege nothing greater symbolised their attitude towards breaking promises than the key 1993 budget. That has even been conceded by the former Prime Minister and by the best analysis by Gary Gray, a man who has all the research before him. He conceded that the 1993 budget was so full of broken promises that it ruptured for good the Australian voter's support for the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first and most infamous broken promise was the l&hyphen;a&hyphen;w law tax cuts which never eventuated regardless of the then Prime Minister saying that the tax cuts were enshrined in law. Of course, that comment was a fraud. The second most infamous broken promise in that 1993 budget was the hiking up of sales tax to the tune of nearly $4 billion&mdash;a broken promise Senator Cook had responsibility for carrying through the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third most infamous broken promise in the 1993 budget was the lifting of the company tax rate from 33 per cent to 36 per cent, regardless again of the former Prime Minister's commitment, `What I am promising is not to put up taxes.' Those opposite never recovered from that deceit and the magnitude of the 1996 election gives evidence to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now we have the child of trampoline economics, Senator Sherry, preaching to the Senate about election promises. Senator Sherry's generation of politicians are going to have to wear for many years to come the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2830"> deceit of their past colleagues. At every branch and community meeting and every industry meeting that the likes of Senator Sherry attend they will have this quoted back to them, `How can we trust you when you were so dishonest when you had an opportunity in government&mdash;you broke so many promises in government.' You will have this repeated to you out in the community at just about every meeting you go to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It really will be a very long crawl back to credibility for the opposition. This week's events&mdash;the worst I have known for the Labor Party since I have been in parliament&mdash;really are a setback to the crawl back to credibility.

Personal protection will not be regarded as a genuine reason for owning, possessing or using a firearm.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A significant element of the measures is the amnesty and compensation scheme for owners of self-loading rifles, self-loading shotguns and pump-action shotguns. Such guns are to be the subject of nationwide restrictions. There will be limited access to certain categories of self-loading rifles and shotguns and pump-action shotguns for primary producers and exemptions for military, police and occupational shooters licensed for a specific purpose such as extermination of feral animals. The scheme will require gun owners to hand in firearms falling within the restricted categories during the nationwide amnesty period in return for fair and proper compensation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth agreed to meet fully the direct cost of the compensation-for-surrender scheme, funds for which have been raised by a one-off increase in the Medicare levy for the income year 1996-97. This increase is already in effect and it remains only to permit the monies raised to be paid to the states and territories to assist them in achieving the full implementation of the new nationwide gun control measures overwhelmingly supported by the majority of the Australian people. A very large total cost is involved. It is estimated that the increase in the Medicare levy will raise around $500 million. This government has agreed to provide assistance to the states on such a scale to demonstrate national leadership in dealing with the problem of gun control.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill allows the Attorney-General to authorise payments by way of financial assistance to the states and territories for the purpose of providing compensation to firearms owners and dealers. It also allows the Attorney-General to authorise payments to the states and territories and by the Commonwealth for purposes directly connected to the compensation scheme and for implementation of the new nationwide licensing and registration schemes. The bill appropriates monies from the Consolidated Revenue Fund for these purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Payments for reimbursement of compensation paid for surrendered firearms are limited to those surrendered during the national amnesty period of 10 May this year to 30 September next year, or such shorter period as the Attorney-General determines if any jurisdiction decides on a shorter amnesty. Gun dealers will also be able to claim for loss of business associated with surrender of stock <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2831"> and the Commonwealth will reimburse the states and territories for compensation paid in relation to such claims if the claim is lodged during the national amnesty period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Swift action is essential if we are to have really effective nationwide firearms laws. The Commonwealth has already demonstrated its commitment by acting quickly to amend the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations to complement the resolutions of the Australasian Police Ministers' Council and by increasing the Medicare levy. Now it is time to take the next step to support the states and territories in their endeavours to achieve effective controls.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Simple and short though it is, this bill is of major importance in the implementation of the national firearms program. It provides support to the states and territories, will enable the compensation-for-surrender scheme to go ahead and, I hope, encourage owners of banned firearms to come forward and surrender them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is, therefore, extremely important that the bill be passed through the Parliament as quickly as possible. The government acknowledged this by introducing it in the House of Representatives on the first day of sittings. We have had multi-partisan support right from the beginning for the new nationwide firearms laws. That has been invaluable in achieving community consensus. In the House of Representatives, the opposition gave its continued support to the measures being taken and the bill was passed the day after it was introduced. I ask all of you here in this place also to continue to support the proposed nationwide measures being taken and pass this bill quickly. In this way we will help to encourage the speedy surrender of these firearms and ensure greater protection from violence for the whole Australian community. Let us all act together to make this country a safer place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill amends the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Act 1990 to implement the government's election commitment to expand substantially the benefits available under the Defence Homeowner Scheme. The bill also makes corrections to the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government recognises that the dedicated service of Defence men and women is a critical element in maintaining Australia's national security. The conditions of service for those men and women must be tailored not only to providing appropriate remuneration for their efforts but also to recognising the unique characteristics of Defence Service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Defence Homeowner Scheme is established by the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Act. It is designed to meet the requirements of both the Defence Force and individual members. It offers an interest rate subsidy on home loans which is related to length of service, with the benefit being enhanced for members who provide operational service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The characteristics of Defence Force service&mdash;such as regular postings to different locations&mdash;make home ownership a particular challenge for our Service personnel. The Homeowner Scheme assists them to meet that challenge.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coalition parties' Defence election policy pledged enhancement of the benefits in the Homeowner Scheme and its extension to eligible members of the Reserves. This bill delivers those policy pledges.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Act double the maximum amount of subsidised loans to $80,000 (or $160,000 where spouses have a joint entitlement). This increase will be available for existing as well as new borrowers under the Homeowner Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the case of members rendering continuous full&hyphen;time service, the basic eligibility period for new borrowers is reduced from 6 to 5 years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Homeowner Scheme will also be extended to Reservists who have completed a basic eligibility period of 8 years of statutory training obligation. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2832"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The remaining amendments made by the bill relate to references in the Defence Force Discipline Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Defence Force Discipline Act provides a code for the investigation and prosecution of service offences committed by members of the Defence Force. The act itself specifies some offences directly related to Defence Force service and deals with other more general offences (such as aggravated assault and burglary) by adopting the criminal law applying in the Jervis Bay Territory. The law applying in the Jervis Bay Territory is essentially the law of the Australian Capital Territory, which has included the New South Wales Crimes Act, as amended by laws of the Australian Capital Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1992, Australian Capital Territory legislation changed the status of the Crimes Act in force in the Australian Capital Territory (and which is therefore applied to the Jervis Bay Territory) from an act of New South Wales to an act of the Australian Capital Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current references in the Defence Force Discipline Act to the Crimes Act of New South Wales in its application to the Jervis Bay Territory therefore need to be replaced by references to the Crimes Act of the Australian Capital Territory in its application to the Jervis Bay Territory. Failure to make the change could put at risk prosecutions based on Defence Force Discipline Act provisions adopting Crimes Act offences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the Defence Force Discipline Act will correct these references from the date of commencement of the relevant Australian Capital Territory legislation.</PARA>

<STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(4.50 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Madam President, members of the Senate and, in particular, my colleagues from Western Australia. It is entirely appropriate for a politician from Australia's first and best women's party to introduce himself to the Senate with a tribute to women&mdash;three of them to be precise&mdash;to whom I owe so very much. I salute and thank first my mother, second my wife and, most recent in my life, my leader, all of whom have got me this far. I also salute and thank my political mentor Jack Evans and, most importantly, I thank the 94,000 Western Australians who gave me their primary vote.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am the third Western Australian to be a Democrat senator and the first to be elected at a half&hyphen;Senate election. I am not Australian born but I have wanted to live in this wonderful country all my adult life. I first applied as an immigrant in 1972. It was only in 1989 that I finally made it. I am profoundly grateful to the Australian people for welcoming me and my family as they have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not going to spell out what attracted me as a migrant. I doubt the attractions of Australia for me were much different from those of the millions who have preceded me. But I will spell out some of what drove me to the Democrats and into Australian political life. I have had a very wide experience of life which has included travelling extensively and living and working in four countries on three continents. So I feel qualified to compare Australia with other countries. Every country is unique and worthwhile in its own way. But Australia, more than most, has such a rich and varied environment. It has such sweep and space, such grandeur and mystery. It has space for the soul and laughter, for achievement and contentment. It has such great prospects, such an attractive way of life and such a strong culture and style.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2833">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I came to politics because I had most of all a sense that what we had in Australia was so worth preserving. With this in mind, for me it was inevitable that I would feel obliged to adopt a protective, conserving and caring political party, rooted in the heart and not the pocket, one with an alternative story line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is what has made me a strong environmentalist. It is what has made me so opposed to the current economic dogma. It is what has made me so opposed to the carpetbagger approach of selling off our assets to foreigners. Economic colonialism is such an unattractive theology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have known war, strikes, riots and economic sanctions. I have known the menace of state security in the old regimes of Africa. I know the difference between tyranny and democracy. I am proud to be in this liberated and advanced democracy. But I am also aware of the road stretching before us. You will hear me plead for more openness, accountability, transparency and progressive participative democracy in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a WA senator I must touch on my state. Unfortunately, despite its many virtues and strengths, in my view it is still a state tainted by maladministration and it is still consistently failing to sufficiently and satisfactorily address community needs and expectations. It is still a state where the 1992 royal commission recommendations and the 1995/1996 Commission on Government recommendations have not been enacted. Until they are, WA Inc. lives on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of the people who occupy positions of power and influence in WA's government see it as little more than an extension of the business sector. Any part of government that is not making money, saving money or furthering the immediate goals of the business sector, has come to be seen by these people as less relevant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The institution of government has internalised the value system of economic rationalism to the point where it has lost its civic vision of what its broad community role and responsibility should be. Government has come to believe that at best its role is to use its powers and resources to facilitate commercial and private enterprise. Beyond that it seems to see <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> itself as merely an inconvenient and irrelevant aspect of community life which should make itself as small as possible or do away with itself altogether.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Government is not an alien imposition on the community. Government is not a virus from Mars or a cruel joke of the gods. Societies have fought long and hard to establish democratic government. The ancient Greeks knew that government done properly is the people, is the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Government is an integral and inherent part of any healthy community. Government is for society&mdash;to give effect to society's cares and responsibilities in the broadest sense. Human society cannot and must not be reduced to mere business values and transactions, and neither can government be reduced to mere financial, commercial or economic knob twiddling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make some brief remarks on constitutional matters arising out of extensive work I did for WA's Commission on Government. I am one of those who sets great store by our social contract&mdash;our constitution. The Australian constitution gained its legitimacy by being designed by Australians and by being convincingly approved by the people by referendum. In contrast, the Western Australian constitution is an act of the United Kingdom, reinforced by subsequent legislation in WA. It has never been accorded popular and democratic approval through a convincing referendum process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In WA we have an incomplete and fragmented set of precedents and documents that provide something of a constitutional framework. Certainly, there is no single, holistic and cohesive constitutional document. It does not exist, although the state is trying to write up a summary document.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2834"> As a result of the democratic process, the sovereignty of the Australian people has been established as the fundamental underpinning of the Australian constitution. The sovereignty of the people might be implicit in the WA state constitution, but it is certainly not its fundamental basis. In its origin the WA state constitution was not founded on the consent of the Western Australian people. WA Aboriginals might well regard the WA constitu tion as alien and offensive. It is still non&hyphen;inclusive. Under this existing constitution WA Aboriginals suffered appallingly and the most basic of human rights were violated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current system of government in WA has its roots in imperialism and colonialism, in constitutional monarchy and executive dominance. The WA state constitution reflects this historical milieu. The original Australians, the Aboriginal people, had no place nor say in its making, neither did Australian women, by and large. Many Western Australians advocate change and major improvements to our systems of government. They deserve to get it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I and the Australian Democrats believe that Australia should be a sovereign, democratic and independent republic with an Australian head of state. It follows that I do not agree with the current nature and method of selection of a state governor who owes allegiance to a foreign power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that any state constitution has to recognise the just claims for inclusion and rights of the Aboriginal peoples. I believe that the legislative, executive and judicial powers must be separated. The ending of executive dominance of all the branches of government is required. I believe that the quota&hyphen;preferential system of proportional representation should be enshrined in our state constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to touch briefly on secrecy in WA, but these remarks are also apposite to government elsewhere. Again, this has had much focus by the Commission on Government in WA. My view is that dark deeds are always done in secret. Corruption and malfeasance only occur in secret. It is logical that the less secrecy the better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are over 100 acts in WA with secrecy clauses&mdash;a situation the Commission on Government has condemned. I want a style of government where the ethos of secrecy is in retreat, not maintained and reinforced. Secrecy in public affairs is not desirable of itself. Secrecy does not have equal weight with openness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reconciliation of secrecy with openness can be achieved by three means. Firstly, ensuring that grey and discretionary areas for <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> decisions on secrecy in laws, government and public office are almost eliminated. Secondly, by enshrining in legislation that where there is doubt the bias is always to fall on the side of public interest, accountability, exposure and access. Thirdly, repealing all secrecy provisions in the 100&hyphen;plus WA acts identified as having them, and only if necessary reconstituting them as exemptions in the Freedom of Information Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to touch on values now. People like me become activists not because we believe we can save the world but because we believe each individual can and must make a difference and that, if some essential truths, values and issues are under threat, we must join the fight to save or preserve them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With politics as a new career, I have asked myself the question as to whether or not I have entered a profession, or even an honourable one. My <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Chambers Dictionary</EMPHASIS> defines a profession as requiring some degree of learning and as a calling. It also defines it as a pretence! For the first time in my life I know what it is like to be a lawyer, always having your occupation pilloried. I am now a member of a profession which is characterised at its worst as opportunist, cynical, manipulative, self&hyphen;serving, dishonest and not to be trusted. I do not like that much. I doubt that any of us do. It may not be true, but that perception is out there and I think it is important to conduct politics in a way that lessens and not increases that perception.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that the greatest task for your government is to start to restore the faith of the people in government. In my view, that is an impossible and insurmountable task if we go on as we have been. I will be making my own effort to maintain the high ideals of politics. I have already met senators who give you great faith in their humanity and decency, regardless of their political persuasion. No doubt I will also meet the other kind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People who do know better do abuse our trust. However, priests who defile children, lawyers who launder cash and politicians who lie have not yet, thankfully, destroyed our faith in our ideals. Ideals transcend humanity's failings. Fallible priests are still part of the doctrine of aspiration. Their calling does <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2835"> still promote love, faith, hope and charity. Those lawyers greedily approbating and reprobating over their victims are nevertheless part of a profession of high ideals. Their calling still does promote equity and fairness, justice and truth. Lying politicians feeding off ego and power are still part of our social and institutional drive for perfection. The role of politicians still is to resolve the tensions of society, to make the present better and the future safe and fulfilling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The governments that have governed my state and the country over the past 20 years have followed broadly similar policies. Yet the people tell me our society has deteriorated&mdash;fractured communities, aggressive citizens, unsafe streets, fewer and more insecure jobs and greater stress. Rural and regional Australia sometimes scream with the pain of it all. It must surely be time for governments to say, `Hang on. Have we got this right? Has the economic and political speak been right? Is there a better way?' I know that no&hyphen;one comes to this place wanting to make things worse&mdash;of course not. But have the right choices been made, even in good faith?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A fundamental premise is that the government is there to look after the little guy. It is sometimes a little difficult to remember the little guy when it is always the big, the articulate and the moneyed breathing in your face. It is not good enough to talk small business but act and crony with big; to talk individual choice but to exploit the individual; to talk community and family but to leave each of us to our own devices. These little guys feel there is a massive attempt to transfer expenditure on services from the government to the individual, from the community to the person&mdash;toll roads, health, education, phones and television&mdash;and becoming a society which says, `You've got to make it on your own; there's no&hyphen;one out there for you.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my nearly 30 years in the business world I have grappled with money, management, machines and massive change. I hated the firings, even when they were essential. When I see figures like 15,000 public servants retrenched, I do not just see millions of dollars; I see aching hearts, suicide, drinking problems, the break&hyphen;up of families and the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> collapse of self&hyphen;esteem. Is there no better way? William Butler Yeats, in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Second Coming</EMPHASIS>, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Things fall apart, the centre cannot hold.</PARA>
<PARA>I ask you: have the rules so changed that there is really no turning back? In these two houses of parliament we have members who belong to many different organisations. Some belong to the H.R. Nicholls Society. I want to quote from a submission at a public hearing on the new IR bill at which their representative said the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is ironic that these arbitral decisions are often justified in the name of social justice or fairness or equality, or some other weasel words.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say that fairness `is not a word that I think should be used in political discourse because it is empty of meaning'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I freely accept that you cannot ascribe these sentiments to all the members of this society. My purpose in quoting them is not just to register my profound shock that some of our most fundamental principles, ideals and ethics could be so publicly attacked by an organisation with some standing, but to indicate my concern that the public onslaught on our values has reached a very fundamental and deeply distressing level. It will be a sorry day for us when members on opposite sides of the political fence cannot even begin with a basic moral vocabulary that includes a common understanding of the word `fairness'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to have values. Economics and markets are largely value&hyphen;free. We have to draw a value line. The values that we need in government should firstly be civic and secondly managerial. We need the certainty and positivism that comes from commonly accepted values. People are more important than markets. I quote from Shakespeare's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Coriolanus</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What is the city but the people?</PARA>
<PARA>In an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">National Business Bulletin</EMPHASIS>  the notable West Australian Janet Holmes a Court has said that she was able to rescue her Heytesbury group because she focused on people. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it takes about three years to convince someone to get rid of the baggage that capital is more important than people . . . You don't ever see a line in a balance sheet for `people' and our bankers <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2836"> could never understand that there was a magic element which was unbudgetable in traditional accounting terms. If I had gone down the path recommended to me by our bankers, we would not have survived . . . it is the unbudgetability of the human factor. It is people who achieve things, not capital.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I hear the economists appointed by our mega media moguls extolling the latest sackings body count, I am reminded of journalists far from the battle. I think they should descend to the battlefield and smell the suicide, despair, loss of self-esteem and loss of hope before being quite so ready to laud and sanitise sackings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quotations, like statistics, can be twisted to suit the occasion. But the controversial philosopher Friedrich Nietzche said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we wish a change to be as radical as possible, we have to apply the remedy in small doses, but unremittingly, for long periods. Can a great action be accomplished all at once?</PARA>
<PARA>This can easily be regarded as the maxim of the long line of economic fundamentalist rationalists which Australia has been subject to&mdash;like communists who said that paradise was always after the next sacrifice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say that it is time to accept that we are not better off for many of those sacrifices. I say that it is time to have courage&mdash;to have the courage to be cautious; to have the courage to question the wisdom of those who have been leading us down a painful, largely value&hyphen;free and absolutely economic road; to have the courage to call for governments which offer more than a future of dirtier air and water, fewer trees and animals, fewer jobs but more millionaires, fewer opportunities and the slow but insistent draining away of hope. The whole of human history, of human endeavour, is founded on hope&mdash;a hope for a better future, for prosperity, contentment, inclusion, a golden age; a hope for knowledge and entitlement. Hope is what government should be about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make these remarks not because I believe that they will be heard but because this must be said. I feel that we are going through an era of tearing down, not building; of destroying, not creating. Change is being peddled without progress. We are moving from a political autumn to a political winter. That <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> may be fair enough, but what hope do you offer for a political spring?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For me, politics must be about hope. I believe that there is not one person here who does not understand the meaning of fairness, of justice and of hope. In this place, more than in just about any other, all of us daily get the chance to show our respect for these concepts. We get the chance to show our humanity. What I will try to keep before me throughout my time here is this belief: that, as divided as we may be, we all share in the goal of a better today and in the idea of a bright and magnificent future.</PARA>

<PARA>This report of the committee describes its history, practice and procedure from its establishment in 1966 to the commencement of the present parliament. The body of the report encompasses a brief history of privilege generally from 1901 and gives a thematic outline and evaluation of the committee's activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report is supplemented by a series of appendices, which consist of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 and its explanatory memorandum; the Senate privilege resolutions of 25 February 1988, with explanatory statements; a list of chairs, deputy chairs and members of the committee; an analysis of the committee's work since its establishment, together with a summary of committee reports and Senate action on each, and an index to the reports. To give maximum access to information contained in the report, the committee has arranged for it to be placed on the Internet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On behalf of the committee, I wish to pay special tribute to former Senator Baden Teague, who served as both chair and deputy chair of the committee and was a member of the committee from the passage of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 until his retirement on 30 June 1996; and also to former Senator John Coates, who spent a year on the committee from 1984 to 1985 and rejoined the committee in 1987. Senator Coates remained with the committee until his retirement yesterday. The committee believes that this present report is a timely recognition of their contribution to its work.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I was interrupted, I was speaking of buffer zones around airports. As an accident, a by-product of planning that occurred before ecological values were considered, the establishment of airport buffers was fortuitous. But we should not pretend that these areas can still be considered worthless bush or scrub. We no longer live in an era where natural vegetation is considered simply an impediment to development. Clearing land is no longer seen as a goal in itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today, these remnant areas are often the only surviving examples of the original ecology of the urban areas, the only remnant habitat of sometimes dozens of species that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2839"> have disappeared under concrete and lawn. Little areas caught between canals, within the fences of explosive reserves or around airports are often the only sites where various species are located: species of native grasses, bushes, wildflowers and trees once common in our urban areas. These buffer zones may be the only places they can now be found. Worms, lizards and all sorts of fauna are also found there, often uniquely, since their habitat has otherwise vanished. It could be fungi; it could be all those things that are not exactly warm, fuzzy animals; but they are important. Biologists are still discovering species in these urban pockets of natural land&mdash;species they never knew existed and which are now almost gone from the earth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe it was the intention of the previous government to simply forget these things: these fellow creatures that share our earth, these small remnants of what the biotic bounty of our cities once was. I sincerely hope it is not the intention of the current government to see these things as expendable, to be thrown away without consideration to put up yet another hotel or a parking lot, or to allow some company to make a few more dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I quote from the local newspaper in Western Australia in relation to airport developments: `Let's not let a tortoise get in the way of development.' I will be putting a few amendments that I think will at least ensure that these elements are considered so that there will be input into planning from those who care about these things and from those who know. I would like to point out that, as in Perth, it is often not the experts who know; it is often the local naturalists, the keen amateurs and the biology students who spend their spare hours over a period of years in these buffer zones, in the wetlands and along the riverbanks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The experts of the EPA are often far too busy to focus on such things. They do not have the time. Knowing an ecology is, in many respects, a labour of love. Knowledge of the principles of biological interaction cannot substitute for being close to the earth, a certain plot of earth, for learning its cycles and seasons and for becoming familiar with <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the life there. It is the same as the fact that knowing sociology or psychology cannot substitute for personal knowledge of the people of a community or of your own family. It is important that the plans which will affect our environment involve consultation with the people who do know the specifics of the earth in a place as well as consultation with experts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our amendments are fairly simple. The master plans and development plans currently include a requirement to note projected impacts of noise and to consider and note all potential environmental impacts. We would amend the requirements so that these impacts are not just noted but that the proponents would have to include a strategy to address these impacts. It is not enough to simply note that these things are likely to happen&mdash;that is, that we will ruin the wetlands. Accountability demands management plans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The noise issue is particularly important. With the environmental impacts, these are, to some extent, covered in the environmental strategy. But in the environmental strategy in division 3, concerning what may be regulated in terms of environmental standards, the phrase in 124(1)(b) that `the emission of noise generated at airport sites (other than noise generated by aircraft in flight)' creates an implication that environmental management involves only the site of the airport, at least in regard to noise and possibly in regard to other things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The major issue regarding noise is about residents and about `noise generated by aircraft in flight'. If this is not to be considered in the environmental strategy, then it must be considered in the context of the master plan and development plans. In fact, it is to be considered in the current bill, but there are no provisions for plans about how to manage or address the problem. Also, as noted below, there are no penalties for contravention of the environmental strategy, while there are requirements under section 76 for bringing a problem with achieving objectives of the master plan to the attention of the minister, and penalties for failing to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The lack of a requirement for plans for management of noise is a serious omission. It <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2840"> is particularly serious considering that previously the government response to a government owned and operated airport has been to try to insulate residential houses under the flight path to reduce the noise exposure inside the houses. Such a plan cost millions of dollars and the results were far from satisfactory, with the government arguing that they would insulate the bedrooms but not living spaces such as kitchens and dining rooms. What is supposed to happen in future? If a private manager makes decisions or changes that result in unacceptable levels of noise, who decides what is to be done? Who will pay? Will government subsidise the airport lessees? Will residents simply be sacrificed? There is really no provision in the current bill for dealing with this at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Among other things, we seek to alter the environmental regulations section to allow regulations regarding noise from airborne aircraft. The regulations are optional; they may be drafted. A regulation in relation to aircraft noise may be nothing other than a regulation requiring that the forecast required for the master and land use plans must include profiles for noise impact broken down by time and neighbourhood.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also concerned that there can be alterations to land use that do not fit under the definition of a major development, yet which create a substantial environmental impact. For example, part of a minor development may include drainage that affects water levels in a significant wetland. The development may cost less than $10 million and so not require a change to the land use plan nor a change to the master plan or environmental strategy, yet it will have a clear impact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both the master plan and environmental strategy are to be replaced every five years but may just continue in operation beyond the five&hyphen;year period if a replacement is not approved. Under section 122(2), contravention of the environmental plan is not an offence. Under 122(3), it does not affect the validity of an agreement though it may be grounds for an injunction. The only place which might require an examination of the new project is under state law or under the development plan. This is why we have included a new <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> category stating that a development proposal having substantive impact on the environment is as much a major development as an extension of a runway. I do not believe it is the intention of parliament that a development having a significant environmental impact should be free of scrutiny just because the cause of the impact was not monetarily expensive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will also seek to clarify the situation with regard to federal environmental regulations and state or territory regulations. Initially we were told that the Airports Bill guaranteed a high degree of environmental accountability. We were told that airports would not be exempted from state and territory environmental law but that, where state law was too lenient or exceptions were made by state legislature, the federal government could put even more stringent regulations in place. The fairly explicit impression I got was that this was to be a system of double safeguards, that airports would be under both state or territory and federal environmental regulations and would have to comply with the most stringent requirements. I am fairly confident that this was the ALP's intention&mdash;they may tell me otherwise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed law does not say that. It says that airports must abide by both state or territory and federal regulations but that federal regulations take precedence in a conflict and further that federal regulations may exempt airports from state or territory law. We have amendments to change this and bring the law in line with what I believe was the original intention of the ALP&mdash;and what I hope is the intention of the coalition&mdash;that the most stringent measures at either government level should be applied in the protection of the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, the regulations themselves should, I believe, be able to include regulation of impact on habitat and biota. I remind senators that no regulations need be made, and so this simply creates an option to regulate these environmental impacts. The current legislation says that regulations can only deal with pollution, noise and waste, and only at the airport site, yet these are not the only environmental impacts that are likely.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2841">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also believe that, like the plans and strategies, regulations should be made with consultation. It is important to get the input from various sources about what regulations may be appropriate and about any potential problems with regulations. Given the importance of regulations, it also seems an important element of accountability that they should be tabled in parliament as disallowable instruments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said initially, I think it was the intention of the ALP that stringent regulation for environmental protection should apply and that the regulatory regime and development plans for the airports should involve broad consultation. I hope the coalition would agree. If the people are to lose some input, then it is important that they do not lose all input into the impacts of airport development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think my amendments strengthen this accountability and responsiveness without unduly compromising the companies that will probably run airports. I wish that this bill not be passed, and I will vote against it. But since it is likely to be carried by the opposition and the government, it should be in a form as responsible and responsive as possible.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak on the Airports Bill 1996 and the Airports (Transitional) Bill 1996. Both these bills aid the privatisation and the sale of the leases on the airports held by the Federal Airports Corporation at the present time. I do not wish to canvass the detail of the bills other than in a very superficial sense because that has been dealt with by previous speakers on this side.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I want to do is review the operation of the Federal Airports Corporation in the six to eight years it has been in existence, as its existence is clearly now drawing to a close, and to highlight the very great conceptual failures that led the Labor government to set up both the Federal Airports Corporation and what was the Civil Aviation Authority before it got broken up further under the guise or the concept of GBEs, government business enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> A GBE is a very fine sounding title, but in practice, administratively, it has been one of the great failures of Australian public admin istration. At the end of the day it has been a failure simply because there was no accountability or negligible accountability built into the system. It is all very well to talk about having discrete bodies, government business enterprises, but they did have great power&mdash;and, in the case of the FAC, it had both power and economic power&mdash;and they really did not have to account for the exercise of that power to anyone at all. In the case of both the FAC and the CAA they were monopoly powers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They were set up to be self&hyphen;regulating authorities. The concept was generally based on the belief of user pays, which was quite fashionable in the Labor government, particularly in its earlier years. It is a fair enough proposition in a very broad sense to talk about user pays and about not being a burden on the rest of society, but in the case of these two authorities&mdash;the Civil Aviation Authority, as it was then, and the Federal Airports Corporation&mdash;there is a demonstrable public interest and a public benefit from those authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You cannot attribute the entire cost of an airport or of the regulation of the airways services to the passengers or to the freight that is carried by the airlines. There is a genuine public interest and the public benefits by those transport facilities, by the development of commerce and all that flows from it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other great problem with the user&hyphen;pays concept in this dimension is that the user literally had no control over the expenditure. There is no requirement on the people providing the service to provide it in the most efficient and, therefore, the most economic form.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The belief was that, if the government business enterprises were set up, they could be self&hyphen;funding. Not only would that lower taxation to the community at large, which of course never happened, but also there was the belief that, because they were called business enterprises, they would be run more efficiently than when they were departments of state and that thereby costs would be made lower to the users&mdash;namely, the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In actual fact all we saw was a great explosion of costs. Costs to the aviation industry <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2842"> have gone up as a consequence of the introduction of the CAA and the Federal Airports Corporation in 1986, when the legislation was passed by the then transport minister Gareth Evans. The regrettable point is that it does not matter what happens from now on, those high costs are now built into the aviation industry. It will be impossible to get them back to a more equitable figure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of the Federal Airports Corporation, it was argued that, in the light of experience overseas, particularly the experience in Europe and the United Kingdom, privatisation of airports had been a great commercial success for the authorities that were administering them. That was perfectly true, but there are some significant differences between the European or the United Kingdom experience and Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First of all, in places like Belgium, Holland and London there is great pressure on land. Land is a very scarce resource. If you have a huge area tied up for an airport which has only runways and hangars on it, you are wasting a valuable resource. Given the high population densities around there, it was quite an attractive proposition commercially to develop the land that was not being used for aviation purposes but which was required in any case to enclose runways and hangars for commercial services. That yielded a great benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That argument is not quite transferable to Australia. As someone who has had a long involvement with the aviation industry, I agree that there is a lot of waste land and a waste of resource in all the airports we have in Australia. If we can use that profitably to reduce the costs and the overheads of the airports, I am more than happy to do that. But you have to remember that airports have certain characteristics. They are there for aircraft to operate on and off. They do have a lot of noise associated with them, regrettably. You do need a certain amount of space for aircraft to land and take off. Those requirements for the operation of aircraft must have primacy over any other commercial development which takes place on the airfield site.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trouble started with the Federal Airports Corporation right at the outset, because <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Labor Party in their usual style were quite dishonest when it came to finance. All the airports in Australia had been paid for by the Australian taxpayers&mdash;some of them going back to the 1930s and possibly earlier in one or two other occasions. Not only were they paid for by the taxpayer but their value had been depreciated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead of gifting them to the Federal Airports Corporation, which would have been the correct thing for them to do, they valued them at top dollar at the time as prime development land, transferred that notional value across to the FAC and said, `We will loan you the money to buy these facilities. Furthermore, we require you to pay a high rate of dividend as a return for the nominal value that we have placed on those airports.' So the FAC got off to a very bad start and, in many ways, a totally unrealistic load was placed on them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that sense the management plan was quite wrong. The effect of that has been to build this huge multiplier effect into the overheads of airports, which impacts on Australia's competitiveness internationally. I will give an example of this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For many years I have been operating out of Archerfield, the secondary airport in Brisbane. When the old Department of Civil Aviation operated the airfields that the DCA owned in Australia, there was a small planning staff in Canberra. I do not how many were in it&mdash;maybe half a dozen or a dozen engineers who understood the requirements of airfield civil engineering and air traffic control. They planned what was required for the whole of Australia. All the airports around the country were each manned by probably two or three groundsmen, with two groundsmen for most of the secondary airports. They were people who mowed the grass. Development works, like sealing runways and construction, went out to contractors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As soon as the FAC was set up not only did we have a huge expansion&mdash;dozens more people moved into the central planning authority, with very high salaries for the senior personnel&mdash;but we got these huge teams on every airport they control in Australia. Archerfield has maybe 10 or 12 people&mdash; <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2843">all with very high executive salaries, all with fine titles, such as business manager, development manager, engineering manager, promotions manager and so on. I presume all of them are getting at least $60,000 to $80,000 a year and have new cars with mobile phones and radios. That is an overhead that secondary airports simply cannot bear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you take on the FAC about the fact they are losing money on these airports, they say that they are losing $500,000 or $1 million on X, Y and Z and the only airports they are really making money out of are the primary airports at Brisbane, Sydney and Tullamarine. The reason they are losing money on the others is that they are carrying these absurd overheads that simply cannot be supported.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I declare a personal interest because I am a tenant of the FAC. I have had the unfortunate experience of having to deal with them since they have been in power. I do say quite seriously that they have abused the monopoly powers that were granted to them. Aircraft can be operated only from airfields. They cannot be operated from industrial land, residential land or anything like that. If you live in a capital city, you are obliged to operate from the secondary airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The FAC have abused their monopolistic power by being quite unable or unprepared to negotiate on any reasonable terms with their tenants. I originally signed a contract with the old Department of Civil Aviation for a hangar that a group of us had built. That was fairly represented in a lease agreement that took 10 pages. It represented the interests of the tenant and the landlord.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When that lease expired, we were given a 50&hyphen;page lease agreement from the FAC. Every page of that document was marked and overprinted with the slogan `For discussion purposes only'. When we came to discuss this 50&hyphen;page document, which listed every conceivable event and incident which could befall the FAC and protected them and gave no rights to the tenant at all, we met a brick wall. We were told, `It's non-negotiable. You sign or else.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real sticking point of course was the rent. The rent went up very many times. A <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tenant simply has no negotiating power with a monopoly landlord who is behaving in this manner. The rental rate was several times that of comparable industrial land over the street. The industrial land over the street is worthless to us. We cannot operate there. We have to operate off the airport. Arguably, we ought to pay a lower rate than that for comparable industrial land rather than pay two or three times the rate for commercial land on the perimeter of the airports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the day we are in a position where we just have to give in to the FAC. They very clearly have abused their position and the monopoly powers they have over their tenants. They take one tenant aside and say in private that someone else is paying a certain rate for the rental of a certain property&mdash;this is usually someone who has a burning desire to get onto the airfield and knows nothing about the history of it&mdash;and, having signed up that person, they then use that as a lever against everyone else with the proviso that, if you do not sign the lease, you take your hangar and return the land to its original condition or they seize your hangar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are legally entitled to do that, but it is a pretty draconian way to go about it. It overlooks the fact that some tenants who are on those airports came there under a totally different regime when they dealt with the Department of Civil Aviation. You simply cannot pull down a hangar, dig up six inches of concrete and go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The way the FAC has gone about this has led to a great flight of people from the secondary airports. That is socially undesirable because the community must have a resource that is an airport. If you do have a designated airport, you can control noise, you can define your approach and departure paths, and you can have a degree of environmental control, which is impossible if people are operating out of a whole lot of small airports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other very important point is that it aggregates pilots, maintenance people and aircraft in the one site, which makes oversight and regulation of them very much easier. It becomes very difficult for the regulatory authority if they have to chase after tiny backyard airports all over the place to try to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2844"> find out who is up to speed on their maintenance and what operating practices might be. So there are very real social benefits in setting up these secondary airports around the capital areas and running them in an economically efficient way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have gotten to the position now where all governments see that the name of the game is to maximise the profits from the sale of the airports. So we have the FAC embarking on an even more rabid rental rise program. Everyone would have seen in the last two to three weeks that Qantas and Ansett had refused to even discuss with the FAC the 13 per cent plus rise that it was trying to put onto their lease agreements. The name of the game is to build incomes up as high as they can for the airports so that the government can maximise the sale price of the airports. The other side of that is that you are building in costs to the industry which are going to be permanent. It neglects the original concept, which was to provide a lowering of cost to industry&mdash;not to increase them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The difficulty with all of this is that there simply is no accountability. There is no way you could bring the FAC to account; they were a law unto themselves. The minister has minimal control legally over them and any complaints are met with a deaf ear. I think it is very undesirable in society to have a group with monopoly power&mdash;let alone monopoly economic power&mdash;which is not accountable effectively to shareholders, only its own board of directors. That has been the great problem with the FAC. Hopefully, though, they will ride off into the pages of history in the next year or two.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we are still left with the business of what happens to the CAA. It is time we had a look at the CAA, which has now been split into the Civil Aviation and Safety Authority, CASA, Airservices Australia&mdash;looking after the air traffic control procedures&mdash;and BASI, which is a bit of an outrider unit and does not quite fit into the category of the other two. I think that Airservices Australia in some way can be privatised. It is very difficult to get competition into the provision of air traffic control services, and I do not wish to take the time of the Senate tonight going into that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> because the whip was trying to wind me up about five minutes ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a very cogent argument for CASA to be returned as a department of state to this parliament under the control of a minister. CASA really is a regulatory authority and therefore is a policeman. I do not see police forces being privatised or run as government business enterprises. Their role is to ensure the safe navigation of aircraft and the safe operation of aircraft in Australia. They exist to form regulations and see that those regulations are applied. Their role is very similar to a police force and I think the concept of them staying as a government business enterprise is no longer tenable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not expect my own government to fall over and accept this proposition straightaway, but I do think we have to seriously look at that. In the end that authority has to be brought back into the parliament because it has a well defined role and it ought to be accountable to the parliament and a minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope those few words have not impeded the passage of the Airports (Transitional) Bill 1996 and the Airports Bill 1996, because in general they provide worthwhile amendments to the proposed sale. I hope different authorities buy the two major airports in Brisbane and in Melbourne, because in the interest of competition within the states we ought to have a competitive game running between all the major airports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point is that it is highly desirable that in Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne the primary airport and the secondary airport are linked together and operated together&mdash;that the purchaser of the primary airport should also buy the secondary airport so that one can support the other, because there is a very genuine need to have cooperation between those two.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I begin my contribution in this debate by thanking Senator Murphy for allowing me to speak at this time, because I have an important engagement at 6 o'clock which I could not break. He has left the chamber, but I am sure the duty minister for the Labor Party will pass the message on that I do appreciate the fact. Also, this is the first <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2845"> opportunity I have had to congratulate Senator Murray on his first speech in this place today. I had the privilege of being involved with his first foray into Senate work in terms of the committee we were on last week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to clear up a point with regard to the altercation which unfortunately occurred this morning between Senator Conroy and me; I do not believe it should have done, nonetheless it did. I want to put on the record the situation which exists as far as Sydney is concerned and our going or not going up there. We had one submission from New South Wales which was in on time, which was from the Bankstown City Council. They came to Canberra and appeared. We had a second submission from the Sutherland council. It was a late submission and they asked whether or not we would take it into consideration. They were the two submissions we had from New South Wales. We did not get a submission from the New South Wales government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another point I want to clear up so that the matter is absolutely clear is that, in relation to Melbourne, this morning I may have inadvertently led people to believe that the representative of the Victorian government wanted to appear but did not appear. I want to make it absolutely clear that, while the Victorian government put in a submission, they expressly said that they did not wish to appear before the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In dealing with this legislation before us, I am going to deal with the inquiries we had and the response to some matters, because some very important matters were raised during those hearings and it is important that I refer to them briefly in the time I have. The first point I wish to make&mdash;and it is very important in terms of the committee hearing&mdash;is that prior to the hearing the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee received, through a letter to me as chairman of that committee, the additional amendments that the minister had. So the witnesses who were there were familiar with them and able to deal with them in a formal manner. I am pleased to say that the recommendation from the committee reads:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the Airports Bill 1996 and the Airports (Transitional) Bill 1996 be agreed to subject to amendments notified to the Committee by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development.</PARA>
<PARA>So we agreed on those aspects of it. I also note that at the end of that hearing Senator Conroy congratulated the committee for adopting what he called the amendments from the opposition in the other place. But they were more than amendments from the opposition in the other place. Whilst I acknowledge that they were moved there, they were positions also put by a number in the community including&mdash;I am not 100 per cent certain about this&mdash;the Victorian and New South Wales governments about the situation that existed. I see Senator Conroy is nodding about them both.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We dealt with other important matters and we heard from every witness who wished to appear before us. Other than the submissions that I have mentioned, there was one other but the witness did not wish to appear. So we did not get a large response in terms of people wishing to give evidence either through submissions without appearing or by appearing. But the important thing about this inquiry was that the submissions went straight to the point. They were very important and the committee took on board the aspects raised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another recommendation was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the Minister raise with the Minister for Finance the need to ensure selection processes take into account the broader development and economic concerns of the States, Territories and Local Government.</PARA>
<PARA>I think it is fair to say that the Western Australian government, the South Australian government, the Bankstown Council and the conglomerate of councils from Tasmania all put that aspect to the committee and I am pleased to say that the minister has taken that recommendation on board. It demonstrates quite clearly the value of the hearings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next recommendation states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further, the Committee recommends that the Government establish clear consultative processes with the States, Territories and Local Government.</PARA>
<PARA>It is fair to say that once again all the witnesses were concerned about the consultative <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2846"> process. They were concerned that it was not clearly spelt out, although they did not really criticise the communications to this point. They were concerned about the future, the leasing program and what was occurring. We put that recommendation to the minister and, once again, the minister has accepted it and is prepared to implement that in a practical way. We as a committee will obviously be interested in the outcome and will continue to monitor it. I am sure that those councils and the state, territory and local governments will all remind us, as time goes by, if it is not implemented, but I have no doubt from the discussions that I have had with the minister's office that it will be implemented and that that is the intention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next recommendation was raised by all the witnesses, and I have to say that this is the only inquiry on which I have sat and on which there has been a consistency of theme from all the witnesses. The recommendation states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also recommends that the Minister regulate to ensure that non&hyphen;aeronautical business activities are consistent with State, Territory and local Government planning and trading laws.</PARA>
<PARA>I had some personal experience on this issue because of what almost occurred at the Perth airport at Guildford approximately 18 months to two years ago. There was a proposal, which nearly saw the light of day, to build a shopping centre at the airport. It would have been operating in competition with the various businesses around the airport but under a totally different set of trading rules which, as I understand it, would have severely disadvantaged those shops and shopping centres outside of the airport. It did not proceed because of the community outrage. We were also given other examples of real concern. The minister has recognised this as a problem and once again he has been quite happy to make sure that there is consistency in what occurs with non&hyphen;aeronautical activity on both sides of the fence, if you like.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee drew the minister's attention to a number of concerns raised by the airlines. There is no doubt that the airlines themselves have a vested interest in the outcome of this leasing program, but one has to recognise <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that, having serviced the Australian public for a long time, they do have some rights. We have drawn to the minister's attention the concerns that they raised. A number of these have been dealt with in the report that we put down today and they are included in a letter from, I think, the department which deals with consultation, critical national issues, domestic terminal leases, et cetera. I will not read them all out&mdash;it is in the back of the report&mdash;but I make the point that, once again, we have had a positive response from the minister to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With this legislation, as far as the arrangements into the future for the leasing of the airports and the development of policies are concerned, I believe we now have a very sound policy position and one that will be great for Australia and its capital cities into the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I emphasise one thing, which came out in the state government submissions and the submissions from the councils in Tasmania. They put a lot of emphasis, because of the development of air travel, tourism and commercial development&mdash;once again I use an example from my state of the development of commercial products, chilled goods into Asia&mdash;on the necessity to have a coordinated Commonwealth&hyphen;state approach based on consultation. The hearings that were held were very fruitful and helpful to the government in consolidating a policy position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank all the witnesses for their contributions. It would be remiss of me if I did not thank the departmental officers, and Senator Tambling as the parliamentary secretary there on that day. A lot of information was put on the public record and it was a classic example of how the committee system should work to improve a situation. Most of that improvement was in getting an understanding of the proposition rather than in changing anything.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(6.00 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to address my remarks on the Airports Bill specifically to regional airports because they are of such significance in my home state. With regard to the question of selling the remaining FAC airports, there has always been, I think, a fairly diverse view within the Australian Labor Party about the sale or leasing of airports. They are a very <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2847"> successful public asset and they have worked, in the main, very well&mdash;save for some of the regional airports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One thing that has always bothered me with regard to the FAC has been its investment strategy in so far as it has a very clear focus on the large airports and somewhat of a much lesser focus on what to do with the regional airports. I say that again in relation to my own state in particular. If I were of a view to support the leasing or the sale of those public assets, it would be on the basis that I thought that our airports in Tasmania could do much better under local ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That brings me to this question of the local ownership. When we were in government, two community groups were set up, once the decision had been taken to lease the FAC airports. There was a concern about people in Tasmania not wanting those airports to fall under the control of private ownership&mdash;and for very good reason. So we in government agreed to a study taking place to allow the community to ascertain whether the local ownership or the local leasing of the airports by the local authorities would be or could be successful and whether or not the financial capacity of those airports would be such as to not be a financial drain on the community. In government we provided some $200,000 for that study to proceed. Mind you, I would have to say, the people that did the study, in my view, did not do a very good job and, in some respects, I think the money that was used was somewhat sadly wasted because we did have to proceed to get some further analysis done of exactly what the capacity of the airports might be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We went on down that road to give a very firm indication to the Tasmanian community that, should they desire to take control of their airports in Hobart and Launceston, we would be granting those airports to the communities basically free of charge and also free of debt. We carried a resolution at our national conference in 1994 that also committed the ALP in government to the establishment of a development fund. What happened was that we rolled along the road towards a federal election and when the question was put&mdash;and I participated on both committees, in the north and south of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the state&mdash;to the two parties, the coalition agreed and indicated very firmly that they would do exactly the same as what had been promised by the then Labor government, should they win government. We know that on 2 March they did win government, and we also know that they have now reneged&mdash;in fact, ratted&mdash;on what they told the Tasmanian public with respect to the two airports in Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just want to read out a few paragraphs from a speech made by the now Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on 26 March to the Business Council of Australia. In part, he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the reasons why the respect for our institutions has declined is the way in which promises are too freely made and even more freely repudiated after governments are elected to power.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think part of the process of restoring trust and confidence in the process . . . is for governments to try to the best of their ability, and even beyond that if that's possible, to meet the commitments that they have made. And I have indicated to my colleagues and I have indicated publicly, and I will go on indicating it publicly, that nobody should imagine that I will lightly accept any repudiation of the commitments that we made to people. And even more important than other benchmarks against which you are entitled to judge us, in three years time you will be entitled to judge us according to the benchmark of whether or not we have honoured commitments made to people and to the Australian nation before the 2nd of March because unless that stream of trust, that element of confidence, can be restored, then the whole respect of the community for the political process and for the process of government is going to further disintegrate.</PARA>
<PARA>I think it is a great few paragraphs. I totally agree with them, but the problem is that the Prime Minister and his government now have lost sight of them altogether.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is particularly the case with respect to Tasmania because this ratting exercise does not relate only to the airports. The Australian Maritime College is a very important piece of infrastructure in the Bass electorate, in which Mr Warwick Smith, the member of the House of Representatives, was re&hyphen;elected at the last election. We gave a funding commitment to the college for the development of a new cooperative research centre, a hydrodynamic <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2848"> facility. The commitment was $14&half; million. Overall, the development would have had a total cost of around $17 million and would have provided, during its construction and initial operation, a significant boost to the local economy in terms of employment, small business and services. And yet what has the government done? It has withdrawn that funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Tasmanian state Liberal government also gave the Australian Maritime College $500,000, a fair amount of which was used in boring a test hole. They also put in place joint arrangements with other countries on the basis of that development proceeding, but John Howard's actions have left them with egg on their face. Of course, it does not stop there either. Also affected are the university through the better cities program and the redevelopment of the Inveresk railyards in Launceston in Warwick Smith's electorate of Bass.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following the election I remember reading an article by Mr Michael Courtney in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Examiner</EMPHASIS> saying that the people of Bass had been smart in electing a member of government in 1993 and doing so again in 1996, and he mentioned the significant benefits that having a member of government had delivered to Bass. I am sure he would like to withdraw those comments now, but of course he will not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I noticed the other day that Launceston airport was so important to the new minister, Mr Sharp, that he organised a meeting with the PLA on Flinders Island. Of course, he did not tell anyone else&mdash;nobody else knew. He said, `We're very much in favour of local ownership, but we will put those airports up for sale to the highest bidder.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The community itself will not have the capacity to raise the necessary finance either to buy an airport or to compete against some other major bidders. In this legislation the government proposes allowing the clustering of airports so that somebody will be able to buy Melbourne airport and Hobart and Launceston airports. We propose an amendment to that which I hope the government members in this Senate from Tasmania will support.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recall Senator Abetz not that long ago on another issue, namely, woodchip export licences, saying he expected Labor senators to cross the floor and vote with the government in the interests of Tasmania. I challenge Senator Abetz and his colleagues to do the same. If you expect that from us, then we can rightly expect the same from you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I listened to Mr Chris Miles on ABC radio this morning talk about the labour market program cuts and the effective shifting of money into the modern apprenticeship training scheme, MATS. In Tasmania there has been a decline in big industry where apprenticeships are normally found. There is no investment on the horizon for our state to put people into apprenticeships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The labour market program funding that we had in operation when we were in government provided the only employment generation in Tasmania. Many thousands of people now have real jobs&mdash;not apprenticeships&mdash;earning real money and paying real taxes. An organisation did a survey of the Tasmanian experience which indicated there was a net economic benefit after three years to the government in the use of labour market programs, even though some of them were not as successful as others. No way will MATS work in my state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Miles said, `But a major shipbuilder is having trouble getting trained people.' Mr Miles did not say, `By the way, we also scrapped the shipbuilding bounty' and Mr Clifford has now said, `That is exactly what you will do. You will wipe out that shipbuilding for Hobart.'</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What else you have done in terms of transport for tourists to Tasmania is cut the passenger equalisation subsidy by 50 per cent. Either you are admitting that you clearly lied in opposition prior to the election by putting out figures saying it would be $12 million in the first year, $17.5 million in the second year and $22 million in the third year&mdash;based on the figures that TT&hyphen;Line gave you&mdash;or you knew that you were never going to apply it to a fare structure where people could get $150 one way. For your information, Senator Calvert, the only way under the current fare structure that you could get $150 going one way on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Spirit of Tasmania</EMPHASIS> is if you stopped in the top two classes of accommodation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In your budget yesterday you cut that amount by 50 per cent. That indicates that you either blatantly lied to the Tasmanian people or you cocked it up so badly that you really had no idea what you were doing anyway so you thought, `$49&half; million is a bit more than the $44 million ferry that the Labor <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Party promised, so $49&half; million will sound better to the people and that will con them.' Well, I have to agree that you did con them. It got you into government but, by God, a lot of Tasmanian people must be absolutely kicking themselves for ever voting for you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, airports are a vital asset in Tasmania. It is paramount that we get those airports under local control so they can be operated in the best interests of the Tasmanian community. If we do not, if they are sold to private interests and operated purely on the basis of being profit machines, there will be a real possibility that one of those airports will close. Senator Calvert might think that it is not such a bad idea, particularly if it was Launceston airport, but it would be a disaster for the north of the state. We have a real potential to see some industries, particularly in the agricultural and horticultural areas, develop. If we had a better state government that might happen all the more quickly. But the airport will be essential to our ability to transport those things out of the state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I again urge and implore my Tasmanian government colleagues to stand up and fight for our state and ensure that the Prime Minister allows the granting of those airports to the two local bodies that have sought to take control of them. I urge you, if for no reason other than that you have an obligation because you told the voters you would do it and you should not be allowed to get away with ratting on them.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are indeed trustees of the people's property and we are answerable to the people in the states who have put us here to use this property wisely. There are arguments that the private management of assets such as airports <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2850"> may improve operational efficiency. However, it is important to remember, as I have pointed out previously in the Senate, that airports are in fact strategic natural monopolies. It is important that we do not sell off natural monopolies to anyone who is then left free to charge whatever the market will bear. To do that would be to legislate for a new breed of robber barons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously, to give away natural monopolies with no system of regulation or control of pricing is the equivalent of tax farming&mdash;it is selling a licence to tax the travelling public for a lump sum fee. It is just like Tudor or Stewart Kings raising revenue by selling patents of monopoly or the French monarchy letting out tax farming contracts before the revolution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indirect taxes levied through the abuse of monopoly rights are among the worst of all taxes. More than once I have pointed out that there is an inherent conflict between the economic efficiency arguments for putting airports under private management and the revenue maximisation objectives of selling to the highest bidder.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was pleased when the original objective of selling airports outright was abandoned in favour of a leasing system. At least that is something, although I am cautious about that. Actually I am inclined to vote against this particular measure for a number of reasons, which I will give later. At least it is better now that it is a leasing system. A leasing system allows the Commonwealth to impose by contract, as a condition of the lease, the incorporation of a regulatory and pricing oversight regime which can in theory at least limit abuse of monopoly power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like the government to consider what I say with respect to this matter. Unless care is exercised in this regard, the Commonwealth could find itself in the position that any attempt to prevent unjustified charges could be attacked by airport lessees as a constitutionally prohibited unjust acquisition of property.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I therefore ask the parliamentary secretary who is representing the minister to deal with this matter in his response to the second reading debate or at least in the committee <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> stage of the debate. I ask him to assure the Senate that all leases will contain specific provisions subjecting the lessee to whatever pricing and regulatory regime the parliament may enact from time to time. It is crucial that parliament insists upon and retains the right to exercise oversight of regulatory and pricing regimes which prevent any abuse of monopoly power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the figures that have been touted in the financial press as to the value of some of the airports&mdash;and it does appear that Tullamarine, for example, will be a real bottler&mdash;I am concerned that some bidders may be proceeding on the assumption that they will be allowed to charge the airlines and the travelling public what the market will bear. I would like to see any such notion firmly disabused.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some time ago I did ask the previous minister for a copy of the scoping study detailing the value of the airports. I was interested in whether the values being placed on airports were being manufactured on an assumption of disguised monopolistic charges. The opposition might be interested to know&mdash;because they probably do not know what happened&mdash;that the previous minister did not choose to give that study to the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Personally, I have some difficulty with the concept that parliament should be disposing of any public asset without a firm understanding as to how the value is derived. However, others in this chamber seem to be more relaxed about this particular difficulty. Unless, therefore, there is support for pressing this question, I do not intend to delay the chamber by further discussing this matter, but I simply note that, for one, I find it unsatisfactory that a trustee of public assets could be expected to dispose of them without full information as to what they are worth. In principle, I think it is wrong, but I can do no more than state my view and hope that the parliamentary secretary responds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning to my own state of Tasmania, as I have said on previous occasions Tasmania is uniquely situated amongst the founding states of the Commonwealth. We are, as you all know, an island state, and we know it only too well. Any cost imposed upon aviation, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2851"> whether through fuel charges, aviation regulations or airport charges, is a threat to the prosperity and wellbeing of Tasmania. It is therefore essential for Tasmanians to be reassured by the government that proper oversight will be maintained on freight and passenger charges levied on all airports, and Tasmanian airports in particular.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, if the object of this exercise is to ensure that airports are placed in the hands of those who can best manage them to the advantage of the communities they serve, I would like to see some assurance from the government that preference will be given to applications from states or local communities to take over federally run airports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will also seek assurances for the parliament&mdash;and I seek them now&mdash;that airports will be fully subjected to local government regulations and local government taxation, and that these requirements will be explicitly incorporated into leases signed by the Commonwealth with any lessee of any airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to go back a little to something that I said a moment ago about the airports being placed in certain hands. I want to take as an example the Launceston and Hobart airports. In the current regime those airports are cross&hyphen;subsidised by the FAC. I think, taking all things into consideration, Hobart is run at a loss of about half a million dollars a year. Obviously, the second tranche will affect that airport. I realise that the immediate matter relates to the first tranche, but we are dealing with a bill which has principles which will apply to the second tranche. That is one of the major reasons I am concerned about this particular measure.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Margetts correctly points out, this is the only bill we are going to get, and the rest will be dealt with by regulation. That is an interesting aspect, is it not? Regulations can always be overturned, but one of the problems is that we might deal with specific matters the overturning of which could cause more problems than there were originally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is why I think it is so important&mdash;and this is what I think Senator Margetts is getting at; she really dealt with the issue thoroughly, I believe, in her speech&mdash;that we get it right. I am inclined, as she is, and she said so in her speech, to vote against the measure. It is obvious that the government and the opposition jointly are going to support the bill irrespective of what happens. We have a second reading amendment moved by the opposition, but that is not placing things in the bill. The opposition is still going to vote for the measure, as I understand it. The opposition is going to vote with the government. Irrespective of what Senator Margetts, the Democrats, Senator Brown, Senator Colston or I do, the thing will go through. That will not be so, of course, when it comes to regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me put it this way: if this particular measure results in a situation whereby the Launceston and Hobart airports are sold to the highest bidder, and that bidder then exploits the situation of Tasmanians and charges passenger and freight rates on the basis of what the market will bear, that is totally inappropriate, particularly in a situation of a state like Tasmania, which relies very heavily on travel across Bass Strait by air&mdash;whether it be business travel or private travel by people seeing their relations on the mainland, perhaps visiting sick relations, going to funerals or whatever. There is also, of course, the important freight travel. I think Senator Calvert and Senator Murphy referred to some of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my view, if the principles in this measure are going to result in the lease going to the highest bidder who will charge what the market will bear, that is totally inappropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did say that I do acknowledge that one of the government representatives at the meeting of the rural and regional affairs and transport committee on 6 August responded to questions that were raised by Senator Calvert and me in respect of the submission that was made by the Hobart Metropolitan Councils Association.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Hobart Metropolitan Councils Association made a very good submission. It was represented at the hearing by Terry Martin, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2852"> the Mayor of the City of Glenorchy; Greg Alomes, the manager of that city; and Mr Michael Catchpole. Those witnesses put forward the belief of the Hobart Metropolitan Councils Association that the Commonwealth, in granting to a regionally representative group the lease over the Hobart airport, should ensure that the airport is transferred debt free, at no cost and with the provision of a one-off capital grant for essential maintenance and upgrading, under a similar form of ownership to the ALOP&mdash;that is, the aerodrome local ownership plan&mdash;and to a lessee which has no ownership interests in any other airport. The latter matter, of course, has been dealt with by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was interested to see the responses or indications that were given by one of the representatives of the department before that hearing in respect of these matters. But they were only indications. Obviously, given the clauses in the bill, they could be no more than indications. I would like those indications to be set firm in concrete. In answer to a question of mine, the department did agree that the current ALOP arrangements in various airports, including those in Burnie and Devonport, were working quite well; in other words, the community organisations that operate those particular airports are going well and are managing those airports very well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is important in Australia is both who manages these particular assets and how they manage them. It is clear that they are being managed well under the ALOP system. It is also important that they are provided with essential public services at the least possible cost, and that the travelling public are provided with these. It is particularly important in our state, given the Bass Strait situation, that the travelling public should be provided with the services at the least possible cost and not be exposed to the risk of monopoly gouging. No senator representing any state, certainly not an island state, can possibly accept any bill which exposes his or her constituents to the threat of commercial extortion on the grounds of geographical disadvantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, I will be looking in the committee stage of the bill for explicit assurances from the minister on the points I have raised. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> However, if the minister can give those assurances on those particular matters now, I look forward to hearing from him. In short, I am not inclined to vote for the measure as it stands, but no doubt we will be revisiting it tomorrow during the committee stage.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is indeed a pity that Senator Conroy, as a new whip in this place, is obviously trying to find his own way through, on his own mettle, in judging various issues. The fact is that this morning, when the Senate was considering a committee report on this very important matter, it became obvious that Senator Conroy stuffed up. At that point, a number of issues were taken against him, and it is notable also that he has been removed from the Labor Party speakers list on this particular bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to refer to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee report into the Airports Bill 1996 and the Airports (Transitional) Bill 1996. The government welcomes that report. In particular, I would like to compliment the chairman, Senator Crane, members of the committee and the committee secretariat for the Senate committee's comprehensive and timely response to the matters raised. The government notes that the committee has recommended that, on its introduction into the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Airports Bill 1996 and the Airports (Transitional) Bill 1996 be agreed to subject to amendments notified to the Committee by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development.</PARA>
<PARA>The government is indeed encouraged by this strong indication of cross-party support for passage of this important legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that the committee has made the following recommendations for the minister's consideration: firstly, that the minister raise with the Minister for Finance the need to ensure that selection processes from future airport lessees take into account the broader development and economic concerns of the states, territories and local governments. I am confident that the Minister for Transport and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2853"> Regional Development (Mr Sharp) will have no difficulty with this recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second recommendation is that the government establish clear consultative processes with the states, territories and local governments. I note that there could be substantial benefits from adopting a partnership approach to airport matters of mutual concern to the Commonwealth, states, territories and local governments within the broad framework of responsibilities established in the Airports Bill and associated regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third recommendation is that the minister is to regulate to ensure that non-aeronautical business activities are consistent with state, territory and local government planning and trading laws. The bill provides that Commonwealth law will apply, but the government expects that airport operators will seek consistency with state, territory and local government law for such activities. However, the government has noted the submissions made by the states and local government. I am sure the minister will give careful consideration to this recommendation that the minister regulate to ensure appropriate outcomes in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee also drew to the minister's attention a number of concerns raised by the airlines. While some of the concerns raised are not new, the treatment of each matter raised is being given further consideration. In a number of cases, while the outcomes being sought by the airlines could be appropriate, the view taken to date has been that such outcomes can be achieved on a commercial basis by the parties involved without the need for government intervention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Overall, the government's response to the Senate committee's report is positive. As noted earlier, I am looking forward to the Senate committee's support for the passage of these bills being translated into their actual passage by the Senate following the second reading debate on this particular legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I turn to the contributions that have been made by senators. I acknowledge that all senators who have spoken today have a close and personal interest in this particular issue. Senator Bob Collins was the first speaker on behalf of the Australian Labor Party on this <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> issue. Whilst many of his remarks could be commented on as being rather lukewarm and parochial, he did address the issue of how the government will deal with the sale of regional airports. The government has a philosophical commitment to an open tender process for the sale of airports. Anything less will raise the spectre of special deals for special groups. There will be no WA Inc. under this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, we are obviously not unaware of the issues related to local ownership and we favour that as a matter of principle. How this will be put into practice is yet to be determined, but I can say that Alice Springs, Launceston and Hobart airports are the kinds of airport leases for which the government will want to consider how to ensure that the sale processes give life to that particular principle. Like Senator Collins, I would also acknowledge the development of Northern Territory airports by the Federal Airports Corporation but I would point out that the Howard government is a forward&hyphen;looking government, not retrospective and not debt driven like the ALP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Woodley decided to oppose the bills, and we regret that. His contribution in the debate here, by really regurgitating the comments of Senator Kernot, makes him into rather a pussycat of Senator Kernot and rather reflects the policies of 1950s Soviet Union. But Senator Woodley made a couple of points which are wrong and cannot go unanswered. With regard to competition between airports, we are, of course, going to do all we can to encourage competition. But that will in a direct sense only occur at the margin.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the document. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2854"> </PARA>
<PARA>I rise to speak on this report of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia&hyphen;European Union trade and investment towards 2000</EMPHASIS>  for three reasons. Firstly, I would like to congratulate Ian Forsyth and Alex Brooking, the two DFAT officers who were principally responsible for the compilation of this report, and to acknowledge the work of Don Cuddihy and Geoffrey Leach, the major contributors to this report. I have worked with these officers previously and I must say Australia is flattered to have such competent officers as these. This is indeed a piece of valuable work that they have provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, I wish to take issue with the contention made by Minister Downer and Minister Fischer who are the joint authors of the foreword of this report. The contention is that somehow we have given less public attention to the needs of Australia&hyphen;European Union trade over the last decade. I think it is acknowledged by the joint authors that yes, of course&mdash;and rightly&mdash;our interests in Asia have predominated in that period, but I do not think Australia has left Europe on the backburner over that period of time either.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As evidence, I cite the meeting between former Prime Minister Thatcher and former Prime Minister Hawke, setting up a joint relationship between Australia and the United Kingdom on trade, and the meeting between me as former Minister for Trade and the President of the Board of Trade, Mr Michael Heseltine, from the UK side in following on that initiative. Many Australian companies see Britain as a jumping-off point for trade in Europe. There have been two-way trade delegations embracing France, Germany and Italy. Indeed, during the Uruguay Round negotiations a lot of attention was paid to the Australia&hyphen;Europe relationship, albeit with agriculture overshadowing the entire debate as rightly it should.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My third and most important reason for rising today to speak on this report is that yesterday in the House of Representatives we had a budget brought down which undermines the very efficacy of this report and renders many of the recommendations of this report completely obsolete. This report is, of course, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> about how we promote trade and investment between Australia and Europe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The principal agency that the Commonwealth government retains for that work is Austrade. Austrade had its trade promotion budget cut yesterday by $100 million over three years. That is not a vote of confidence in Austrade's ability to capture the many and varied gains possible in Europe for Australian companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, more than that, the export market development grants scheme was cut by $340 million over four years in yesterday's budget. The chances for small and large Australian companies wanting to get into Europe to access export market development grants and use that support for market entry are vastly diminished. That is hardly a vote of confidence in Australian and European trade, or trade between Australia and any other country or bloc in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The international trade enhancement scheme, the ITE scheme, was cut by $120 million over four years&mdash;a total cut in support for Australian industry getting into foreign markets of $560 million over four years. That is not a vote of confidence by this government in market opportunity for Australian industry in Europe or anywhere else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, importantly, this report refers to Australia as an investment destination for European capital, and cites one of the key attractors of that investment as being our research and development regime. That is mentioned at some length on page 18 of this report. Might I say that the changes to R&amp;D, the reduction from 150 per cent to 125 per cent, the ending of syndication, will undermine a lot of the R&amp;D that creates valuable products in this country. Australia will no longer be able to take its place in this trade, which will reduce its attractiveness accordingly. The investment promotion campaign, which has attracted so many regional headquarters, is abolished. European headquarters have come to Australia, in part, because of that campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a valuable report. It makes valuable recommendations and suggestions about how we can improve our trade relationship with Europe, but the budget undermines everything <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2855"> that this report stands for. I think Ministers Downer and Fischer, who have prefaced this report with such encouraging remarks, should take responsibility and try to change those budget settings to give Australian exporters a chance in what is an important market and try to turn back the situation where we stop exporting commodities only, or in the majority, and start exporting more elaborately transformed manufactures. Rather than buy back all of the elaborately transformed manufactures from Europe, we should send some in their direction as well. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>This report, which has just been tabled, deals with various projects, both road and rail, developing around Australia to improve Australia's land transport infrastructure. Most of this infrastructure, particularly in rail, came from the One Nation project, which then Prime Minister Keating announced in early 1992. Road projects also received One Nation money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The present government, when in opposition, and many economic commentators, used to keep saying that Australia could not afford the One Nation program. But I want to point out that the money invested at that time during the recession not only created employment but also significantly improved the land transport infrastructure of Australia. For example, in my home state of South Australia, the connection of Adelaide to the standard gauge railway is something we had been asking for for generations, but it was the Paul Keating One Nation statement that provided the money. Nobody criticises that project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that in Melbourne the western ring&hyphen;road is funded overwhelming by One Nation money, yet I notice that when various sections of it were opened, the Premier of Victoria, Mr Kennett, was quick to claim credit for some of the new phases of that significant infrastructure improvement for Victoria.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I draw the attention of the Senate and the public to this report because it outlines the commitment of the previous governments, the Hawke and the Keating governments, to improve the infrastructure of Australia. In the budget announced last night, we note the removal of funds for the upgrading of the Pacific Highway, which was a commitment we made in government, and the removal of money for the so-called black spots program. When we look at the aggregate cuts to state funding, this new federal budget has reduced money for roads in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reduction in road funding is a step backwards by the coalition government. I suspect that in the months ahead, as this parliament, and the Senate in particular through the estimates committees, has a chance to examine the actual expenditure on roads outlined in this budget, the people of regional and rural Australia will certainly see that they have been sold a pup in the development of roads and rail in Australia, but particularly roads.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This will be a major issue on which the opposition will campaign and expose the deceit of the new government in claiming that they have provided extra money for road development in Australia when, through their own budget process and the reduction of road funding to the states, they have significantly reduced road development in this country, which of course is an economic cost to the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Good infrastructure in roads and rail means that our productive industries can get their goods to port for export and industries can reduce their distribution costs accordingly. Also by improving and building better highways in Australia, we can reduce the awful road toll that Australia has suffered for so many years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend this report because it shows what the previous government had done to improve the land transport infrastructure of Australia. Unfortunately, the new government, in the budget announced last night, has gone a long way to reduce that infrastructure expenditure for some mad reason which is beyond us in the opposition.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak briefly tonight about a matter that has been brought to my attention in Tasmania by the Lenah Valley School Association. That association has concerns about a mobile phone base station which is going to be located some 76 metres from the school boundary. It has forwarded a petition with in excess of 1,000 signatures to the House of Assembly, and tomorrow a petition with some 894 signatures will be presented on my behalf drawing the government's attention to that association's concerns.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of particular concern is the health risk associated with electromagnetic radiation. I might say, pardon the pun, that not enough energy has been put into this research. I am pleased to say that the government has established a committee of officials to examine electromagnetic energy and to advise on the adequacy of health exposure standards, compliance procedures, and national and international research findings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee includes representatives from the Department of Communications and the Arts, the Department of Health and Family Services, the Spectrum Management Agency, Austel, the Australian Radiation Laboratory, the Therapeutic Goods Administration and the CSIRO. This committee must also consult and provide information to the public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> By remaining informed across the broad range of electromagnetic energy public health issues, the government ensures that it actions in this area are based on the best available national and international advice. Nevertheless, as I said earlier, in this particular case and in other cases there is widespread concern about the health impacts of EME, electromagnetic energy. Research from around the world has indicated that there could be problems, especially for children. Even our own CSIRO has published a report stating that research on biological effects and develop ment of safety standards always lags many years behind technological development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I believe that, before Telstra sites mobile phone base stations near our schools, more research needs to be done. The Australian standards need to be proved to be rigid enough to protect our children from exposure to radiofrequency energy. I urge the government to continue to fund this committee so that its important work can be done and that, one day, it could undertake or commission research specific to EME in Australia. I also urge the government to ensure that Telstra is unable to site these towers close to schools in the interim. Other less dangerous areas need to be found.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I have written to the minister voicing the concerns of Loris Watchorn, who is a member of the mobile phone base station committee that was set up by the Lenah Valley School Association, which is so concerned about these problems. I hope that his answer will be forthcoming in the near future.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak tonight on the issue of foreign aid announced in the budget last night. During the 13 years of the previous government and during the nearly 10 years I have been here Senator Hill has made consistent criticism, including when he was the coalition foreign affairs spokesman for many years in this place and in the wider community, about the Labor Party never being able to meet the 0.7 per cent of GDP for foreign aid, which was the United Nations standard for what developed countries should provide in overseas aid, or even being able to meet the Labor Party conference decision of a few years ago of four per cent of GDP by the latter part of this decade.</PARA></TALK.START>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2857">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that the coalition made good hay when the sun shined criticising us on that and going out to the aid groups in the community, which are widespread. There are well over 50 overseas aid organisations operating in Australia, raising their money themselves, getting money from the federal government through the aid budget and spending it efficiently overseas to help those people who are in less fortunate positions than Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year Mr Downer made a commitment to aid agencies that he would abolish the DIFF program because it was not proper overseas aid. Some of the aid agencies responded that this would be a good move. I suspect that they were expecting that if DIFF were abolished the money would be transferred to either bilateral or multilateral aid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What happened on budget night was a disgraceful performance in view of all the words said in opposition by the spokespersons of the coalition. As a result of the cutbacks this year, Australia's overseas aid budget will be only 0.29 per cent of GDP, a drop of I think over 0.3 per cent in one budget. I cannot recollect it ever getting that low at any time we were in office for 13 years. I do not think the overseas target of the Malcolm Fraser coalition government, which was in office for seven years, was ever under 0.3 per cent of GDP. But Mr Howard and Mr Costello, in their first budget, have delivered massive cuts to overseas aid and dropped it below 0.3 per cent for the first time in anyone's memory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a disgraceful performance. It is one that does this country no credit. It adds further to the bumbling incompetence of the foreign minister, who, in the short four to five months as minister, has become an international embarrassment to us. The handling of the cessation of the DIFF scheme alone has done more damage than any number of other episodes in Australia's recent foreign affairs relationships with countries in our region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the hearing of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee which dealt with the cessation of DIFF, representative after representative from the business community&mdash;who by no means could be called radical supporters of the Labor <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Party&mdash;gave awful examples of how our reputation overseas has been damaged by the foreign minister cancelling the DIFF program without any consultation with countries in the region, with whom we are supposed to have excellent relations. It will take a long time for us to recover from that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Overall in this budget there is a 10 per cent reduction&mdash;straight down&mdash;in overseas aid. There has not been an evening out of outlays over the next few years&mdash;just a straight reduction of 10 per cent. Funding for population control as part of our aid money to the United Nations apparently has been abolished. This is an extraordinary cut to our overseas aid. It does no good to the reputation of Australia&mdash;a very large continent that is blessed with having a small population compared with countries to our north and other regions of the world where overpopulation, overcrowding, is the major social and economic issue they face.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are walking away from the modest funding we used to provide for population control programs&mdash;programs that were in no way coercive. They were developmental programs, educational programs, particularly to encourage women in poor circumstances, women who lack education, how they can control their own fertility so that they can make rational choices about the number of children they should bear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been cutbacks to organisations that are associated with the trade union movement. In the mid-1980s the trade union movement in Australia accepted responsibility by establishing an aid program whereby they would provide some money. It was not as much as they would have liked, I suspect, but they made the principal commitment to fund overseas aid programs, particularly in the training area. That has all been abolished&mdash;I think because the coalition has some ideological view that the money involving the trade union is somehow perverted or being misused.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have seen the trade union training programs in such countries as Cambodia and Vietnam. On previous visits to those countries I have seen the beneficiaries&mdash;those who have had the training provided by those programs, such as learning English, trade training and so <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2858"> on. These were excellent programs run by excellent young Australians and were funded in part by the trade union movement and by the overseas aid budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only in the multilateral aid area have substantial funding cuts been made but we also see them in the bilateral arrangements we have had. Countries such as China, Indonesia, the Philippines and India have all had massive reductions in the aid being provided to them. I do not know how Mr Downer, when he next meets with Asian countries, will explain the background to these massive cuts. I do not think those countries will take too kindly to the political expression that we had to fill a black hole in the budget. When they look at the size of our economy, the prosperity of our country, the fact that we have a First World economy with growth and a well trained and educated population and see that we do not suffer the appalling poverty that their countries do, they will consider our excuse that there was a black hole in the budget to be very weak indeed. We all know that with none of these cuts that deficit would have almost disappeared over the next three years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Downer will have an appalling problem trying to explain the background to these cuts. In view of his very awkward performance&mdash;that is the best way I can describe it, although `appalling' is a more apt way to describe it&mdash;in his first five months in the job, no-one could have any confidence that Mr Downer can explain to these countries the reasons for these savage cuts coming on top of the cessation of the DIFF program. Australia's reputation will be besmirched because we will be seen as becoming increasingly selfish and introverted in our relations with these countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With these cuts we are saying that we are not concerned about what happens regarding development in Asia, that they are on their own even though we have the advantage of a decent standard of living and a First World economy&mdash;a stronger economy, an economy that in aggregate is still greater in size than most of the combined economies of South-East Asia. They will find it very difficult to see the justification for these very significant cuts, which run into over hundreds of millions <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of dollars this year, next year and the following year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My final comment is that I think at the last election some overseas aid agencies from Australia fell for the line by Mr Downer that basically there would not be any cuts. He would cut DIFF, but he left open the issue of money from that funding cut being transferred to direct aid. Every one of those overseas aid agencies was duded in the budget last night. It is to the eternal shame of the coalition that they have made these awful cuts to our overseas aid budget. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on a matter of great concern to me and I think a matter of great concern to a large number of people in this chamber. I know that Senator Patterson for many years has had a great deal of concern about the treatment of the elderly and ensuring that they get a fair go in this community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason I have seen fit to speak on this issue tonight is that I very much see that this budget is not in accord with the general principle that our elderly, the older people in our community, not only are entitled to a particular regard but also should be looked after, particularly those people who, through maybe a difficult life or poor planning or some unanticipated event, find themselves in a situation where financially or personally they are unable to care for themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To some extent I was excited in my view or it became more obvious to me in the debate today in question time and from some of the statements made during question time. In relation to a very straightforward and I thought honest question from Senator Woodley, I was very concerned that the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Family Services in the Senate, Senator Newman, seemed to be unable to give us some fairly essential information that is obviously of some great interest not only to the members of this chamber and those in the other place but also to a vast majority of elderly people and the families that care very much for them.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2859">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure everyone is aware that HACC services are the provision of care within people's homes. HACC provides for the frail, the elderly and what might be described as the young disabled. It has been a program that has had its ups and downs. Despite all of that, it has provided a great deal of benefit to the individuals who have been assisted and who have been able in some circumstances to remain independent and to enjoy the lifestyle of an independent resident, but at the same time have the support necessary from the community services to allow them to remain at home where otherwise they might not be able to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This care can cover a range of things&mdash;from personal hygiene to maybe help with medication or the organisation of lifestyle to deal with a particular medical problem. It also has, by a happy coincidence, a financial benefit for the community at large in that it is obviously much more efficient to have someone at home still maintaining an independent lifestyle than to have them slotted into a hostel or a nursing home and having to rely entirely on the public purse. So, all round, it is a program that people derive a great deal of benefit from and something that I have been a big supporter of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having a brief look through Budget Paper No. 1, page 3&hyphen;109, what distresses me in relation to HACC is a fairly brief line item, as they all are, which says, `Increase user charging in the Home and Community Care Programme.' If you have a look at that, you see that in this first year it is a saving of $4 million, next year it is a saving of $12.7 million and in the third year it is a saving of $19.6 million. When you look at the bare figures like that, it does not seem to mean a lot. But when you translate that into a number of people who for many years have relied on HACC to help support them you see that there are going to be a lot of elderly people in particular out there who will not be provided with the support that I think they are entitled to. That is a very sad part of the budget.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope very much that Senator Patterson will be expressing her views very strongly within her own party, because I hope she would not be supporting such a  proposal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the deceit of elderly people, that is not where the bad news ends. Nursing homes have taken a bit of a beating, as it were, as well. There are a couple of fees that are pretty up&hyphen;front that have been introduced in the budget. One is the nursing home entry fees. Any reference to the nursing home entry fees is pretty scarce. I have spoken to a number of people in the industry and they are unclear about how that exactly is going to operate. In fact, even though they have sought further detail from the Minister for Health and Family Services, Michael Wooldridge, they have been unable to get the information they need to make an assessment about how it will operate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Essentially what has been said is that, on a means tested basis, people will be charged entry when they go into a nursing home. If you extrapolate the average cost of an entry fee into hostels, you find that it is $26,000. Obviously the average figure paid as an entry fee into hostels does not necessarily translate into what is payable on entry to a nursing home. But, being the most comparable situation, it is probably reasonable to assume that $26,000, which is the average amount payable in hostels, is not so far from what might on average be payable in nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The greatest concern is that $26,000 is the average fee that might be payable. In fact, the scope of the policies allows for as high as $88,000 to be payable. That is the limit. That is the greatest amount that anyone can pay. But a lot of people out there&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;How many nursing homes charge the limit now?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="B36">Senator NEAL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A lot of elderly people and a lot of people who care about them and look after them, their families, might think that $88,000 is a bit steep. Certainly I share that view. The sad thing about it is that not only is this entry fee now going to be charged, but also at the same time the loan moneys that are provided for capital works in nursing homes has been abolished. So the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2860"> contribution that the federal government has made to date towards providing funds for capital construction in nursing homes is at the same time being taken away. Again that is a very sad thing for the elderly in our community and I am sure the people in the coalition who care about the elderly will have something to say about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> That means that, because the entry fee is also means tested, those nursing homes that take on a lot of people in lower income groups and are not able to claim the entry fee will also be missing what has been traditionally provided through loans, which is a source of funds for capital works. That will skew the whole system so that nursing homes will be encouraged to take on people who are capable of paying high entry fees in order to continue with their capital works. Again it means that the elderly in our community who are not well off, who through some accident of their life or circumstances cannot look after themselves financially, will find it more difficult to find a place as they become more physically frail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not the end of the bad news in this budget for the elderly. Nursing home fees will be $34 per day, $12,000 a year&mdash;another initiative of this budget that does not care about the elderly. That fee is payable for anyone who goes beyond the pension-free area, which I understand is pension plus approximately $30, but I have to say that from the material that has been provided by the minister, it is not exactly clear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> How have the elderly been treated in terms of health? Not very well either. Again, the less well off are those who suffer the most. The dental health care program was introduced by the federal government to top up state funding. We had an appalling situation where people were waiting 24 months, two years, to get dental treatment; that is pensioners, those people that we should be look looking after and people on health cards. If you have difficulty with your teeth, it is not much help if you are waiting 24 months. The solution in those circumstances was that teeth were not being saved. It took too much time, was too complicated if people had difficulty with their teeth. You could not perform <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> complicated procedures that were going to save those teeth; you pulled them out. Teeth were extracted.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam President, this is the first time since your elevation to your position that I have had the opportunity to speak to the chamber. May I congratulate the Senate on having you as President. In a certain sense, you have a classic background of having been in the law and then coming into politics. You have been, may I say, a most distinguished lawyer and a most distinguished parliamentarian. I have no doubt that you will be among the great presidents, Madam President. People sometimes criticise lawyers, but I always think there are never quite enough lawyers in parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I want to speak tonight on a couple of topics. The first is on a matter that you yourself raised this morning; that is, the going from this place of Mr Alan Platt, who has been in charge of this chamber for over a decade now. He represents, I think, all the best that there is about this place, about the people who make the place run, who make the functioning of the Senate and of the House of Representatives and of the place generally of the high standard that it is. I think it is proper that we recognise him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I am glad to see in the information bulletin that is published by the Department of the Senate a recording of the fact that Mr Alan Platt received the meritorious service medallion and certificate for his outstanding performance as the Senate chamber supervisor. That is grand to see. It is a pity that this Senate is about to lose his services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Alan represents the sort of people who look after us day after day in this place and, in paying tribute to Alan, I would like to pay tribute to them. There are interesting things about him. For example, I am told that he played hockey with Alan Cumming Thom, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2861"> who was a former Clerk of this place, and with John Stone, who was a former eminent senator here, amongst other things. He was, of course, a person who fulfilled many roles. On behalf of Senator McKiernan who, if he was sitting in his right place, would be sitting next to me, and all senators, I would like to thank Alan Platt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> While I am going through the information bulletin, I also mention the legal and constitutional committee secretariat who also received an achievement award for their consistent performance of duty to a high standard throughout the 37th parliament, setting a good example for their colleagues. I see Senator McKiernan and Senator O'Chee here. I think they would be delighted that the secretariat of that very distinguished committee received that award.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also mention three people from the Nurses Centre: Sue Game, Jocelyn Murphy and Margaret Heydon. They gave great service to about 40 people on the unhappy day, as it turned out to be, last Monday when the awful events took place at the front of Parliament House. They treated police, they treated people who entered through the doors, they treated anybody who needed to be treated and they did so with great distinction. It just shows how valuable a service they perform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had treatment myself from them over the years. In the last session I had all sorts of trouble with my leg, and they gave me the sort of comfort and advice that has led to its recovery.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also apologise for having been unruly earlier, but I could not cope with sitting here hearing what Senator Neal had to say, especially in broadcast time, when the Labor Party is running around scaring older Australians. I found it outrageous. She continued tonight to spread the furphy that those opposite have spread since the budget was released last night about entry contributions to nursing homes and the level they will be at. I found it appalling, and I hope that anybody who was listening to her will not believe the furphy.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2862">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I go on with that, I want to join with Senator Cooney in expressing&mdash;on behalf of other senators, I guess, who are not here and I am sure would say it for me&mdash;my appreciation to Alan Platt and in farewelling him. He plies us with water and, as many times as I have asked him for gin in the water, I have not had it. Sometimes I have felt like I needed a gin in the water and I am sure he felt like he needed a gin sometimes when we sat till two and three in the morning. I think that sometimes we forget, when we can wander in and out and go and see a video or go up to our rooms, that those who are here in the chamber are here for very long periods of time, serve us very well, never get cross and seem to have even tempers from early in the morning till early the next morning. I say farewell to Alan and wish him a very happy, prosperous and enjoyable retirement. I am sure he will find something to do and be active in the community. My sincere thanks to you, Alan, for all that you have done for me in the nine years I have been in this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Alan is most probably very interested in the government policies for older Australians, as I am, because I am part of the baby boom. If we do not get it right, it will be a disaster for the next generation: we will leave a bill which will not be able to be paid. The previous government left nursing homes and hostels in a disgraceful state&mdash;nursing homes in particular.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Professor Gregory, their own appointment to carry out an inquiry into nursing home funding, found that there was something in the order of over $300 million needed to bring current nursing homes up to standard. This former Labor Party government did nothing about that. It sat on its hands for at least the nine years that I have been in this parliament and did naught.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have been left with a situation where we have to address that issue. As I have moved around, I have most probably visited more nursing homes than any other person in this parliament, and I do not often make such a claim. Nursing home after nursing home after nursing home will tell you that it is iniquitous that you charge an ingoing or an <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> up&hyphen;front payment, which is rebatable under certain rules&mdash;a certain amount comes back to the individual or to their estate&mdash;when you go into a hostel, depending on your means, and you do not when you go into a nursing home. Many institutions would tell me that they could not see the logic in it and that that was one way that we could address it: that people would share that cost and that people going into nursing homes would be assessed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Neal perpetuated the furphy that has been going around in the last 24 hours&mdash;she did not actually say it but she almost implied it, and I listened carefully&mdash;that people will be charged $26,000. They will not be charged on average $26,000. I think&mdash;and stand to be corrected; Senator Knowles will correct me if I am not right&mdash;that 30 per cent of people make no ingoing payment to hostels now. And it will not change for nursing homes. If a person does not have the money, they will not be charged an ingoing payment and they will pay 87.5 per cent of the pension. There will be very strict rules about the number of people who are financially disadvantaged, which each nursing home and hostel will be required to take.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we have to find funds from somewhere and if the current generation of older, able people does not contribute, we will leave a debt problem for the next generation when the baby boomers come on stream for nursing home care. We might all think it will not happen to us, but it will be my age group in 20 years time who will need to have that in place. We need to get it right now, and that is what we are doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Neal also spoke about HACC. I do not know how she reads the budget papers but, for the benefit of those people listening tonight, the facts are that HACC funding will rise by approximately six per cent&mdash;I think, $28 million. Senator Neal claimed that Senator Newman did not answer the question. If she had listened carefully she would have heard Senator Newman say that she thought that Senator Woodley had asked a question about aged care but in fact had asked about HACC. When she realised that, she then answered that there will be a six per cent increase. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2863">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tomorrow I will look at what Senator Neal said to make sure she did not actually mislead the Senate. When I have done that, I will come back into the chamber. I want to put on the record that there will be a six per cent increase in home and community care funding for older people and for people with disabilities et cetera, who require some care to maintain themselves at home&mdash;maybe Meals on Wheels or having a bar put in beside the shower so they can get in and out of the bath and those sorts of facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In her answer to a question, Senator Newman pointed out that HACC has grown like Topsy and there is some inequity in the way different states treat the delivery of HACC. I think all senators in this chamber would agree that it should not depend on whether you live in Queensland, Tasmania or Victoria as to whether you get an equal share of the HACC funding, and that you should be treated in the same way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister Moylan is therefore ensuring that the policy will be fair and that HACC clients will be treated consistently across Australia. I should have thought that that was something the Australian Labor Party would have welcomed, but they did nothing when HACC was in a mess with people falling between stools. The minister is increasing funding and trying to address some of the inequities in the HACC system. But Senator Neal disregards that and goes on as if it is all doom and gloom.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Neal did not tell those people who are listening that the pension has now been indexed at 25 per cent of male average weekly earnings. That indexation is now built into forward estimates, which has never happened before. But the government has made that commitment so that older Australians do not have to worry about their pension being indexed. She did not add that the older Australians who are self&hyphen;funded retirees, many of whom are on fixed superannuation and who have been living in genteel poverty under Labor, are the sorts of people that Labor claimed they looked after; but they are the sorts of people who deserted them in the election because Labor lost sight of them.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over and over again many of those older people have come to me and said, `It seems unfair to us that we are treated differently from pensioners on the same income with regard to tax&hyphen;free thresholds.' That has been addressed: those people on the same income as pensioners will have a tax break in that their tax&hyphen;free threshold will rise. We did not hear about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another issue which has concerned people in the aged care industry is respite care. We did not hear Senator Neal say that there will be an increase in funding for respite care. Nor did we hear her say that never, in the 13 years of Labor, was there an acknowledgment of an increased cost in caring for people with dementia in nursing homes and hostels. That will be factored into a new funding regime which will take into account the fact that people with dementia need more care than ambulant, frail, older people. An enormous leap forward for the aged care sector. Senator Neal omitted to tell the good news about the budget.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Veterans' Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Veterans' Affairs acknowledges the findings of the Institute of Medicine at the National Academy of Sciences in the United States. In response to these findings the Minister for Veterans' Affairs set up an Expert Committee in April this year to examine the findings and establish their relevance to Australian Vietnam veterans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">2) There are differences between the legislative requirements governing the provision of veterans benefits in USA and Australia. The essential difference is that the Australian system requires a causal connection between eligible service and disability, while the American system only requires a statistical association. As the American study did not address the question of causation, this issue required examination before an Australian response could be properly considered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Expert Committee was set up with the following Terms of Reference:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) to consider the scientific merit of the Academy's report;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) to assess whether any findings in their report are applicable to women who served in Vietnam or may have been exposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Committee was given 90 days to report. The time was necessary to relate the Terms of Reference of the Expert Committee to the American data and the Australian experience in Vietnam, and to call for submissions from ex&hyphen;service organisations and interested parties including affected Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The Government will consider the findings of the report when it has been provided by the Australian Expert Committee. No announcement will be made until that consideration is complete.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes. The following list of the 20 largest capital equipment projects is based on the `Unapproved New Major Equipment Program' document (referred to as the Pink Book), as approved by the Force Structure Policy &amp; Programming Committee. This is an internal Defence document which is reviewed regularly. The next review is scheduled in September 1996. Although the Pink Book is a classified document, as it contains sensitive details of project costs and capabilities, an unclassified version is released periodically.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The projects are grouped according to cost bands to preserve confidentiality and to protect the Commonwealth's position in contract negotiations with prospective tenderers. As these projects are unapproved they will continue to be reviewed and their scope and cost may change substantially before they are submitted for Government approval. The Pink Book is, in fact, only a basis for internal long&hyphen;term planning and is substantially over&hyphen; <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> programmed to allow management flexibility. Further, the capabilities for many projects are indicative only, as they have not yet been subjected to the detailed review which occurs prior to their approval by Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The following list is based on the current version of the `Unapproved New Major Equipment Program', (Pink Book 2/1995&mdash;2000), which was approved by the committee in February 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Projects with estimated total cost greater than $1 billion</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. Airborne Early Warning and Control System</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This project would involve the acquisition of Airborne Early Warning and Control Aircraft. It is currently planned that an initial design stage of the project would commence by about 1997 and that the last aircraft would enter operational service by about 2003. If agreed, the acquisition of these aircraft would enhance Australia's air defence by providing microwave radar coverage for effective detection, identification and tracking of air targets, and close control of interceptors/fighters, complementing the Jindalee Operational Radar Network, which will have an effective broad area surveillance capability but not the same quality of tracking and control information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. Offshore Patrol Combatant Acquisition</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This project would involve the acquisition of Offshore Patrol Combatants (OPCs) to replace the current fleet of Fremantle Class Patrol Boats. It is currently planned that the acquisition process would commence in about 1997 and that it would conclude with the commissioning of the last vessel in about 2006. If agreed, acquisition of OPCs would provide coastal surveillance, patrol and response within Australian waters. Being larger than the Fremantles that they would replace, OPCs would have better seakeeping thereby making them a more effective patrol vessel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. Rotary Wing Surveillance, Reconnaissance, Fire Support and Troop Lift</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This project would involve the acquisition of helicopters for surveillance, reconnaissance, troop movement and fire support for the Army. The capability would consist of either a common platform or a mix of utility and armed reconnaissance helicopters. It is currently planned that preliminary definition studies would commence in about 1997 and that the final aircraft would enter operational service in about 2006. If agreed, the acquisition of this capability would provide enhanced mobility for ground troops, aerial reconnaissance, and highly flexible fire support and engagement of targets in widely dispersed and remote locations, thereby enhancing our ability to interdict hostile forces on Australian territory. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2868"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Projects with estimated total cost between $500 million and $1 billion</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">4. Australian Defence Force (ADF) Air Refuelling Capability</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This project would involve the enhancement of the ADF's air refuelling capability. It is currently planned that introduction of this capability into service would commence in about 2000 and that it would be concluded by about 2002. If agreed, the proposed enhancement would supplement the limited air refuelling capability currently provided by four modified B707 tanker aircraft and, by extending the coverage and range of Australian Defence Force air assets, would enable them to be more flexibly employed during operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">5. ADF Ground Based Air Defence Weapon System</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This project would involve the acquisition of a ground based Air Defence Weapon System to replace the aging Rapier system. It is currently planned that procurement would commence in about 2000 and that the project would be completed by about 2004. If agreed, such a system would contribute to air defence and reduce the vulnerability of civilian and military assets in northern Australia to air attacks that could be potentially launched against Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">6. F/A&hyphen;18 Hornet Upgrade</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This project would involve a range of upgrades to the key systems of the Hornet aircraft (including software and hardware) in order to increase its operational effectiveness. It is currently planned that the first major upgrade would commence in about 1997 and that the last upgraded aircraft would return to operational service by about 2003. F/A&hyphen;18 aircraft play a key role in maintaining the ADF's capability to intercept and defeat hostile aircraft and missiles. If agreed, the proposed upgrades would maintain the aircraft's operational effectiveness as aircraft and weapon developments continue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">7. FFG Progressive Upgrade</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This project would involve the maintenance of the capability of the FFG fleet through to their planned end of life. The current combat system of the FFG is now some 20 years old. If agreed, the upgrade would provide the FFG with better defensive systems, particularly against anti&hyphen;ship missiles. It is currently planned that implementation of the upgrade program would commence in about 1998, and that the last upgraded vessel would return to operational service by about 2003.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">8. High Frequency Radio Communications Modernisation</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This project would involve the acquisition of an integrated, joint ADF tactical High Frequency (HF) radio communications network. It is currently <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> planned that preliminary study would commence in 1997 and that the mature system would be operational by 2002. If agreed, this project would improve the reliability, security and capacity of HF radio as the primary survivable means of tactical communication within Australia and the immediate region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">9. Light Tactical Airlift Capability</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This project would involve the acquisition of a light transport aircraft to maintain the capability currently provided by the Caribou. The light tactical airlift capability differs from the C130 Hercules airlift capability in that it provides a light lift/short take&hyphen;off and landing air transport capability and increased flexibility to a range of supported forces. It is currently planned that development of the project would commence in about 1997 and that the final replacement aircraft would enter operational service by about 2000. If agreed, this project would provide the capability to support operations in northern Australia in a cost&hyphen;effective manner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">10. Tactical Airlift Capability</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This project would involve the maintenance of the ADF's tactical air transport capability, currently provided by the C130H fleet, either through the acquisition of replacement aircraft or the refurbishment of the C130H aircraft. It is currently planned that the initial phase of procurement would commence in about 1998 and that the final aircraft would enter operational service by about 2000. If agreed, this project would provide continued air mobility to the ADF for response and sustainment tasks.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Projects with estimated total cost between $200 million and $500 million</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">11. Anzac Frigate Warfighting Improvement Program</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This project would involve the upgrade of the capabilities of Australia's eight Anzac frigates. It is currently planned that the upgrade would commence in about 1998 and that the last upgraded ship would return to operational service by about 2005. Anzac ships, together with FFGs (which are also being upgraded), comprise the ADF surface combatant force capability beyond the year 2000. If agreed, the upgrade of the Anzac capability would improve the ability of the ships to defend themselves against air attack, particularly from anti&hyphen;ship missiles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">12. AUSTACSS&mdash;Australian Army Tactical Command Support System</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This project would involve the development of a fully automated tactical command support system to facilitate the flow and processing of command information within, and between, headquarters of the land forces. It is currently planned that the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2869"> development of the mature system would commence in about 1998 and that the system would be in place by about 2000. If agreed, the proposal would replace the current manual development of reports and assimilation of battlefield data (from personnel reports and mechanical sensors), ensuring that efficiencies in command and command support structures could be realised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">13. Bushranger&mdash;Infantry Mobility Vehicle</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This project would involve the acquisition of suitable vehicles, complete with ancillary equipment, to provide integral mobility for the rifle companies of selected infantry battalions of the land force. It is currently planned that the acquisition of the vehicles would commence in about 1999 and that it would be complete by about 2003. If agreed, acquisition of these vehicles would greatly enhance the coverage and effectiveness of infantry battalions in the difficult terrain of northern Australia by providing increased cross&hyphen;country mobility with some protection against light arms fire.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">14. Electronic Warfare for Transport Aircraft</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This project would involve the provision of an Electronic Warfare (EW) self protection capability for ADF transport aircraft, including C&hyphen;130Js. It is currently planned that installation would commence in about 1998 and that the last upgraded aircraft would return to operational service by about 2002. Transport aircraft provide a fundamental combat support capability for the ADF. If agreed, the proposed capability would offer enhanced mechanisms for self protection against missiles and radar&hyphen;directed gunfire, as well as contributing to increased awareness by flight crews of the threat environment in which they were operating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">15. Heavyweight Torpedo</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This project would involve the acquisition of an anti&hyphen;submarine and anti&hyphen;surface ship weapon capability for the Collins Class submarine to replace the existing Mk 48 torpedo when it reaches its planned withdrawal date in the year 2000. It is currently planned that the acquisition and installation of the new torpedos would commence in about 1999 and that it would be completed by about 2004. The current Mk 48 torpedo is becoming difficult to support and maintain as the main user of the weapon, the US Navy, is moving to another more capable torpedo. If agreed, the new torpedo would provide an improved anti&hyphen;submarine and anti&hyphen;surface ship capability, particularly in shallow waters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">16. Offshore Patrol Combatant Helicopter Capability</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This project would involve the acquisition of an intermediate sized helicopter for the Offshore Patrol Vessel (OPC) to undertake maritime surveillance and patrol.

It is currently planned that acquisition would commence in about 2000, and that it would be complete by about 2003. If agreed, the helicopters would provide a significant increase in the surveillance capability of the patrol vessels and they could also be equipped with an air&hyphen;to&hyphen;surface missile.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">17. M113 Minimum Upgrade</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This project would involve the modification of several hundred armoured vehicles in Regular and Reserve armoured units by upgrading their engines and transmissions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) I am aware of a debate in the United States (US) Senate on 4 August 1995 concerning an amount of US$50 million authorised for preparation for hydronuclear testing in the 1995&hyphen;96 fiscal year Defense Authorisation Bill. In the event, however, these funds were not called on by the US Administration following its declaration of support on 11 August 1995 for a zero&hyphen;threshold Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). The US has explicitly stated that its support for a "true zero&hyphen;yield" CTBT precludes the conducting of hydronuclear tests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, it is worth clarifying, for the purpose of answering the honourable senator's questions, that the types of activities which the United States has foreshadowed for its Nevada test site are known as hydrodynamic or subcritical experiments. Unlike hydronuclear tests, such experiments do not produce a nuclear explosive yield and are consistent with a zero&hyphen;yield CTBT.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) (a) Australia, as a non&hyphen;nuclear weapon state, does not have access to the details of nuclear weapons stockpile stewardship techniques.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Hydronuclear, hydrodynamic, subcritical and `virtual' (I take this to be a reference to computer <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> simulation) procedures could each contribute to ensuring the safety and reliability of nuclear weapons as well as to making minor modifications to existing weapon systems. It is my understanding, however, that none of these would enable the development of new generations of nuclear weapon systems. Hydronuclear tests will be banned under a CTBT.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Because hydronuclear tests produce some (usually very small) nuclear explosive yield, any party to a CTBT would be in violation if they conducted such a test. The other types of procedures referred to above would be consistent with a true zero&hyphen;yield CTBT.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) No. The Australian Government recognises that, in conducting subcritical experiments, the US is not acting inconsistently with its commitment&mdash;which we have welcomed&mdash;to the earliest conclusion of a true zero&hyphen;yield CTBT. The Government will continue to work with the US and others on a practical and realistic approach to nuclear disarmament.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Yes. The Australian Government responded immediately to the Chinese test on 8 June and the subsequent test on 29 July. The Prime Minister and I have issued statements conveying the strong opposition of the Australian Government and people to nuclear testing. The Chinese Ambassador in Canberra was called in on both occasions. Australia's Ambassador to China conveyed our protest at senior levels in Beijing. Representations were also made to register our concerns in other capitals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) (a) After the most recent test on 29 July, the Chinese Government announced that it would observe a moratorium on nuclear testing from 30 July 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) The Australian Government has welcomed the Chinese announcement that it will observe a moratorium on nuclear testing. For the first time ever, this will mean that all five nuclear weapon states will be observing testing moratoria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) The Australian Government has expressed concerns in the past that Chinese and other nuclear tests may complicate negotiations for the successful conclusion of a CTBT. China has now imposed a moratorium on nuclear testing from 30 July, before the conclusion of the CTBT negotiations. It has also agreed to a zero&hyphen;threshold CTBT, in accordance with Australian&hyphen;proposed language, which would ban `any nuclear weapon test explosion or any other nuclear explosion'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) China's long&hyphen;standing position that the CTBT should unconditionally allow so&hyphen;called peaceful nuclear explosions (PNEs) was vigorously opposed by Australia and the rest of the international community. China has significantly moderated its position on PNEs, as reflected in the Chair's text currently before the Conference on Disarmament (CD). Any proposal to allow PNEs under the Treaty in the future would require a consensus of states party to the CTBT, which we firmly believe would be unachievable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) The Australian Government, and the rest of the international community, has long opposed provision for PNEs in the CTBT. The reference to PNEs in the draft treaty currently before the CD represents, in the view of  the Chair of the negotiations, the best way to deal with this issue in the context of a final treaty package.
