<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Australian National Maritime Museum Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1996 No. 93.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There does not appear to have been an amendment made to r.4(2) of the principal National Gallery Regulations since 1984, yet the legislation affecting those who would normally be given exemptions from entry charges has undergone substantial change since then. These include the new Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986, the new Social Security Act 1991 and amendments of the Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973 now covered by the present new exemption. Until the present amendments the principal Regulations referred to long repealed provisions of the Social Security Act 1947 and the Repatriation Act 1920.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee would appreciate your advice on why it has taken so long to update the Regulations. For instance, amendment of the principal Australian National Maritime Museum Regulations in 1991 by Statutory Rules 1991 No. 348 would have been a precedent for updating. That amendment refers to both the Social Security Act 1991 and the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Regulations confer a benefit. The Committee would appreciate your advice, however, on whether any person could have been deprived of a benefit by the apparent failure to update. Were the previously existing provisions of the Regulations ignored <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in practice? Were people exempted from paying the charge in breach of the Regulations?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Explanatory Statement for Statutory Rules 1996 No. 93 does not advise of the reasons for the omission of references to Part 2.9 and Part 2.10 from r.2A(2)(b)(i) of the principal Regulations, or an indication of how long ago this updating should have occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New r.4(2)(c)(iii) of Statutory Rules 1996 No. 92 does not italicise the Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973, in contrast to Commonwealth drafting practice as expressed, for instance, in r.2A(2)(b)(iii) of Statutory Rules 1996 No. 93.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter of 2 August 1996 concerning the amendments to the National Gallery Regulations, Statutory Rules 1996 No. 92 and the Australian National Maritime Museum Regulations, Statutory Rules 1996 No. 93.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Committee points out the National Gallery Regulations have not been amended since 1984. This was an oversight exacerbated by the changes in Administrative Arrangement Orders for the Arts side of the portfolio during that time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has expressed concern that people might have been deprived  of a benefit by failure to update the National Gallery Regulations. Subregulation 4(7) of the National Gallery Regulations and subregulation 2A(5) of the Australian National Museum Regulations confer a discretionary power to admit people without payment of entry fees. The National Gallery of Australia and the Australian National Maritime Museum have advised that it is their practice to admit, without payment, people receiving pensions, benefits or allowances. Thus I understand that no one is likely to have been disadvantaged by the failure to update the National Gallery Regulations or the technical drafting defects in the Australian National Maritime Museum Regulations. Nor has it been necessary for these bodies to breach the Regulations in order to allow free entry by persons in receipt of relevant pensions, benefits or allowances. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5250"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In amending the Australian National Maritime Museum Regulations, the Office of Legislative Drafting (OLD) took the opportunity to delete what appeared to be obsolete references to Parts 2.9 and 2.10 of the Social Security Act 1991 (Social Security Act). However, OLD has now advised the reference to Part 2.9 was omitted in error. OLD has also advised that the non&hyphen;italicisation of the Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973 in Statutory Rules No. 92 was a drafting oversight.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I understand that the above technical defects in the Australian National Maritime Museum Regulations will be corrected the next time that the Regulations are amended. I also understand that the Department of Communications and the Arts will be exploring with OLD whether relevant exemptions in both sets of Regulations can be drafted in a more general way to avoid the need to update them on each occasion there is an amendment to relevant Commonwealth legislation.</PARA>

<STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to oppose the reference of the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996 to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am of the view that this is a wrong reference. I am not talking about the substance of the bill or the merits of the issue that the bill refers to. As the Chair of the Legal and Constitutional References Committee and Deputy Chair of the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, I am concerned at the workload of the committee. The taking on of this reference will result, in my opinion, in an exponential increase in the workload of the committee that we will not be able to carry through. We will not be able properly to do the job on the references that are in front of the committee now, or indeed reference itself, with its very tight reporting date, bearing in mind that the holiday season will intervene during the currency of the inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The secretariat of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Standing Committee last year received an award of acknowledgment from the Department of the Senate for the heavy workload that they undertook during the previous 12 months and during the life of the previous parliament. I commend all the members of the secretariat for the enormous amount of work that they did: 15&hyphen; to 18&hyphen;hour days were not unknown to them. I made a vow that when I became chair of the committee, I would not repeat the situation that developed last year. But, unfortunately, if the Senate determines that this reference goes ahead now in this way, that workload would have to be repeated in order to accommodate the workload that we would have on our plate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the edification of honourable senators let me explain just what we are doing. In the legislation committee, we have a reference on the optimal role and function of the Administrative Review Council. We have a reference on the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill 1996. We have a reference on the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.3) 1996. That is just for the legislation committee. If we add the euthanasia bill to that, we would probably get to it in January.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the references committee, we are concluding a reference on the rights and obligations of the media. We have two separate references on the payment of a minister's legal costs. We have another reference on the need to protect Australian citizens against discrimination on vilification on the grounds of their sexuality and transgender identity. We are concluding that reference and we will be going through a chairman's draft very shortly. Submissions for the inquiry into the Australian legal aid system conclude in a matter of weeks and we will shortly be starting a program on that reference with some dates already allocated in January for public hearings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very firmly of the view that the Legal and Constitutional Committee is not the committee that this bill ought to be referred to. I think in the first instance that perhaps a committee dealing with matters of health and palliative care ought to be the committee that would look at it. There are legal and constitutional matters connected and concerned with the bill and which the bill impacts upon. So for that reason it might be worthwhile for the Senate to give consideration to the formation of a select committee to look at all the matters that the bill deals with or impinges upon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure that the Senate could ensure that all interested members and all interests in the bill could be accommodated in the formulation and composition of the committee. I am not so sure that that can be accommodated by referring it to a standing committee or to the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. There are, as the Senate would know, six members of the committee, three who come from the government, two from the opposition and one nomination from the Democrats. There is provision for participating members, so every member of the Senate could&mdash;if they wanted to&mdash;participate in the hearings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But at the conclusion of it all, if the committee was of a view to put forward recommendations, how would you handle it? I cannot see, when all the major parties have determined this matter by conscience vote, how the committee at the conclusion of the inquiry could make recommendations on a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5253"> conscience vote. I think what we need is some time out during the course of the day to discuss this matter on an informal basis. I have found in my experience in this place that most of the better decisions have been made on this informal basis. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(9.46 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not going to speak on this matter but as Senator McKiernan has mentioned the role of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee I feel compelled to put to the Senate some aspects of the matter. In relation to the workload of the committee it is true that the committee has two bills before it but hearing dates are in place for those two bills and the reporting dates are set at 2 and 3 December this year. I see no reason why those targets cannot be met. The reference to the Administrative Review Council is not urgent&mdash;the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) has said that&mdash;and it could be given a lower priority. So that takes care of those three matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to references, the sexuality reference is at the stage where a chairman's draft is under consideration and, over the break, committee members no doubt will have an opportunity to look at the draft. No more hearings are listed so that reference is in hand. It does not, I submit, pose a great problem to the committee. Of the other two references that Senator McKiernan mentioned, one relating to the media and the other to payment of a minister's costs, the payment of a minister's costs has had one previous report in relation thereto and the remainder of that reference is of no great moment as far as work is concerned. In relation to the media there have been prior hearings held and a report delivered. Again, I put it to the Senate that that reference does not attract any great degree of urgency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would agree that the legal aid reference is an important reference. Two hearing dates have been set in January for that and the reporting date, I believe, is not until April next year so there is adequate time for the committee to address that. So I believe the references are all in hand. I do agree with Senator McKiernan that the committee has a heavy workload&mdash;it always has had. I recall <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that in 1993 the committee had just over a week to report on the Native Title Bill and it covered five hearing days in that time&mdash;and did a very good job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, the logistics are sufficiently in hand to address this matter. The Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee is a standing committee which allows participating members to participate in these sorts of references. I think that is an excellent process. It would allow any senators interested in partaking in the inquiry to do so. This committee is a standing committee which is set to look at legal and constitutional issues. If you look at the selection of bills report you will see that the reference touches on legal matters, the Northern Territory legislation, the Commonwealth legislation and the constitutional aspects of that. I submit it is the appropriate committee for this reference.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with Senator Ellison. Like Senator Ellison, I did not intend to speak in this debate but because it is being debated I will speak and foreshadow that I wish to move an amendment to the motion on the report. I agree with Senator Ellison that the Legal and Constitutional Committee is the appropriate committee. I make it clear that I am not opposed to the reference of the bill to the committee. The thing that concerns me&mdash;and I think that honourable senators on reflection will agree with this&mdash;is that this bill, which is a tad more controversial than most bills, has not been given sufficient consideration in terms of this reference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think there should be a more appropriate discussion between all parties in the Senate who have an interest&mdash;Senator Harradine, the Greens, the Democrats and everyone else&mdash;in this bill which will be subject to a very rare procedure in this parliament; a free vote, a conscience vote by everyone. I think a far more appropriate way of dealing with the matter would be to defer just for a short time consideration of what should be done with the selection of this bill. I am not suggesting that the whole report be deferred with the other bills, just this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Ellison rightly said that there are many aspects of this bill. It is not simply a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5254"> question of euthanasia. For me, as a Territorian and as a Territorian who was privileged to spend 10 years as a member in the Northern Territory parliament before I came down here, I have to express my anger&mdash;and I do hope that honourable senators will understand this, because of that background&mdash;with the arrogance of some of our southern colleagues.

Yesterday reference was made in here to the parliament in which I served.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Therefore, the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly only exists by virtue of the federal parliament's goodwill. What the parliament gives, it can also take away.</PARA>
<PARA>Adding that to the appalling statement by Mr Andrews when he led the debate introducing this bill we are now discussing into the House of Representatives when he said, `Territories have no rights, only obligations', I agree with Senator Ellison that this bill does have aspects that go beyond the all&hyphen;important question of euthanasia.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6E4">Senator TAMBLING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, this is one of the most important and fundamental questions to be dealt with by this parliament this year. I appreciate that the government has an important program to be dealt with by the parliament this year consistent with all of the issues the government announced both following the election and arising from the budget process. Nevertheless, all parties and members of this Senate accept that the essential issue of dealing with euthanasia is, properly, a conscience matter for full and appropriate debate and consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am aware that in recent weeks the House of Representatives has agonised over the euthanasia bill. But, to a large degree, the debate has been rushed in the House of Representatives. Following an initial short debate in the other chamber, the bill is now being dealt with by the Main Committee. The Senate is now being asked how it would like to process additional and further consideration of this important, non&hyphen;party political and major social legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Bob Collins very rightly acknowledged, this issue has major import not only for the Northern Territory which both he and I represent but also for the Australian Capital Territory and Norfolk Island. I share Senator Collins's apprehension about the views of other members of parliament who have sought to denigrate the rights of Australian citizens who live in those three territories by patronisingly telling us territory residents that we ought not to be considered on the same basis as every other Australian citizen, that we ought cop it sweet and accept imposed rules and views because the Commonwealth has a legislative and constitutional obligation with regard to territories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill goes to the core of the individual rights of Australian citizens no matter where they live. I appreciate the diversity of views and opinions on the core issue of euthanasia, which we will have to debate and which we should, very properly, consider in a committee process. Like Senator Collins, I can appreciate that the process of dealing with this in the legal and constitutional committee will mean appropriate consideration. I have been assured by the committee chairman, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Senator Ellison, that the committee will travel and visit as required the territories to get the views and opinions of people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst a reporting date of February will be an onerous task, it will also be important to recognise that the committee will then look at the constitutional, moral and ethical issues of euthanasia on which people like Senator Harradine, Senator Boswell or Senator McGauran would have different perspectives to that of my own and a number of other people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the issue relating to territory and state rights, I find it incomprehensible that any chamber of parliament should  not appropriately recognise other parliaments. That was very adequately demonstrated here in this Senate by the presentation of a remonstrance only several days ago by the parliament of the Northern Territory and by a letter of concern from the parliament of Norfolk Island.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is important that the Senate give consideration to an appropriate and proper committee reference and representation because of those constitutional issue to which we in the Senate have an absolute fundamental obligation. The House of Representatives did not take up that challenge or that opportunity. They walked away from their responsibility in that area. This is an important issue. I want to see the social adjustment issues of euthanasia properly canvassed by the committee. I do want to see the constitutional issues taken into account. I want to see the issues relating particularly to Aboriginal indigenous people of Australia properly canvassed and recognised, and that can only properly be done by the committee in this instance. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>Much has been said recently about the issue of migration. This has been triggered by one maverick from Queensland, the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). She has lit a bushfire and contributed nothing positively to a very critical debate. As days goes by, we see that she has contributed very little because she has no capacity to contribute much. On all grounds of her contribution she has been wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we look at migration and Australia's history of migration, we realise that the immigration program that consecutive governments in this country have presided over has been our greatest single achievement as a nation. Our record is one that we should not shy from. Over 50 years of planned migration, we have brought five million people to this country from 200 or so different ethnic backgrounds. It has been successful. People have come here without the English language or skills. We have found that, very soon after <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5259"> their arrival, they make a fair fist of their new lives here. Already we can talk about one million small businesses in Australia started by non-English speaking migrants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of societal harmony, internationally we are recognised as being unparalleled in the way that Australians from all walks of life come together, live together and get on with each other. What we have seen in recent days is the bushfire of racism lit by Pauline Hanson having debilitating effects on a society which, for over 15 years, we have been very keen to nurture in a very positive way. Migrants have not only brought an infusion of energy to this country but they have changed this country forever. They have changed how we see ourselves and how others see us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When ignorant critics run the line that multiculturalism is a negative in our society, we should always note that Australia has from the start had a multicultural component to it. We have always been a multicultural nation. Be it the diverse communities, languages and cultures of Aboriginal Australians or the first settlers, we were always destined to have to rely on population growth. Because of our size, we were always destined to be a country of migration and diverse migration sources. For instance, our constitution entrenches respect for diversity and, you could say, multiculturalism. Freedom of religion together with the equality of treatment of people are two important planks in our constitution that ensure that, when people have their religion respected, their cultural heritage is respected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have always been, in composition, culturally diverse and we have always had entrenched in our system of constitutional law respect for cultural diversity. It is part of our fair go ethos. That is a critical thing to say at this point. You can have all the laws you want, but it is that fair go ethos, a fair go for other people, that has been quite critical to the way Australians treat each other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should also note the economics of migration. At a time when people are saying that migrants take jobs, we should look at the fact that historically, when we have been in recessions and economic downturns, we have relied on migrants to stimulate growth. We <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have also seen over recent years, for instance, at a time when there has been high unemployment, that those regions that have had population growth are the ones that have had least unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we are recognised as being the most successful migrant country in the world and we compare ourselves with countries like the USA and Canada, I think we should ask ourselves why we have had that degree of success. That leads directly to the discussion of some of the motions we are moving today and some of the regulations that the opposition is seeking to bowl over. We have been most successful because we have had a very deliberate policy of inclusion. We have built on the dedication of migrants to set up a new life and we provide for them a springboard to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Inclusion means quick and easy access to citizenship and the security that citizenship provides to people. Security gives them a platform to start new lives, far from the fear of persecution&mdash;persecution from which at least half a million Australians have directly fled. Citizenship, and reaction to it, is symbolic of a two&hyphen;way commitment. For us, continuation of a policy of ready access in a non&hyphen;discriminatory way to citizenship is quite critical.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our inclusive approach also embodies inclusiveness in a social sense. Family migration has been critical to the success of migration in this country. People need infrastructure and support&mdash;emotional, physical and capital&mdash;when they migrate. Nothing can be more critical to them than having their family around them to support them. Family migration, particularly spousal migration, has been a critical part of our migration policy, to the extent that there has been a bipartisan approach to recognise the sanctity of family and spousal migration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are concerned that in the regulations that are before us today the government has ditched one of the critical platforms of migration policy over the years&mdash;that is, a policy that recognises the right for husband and wife, for spouses, to be together.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The moves here are moves that we will object to. They are moves that are contrary to the Sex <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5260"> Discrimination Act and to international covenants. More importantly, they are contrary to the formation of successful migration through respect for the base family&mdash;the nuclear family, for instance, in this case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We recognise that the role of communities is central to support structures. We also recognise that the government has a role to play in terms of its social justice agenda. We recognise that economic policy, not immigration policy, causes ghettoes. Australians have been prepared over years, over decades, to put an investment into people, to put an investment into our migrants. We recognise that, by putting in that investment at a difficult time, Australia as a nation will benefit. The history of migration in this country shows that we have always benefited from that investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Inclusiveness also means that we do not act in a racially discriminatory way. We should all feel that we have an equal part of the action in our society. The debate that Pauline Hanson has triggered has basically done what she has set out to claim we should not have in our society&mdash;she has divided it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think one of the real problems we have had in respect of this is that there has been a failure of leadership. Any leader worth his or her salt in this society should have realised seven or eight weeks ago that if he did not, as other leaders have done in the past, stamp on the views, argue against them and rebut them solidly, he or she would have had to respond seven or eight weeks down the track, they would have to respond in a position of weakness and a lot of damage would have been done in the meantime. I think it is to the eternal fault of the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, as a leader, that he has not been prepared to do this in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, inclusiveness means being treated equally. One of the real concerns we have with these regulations is in the family reunion area. Family reunion, as I said, is critical to migration. There has to be a sense that people can equally sponsor their families. How can you justify a situation where, if these regulations are not knocked off today, some families with an English speaking background can have their parents, grandparents, brothers and sisters allowed into this country, sharing <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> houses with them, while, across the road, next&hyphen;door or in the same street, people from a non&hyphen;English speaking background would be denied the opportunity to have their families live with them? It is iniquitous, it is discriminatory and it is racially discriminatory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a reintroduction of the old English language test, the old dictation test. Through the mechanisms that this government is pursuing by adding the factor of English language points to the concessional family category, you are denying many people from a non&hyphen;English speaking background the opportunity to come to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The impact of introducing English language points for the concessional family category will be deep and it will be recognised within Australian society and outside Australia. For instance, the projections I have seen, which are quite reliable and which the department has made available to us through the estimates process, indicate that because of this regulation the number of people from a non&hyphen;English speaking background coming in under the concessional family category will decrease dramatically. Whereas at the moment the figure is 63 per cent, it will go down to just over 30 per cent. Migration from places like Beijing and Shanghai in the concessional family category will be halved; from Ho Chi Minh City, it will be halved; from Beirut, one in five in the concessional family category who came in the past will not be able to come in the future. From Athens&mdash;and here we are talking particularly of people from other parts of Europe coming through Athens&mdash;50 per cent of non&hyphen;English speaking migrants in the concessional category who otherwise would qualify and have qualified in the past will not be able to come. The number from Belgrade will be cut by two&hyphen;thirds in terms of the concessional family category.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With this particular regulation the government is introducing discrimination into our migration program. When we look at the figures&mdash;and we will be tracking these figures very closely, as we have already in the estimates process&mdash;it can be found that John Howard said in 1988 that he wanted to moderate the flow of Asian migration. And the introduction of the English language in the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5261"> concessional family category does that. Eight years later he has found a way, not just against Asian migration but against non&hyphen;English speaking migration from all parts of the world. That is our critical objection to this aspect of the regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might also say that in just a few short months this government have made a complete botch of the migration program. Not only have they eroded the spousal part of family migration, which is a critical aspect of migration, but they have also brought in discrimination between families. They have made the program almost impossible to manage. This is now being realised throughout the community and, can I say in regard to the discriminatory aspect, throughout the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On migration, those opposite have responded to base populism in our community; they have kicked this stalking&hyphen;horse around the community for electoral advantage with an eye to the polls. But the reality is that a critical part of the Australian migration program is now unworkable because of this response to base populism. Any government worth their salt should not respond in this way. They should factor in the views of the community, as we always do in our consultations on the migration program. At the same time the government should have a program that is manageable, but this minister has failed in that respect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us put these regulations in context. We have allowed much of what the government has proposed by way of regulation but, where there has been a breach of policy commitment or where there has been no disclosure before the election, then we seek the right to overturn the regulations that reflect those breaches of commitment and that dishonesty through deliberately withholding issues from the public before the election. For instance, we have accepted the extension of the six&hyphen;month waiting period for new arrivals to two years which the coalition announced before the election. With issues which were not covered by their policy before the election, obviously we seek to reject them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have accepted increased sureties under the assurance of support provision, but we <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> object to the government double dipping by excluding people from benefits in the first two years while at the same time trying to require assurance of support against the likelihood of drawing on social security benefits from which they are excluded. We have accepted the government's authority in the decision to control the size of the program and the composition of the program, except where it conflicts with basic human rights such as family reunions in particular.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of family reunions, can I remind the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) here, and the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock), the minister responsible, that it is an amazing development in Australian migration policy for him to seek to have the power to cap the number of spouse visas granted in any one year. I remind Mr Ruddock of what he had to say about capping spousal visas in 1989 when amendments were introduced to make it perfectly plain and to remove the possibility of doubt that these visa classes would not be capped. Mr Ruddock said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I regard it as absolutely unconscionable for a government to say half way through the year, `We have enough spouses in now, we are going to close off that category and no more people in that category can come to Australia&mdash;no more husbands and wives, no more dependent children, or aged parents'. I am glad that the Minister has made the decision to exclude those groups.</PARA>
<PARA>We will try to hold Mr Ruddock to that as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have accepted the decision to raise substantially visa application fees, although there are sound reasons for criticising these measures. We have accepted the introduction of a two&hyphen;year probationary visa for offshore spouse applications, and we support this being applied to offshore de facto spouse applicants. We have accepted the introduction of 20 additional points for English language skills for the skill independent category. It has now been decided not to proceed with the disallowance of regulations 13.5 to 13.9.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we are concerned about a number of critical issues. We are concerned about the regulation that seeks to amend the balance of family test requiring a parent to be sponsored <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5262"> by a majority of the children of that parent in Australia. We believe that the existing requirement of at least 50 per cent provides sufficiently rigorous control. Any further tightening may appear to be minimal, but it makes it impossible for families who have two children but only one child in Australia to sponsor parents. It is insensitive to cultural obligations. Let us keep in mind that quite often, if not always in these cases, they do not impact financially upon the Australian taxpayer as there are in place preclusions from social security and non&hyphen;refundable health charges payable in advance in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of regulations 10 and 11, we are concerned and we object to including in the schedule of assurances of support a widows allowance. The widows allowance quite often would be claimed because of a situation&mdash;obviously not anticipated before the person came to this country&mdash;where a person becomes a widow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to regulation 13.3, the New Zealand provisions, this regulation deletes the families of New Zealand citizens from schedule 1. The effect of this will be that New Zealand citizens migrating to Australia will not be able to sponsor members of the immediate family if such members themselves are not New Zealand citizens. To accept such an amendment would be inconsistent with our opposition to the general principle that only Australian citizens can sponsor a spouse, dependent child or parent and so on. As a consequence we oppose regulation 13.3 together with regulations 20, 47 and 55. We do not believe there needs to be a precondition of citizenship before one can nominate for migration such a close family member, whether from New Zealand or any other part of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regulations 14 to 19 seek to introduce the requirement of citizenship to sponsor preferential family. This provision is a breach of a pre&hyphen;election commitment. Quite often, Senator Short made it very clear that this sort of requirement would not be brought in. Let us face it: one of the major reasons for this provision is to target Chinese migration&mdash;the parents and families of those who manage to qualify under the 1 November decision of the previous government. It is those people who <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will suffer the most because of this particular provision. We do not believe that this provision should be pursued because of the impact it will have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that it would be wrong to attach citizenship with such basic rights. We have always taken the approach that in Australia citizenship should be a willing choice; it should not be forced on people. This regulation forces people to make a commitment to this country whereas, in the past, the concept of willing choice has been most successful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is looking at establishing a council on citizenship. On occasions, the government has expressed the view that eligibility for citizenship should be extended from the current two years and that factors, such as a high level of functional English, should be among the criteria for eligibility. We believe that such developments would be an unhealthy deviation from our approach to the creation of our society over recent years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are further problems on the horizon if any parliament is prepared to accept regulations 14 to 19. Those regulations are a breach of an election commitment. They are discriminatory in their application. More fundamentally, it would be wrong to attach citizenship with such basic rights, such as permanent resident status which, in the past, has entitled a person to a lifetime stay in Australia and to sponsorship. We do not think we should take things to the extent the government is proposing with these regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us keep in mind that, to do so, would impose undue hardship on many people&mdash;people who have made a commitment to this country but who, for one reason or another, do not want to lose the rights of another country. In the absence of a clean approach to dual citizenship, they would be in fear of losing rights of inheritance and the like if they were forced to take up citizenship here. If this particular provision were to go ahead, those people would be denied the capacity to reunite with spouses or dependent children for an intolerable amount of time. For a range of grounds, we oppose this provision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another aspect of regulations 14 to 19 is that they make it compulsory to demand an assurance of support whereas, in the past, it <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5263"> has been discretionary and non&hyphen;compulsory. Already, people are having problems with that provision and those regulations. Already families are being separated. One particular case, which has come to my attention in recent days, is that of a Tasmanian woman who married a US citizen on 25 June this year and is now seeking to bring her husband to Australia to begin family life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under these new regulations, that woman is required to provide an assurance of support for her husband, something never before demanded with respect to husbands and wives of Australian citizens. This woman is a qualified teacher but, because she is pregnant, her child being due next March, she is not acceptable to this government, she is not acceptable to this department, for the purpose of giving an assurance of support. She is not in a position to sponsor her husband because her income flow and other factors deny her eligibility to give an assurance of support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This woman's only other close relative, her mother, also is not able to sign an assurance of support. She is retired but, although she is prepared to pledge equity in her home, she is not in a position to meet the government's requirements for a person giving an assurance of support. These are the sorts of cases that will come up time and time again, not in their fives or tens or hundreds but in their thousands, if this government's proposals to deny people the capacity to sponsor their spouses go ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the sort of divided society that the government is creating, a society where people cannot bring in their spouses, where Australian citizens cannot bring in their spouses. As I said, this is one instance but, if the government's provisions were to go ahead, making it more rigorous and more difficult for people to sponsor spouses, we will be hearing of similar cases through our media night after night.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The government says that we need to do this because there has been a blow&hyphen;out in the number of spouses coming to Australia and rorting the system. But when asked about this by us&mdash;not once but a number of times&mdash;in the estimates committee process, all that the officials representing the minister for immi gration could point to by way of evidence were 108 cases out of a 40,000 intake over two years. Fair dinkum, that is a pretty low number&mdash;low to the extent that the previous government was actually looking at ways of facilitating entry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government can point to only 108 cases being pursued out of an intake of 40,000 over two years in order to justify this inept, incompetent policy, they have to look at it again. They have to revisit this policy because it is not just words on paper, it is people's lives that they are affecting here. They are going right to the heart of family migration via an incompetent and inept policy, a policy that demands of people that they be separated despite the fact that a partner is an Australian citizen. It makes it impossible for them, as is the case with this Tasmanian woman, to unite with their spouses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That woman is in real danger of having this child while her husband is out of the country. Why? Because the government's silly, inept and ill thought out policies will deny her access to her husband. These are the sorts of objections we have heard&mdash;real life objections&mdash;to the government's proposals and regulations. That is why we say that the Senate has a responsibility to look very keenly at them and to look at the incompetence of the minister in pursing policies like it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is one reason why, in the past, we have had spousal migration and sponsorship dependent on permanent residence and not on citizenship. I say to the government: go back, you are going the wrong way; think it through again and come back with a new set of proposals. What we have heard of today with this Tasmanian woman we will see often in the future unless the government reconsiders this stupid policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regulations 48, 49, 51, 53 and 54 introduce citizenship requirements, compulsory assurance of support for onshore children, onshore aged parents, onshore families and onshore spouses, extended eligibility for temporary visas, and so on. What is the logic in it? What are they trying to achieve?</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5264">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Are you trying to keep kids separated from their parents? Are you trying to artificially keep parents separated from their adult children? I am sure the department has been driven to this by a policy from the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), a policy driven by pollsters and a policy which demands of him to beat the migrant can as much as he can. What is the impact of it? You are going to separate families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a government that was elected on the basis of family policy, and this is a government that will die in migration policy because the impact of that policy will be to keep families separate. This policy, as I said earlier, will deny this Tasmanian woman the presence of her husband at the birth of her child. That is just one example of the direct implication of your policies and your regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We could go on. We can look at regulations 21 to 36. There have already been massive inroads to the humanitarian program. It has already been cut. There has been some fanciful argument about cuts from what it was expected to be, and so on. But the reality is that there are 3,000 less humanitarian cases coming in this year than there were last year. So, what do you want to do? You now want to include in the humanitarian program families that are sponsored by refugees and special humanitarian visa holders. It is another way of cutting our commitment to international humanitarian situations and crises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Let us go to the issue of English language points. There is so much to talk about in terms of these regulations. I talked earlier about the impact of the English language on the concessional category&mdash;the English language requirement and points for English language capacity. What you will do there is not just keep non-English speaking people out, but you will lower the standard for those with English language. Your program numbers are closely the same. By denying those of non-English background access to the program, there will be more places available for those of English background. So, if you are of English background, you will get in with little more than secondary school educa tion. If you are not of English background, you are going to need a lot more than that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will tell you something: the history of migration here and the history of commerce in the world is that you do not need to know English to make a buck. You do not need to know English to be a successful business person. If you go through the whole raft of successful Australian business entrepreneurs, so many of them came here without English. But you will be discriminating against those people in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regulation 144&mdash;I am skipping a few because we are running out of time&mdash;is particularly offensive. It seeks to make citizenship requirement and balance of family test retrospective to 3 July 1996. It is retrospective. It does so in a contrived and twisted route, hoping to get around section 48 of the Acts Interpretation Act, which provides that these regulations cannot be retrospective. Disallowance will ensure that this retrospectivity cannot occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will finish on this particular point: nothing has been more critical to migration than government support; and nothing is more critical in terms of government support than English language. When you look at DEETYA and the immigration department together, this government is spending less in this budget on English language services than the previous government did&mdash;though it came in with the commitment to spend more. You have ripped the guts out of English language programs in DEETYA and, as a consequence, migrants are not going to get the critical service they need in terms of English language services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, you want to raise English language charges. You are going to rip a lot more money out of them&mdash;from $2,200 concessional charge this year&mdash;for which 90 per cent of users of the programs are eligible&mdash;to $4,400 on 1 October, and $5,500 on 1 January 1997, if you get your legislation through in respect of that. Let us be realistic about this. If you are dinkum about creating a harmonious society, you should not make it more difficult for people to access English language programs, and you should not be ripping from them, at a time when they are <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5265"> pretty low on resources, the resources they need for those programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I fear that the directions taken by this government on migration are going to be quite destructive to the sort of society we have built together over the last 50 years. Malcolm Fraser would not have embarked down this road. That is the final charge you can lay against this minister and this Prime Minister&mdash;that Malcolm Fraser would not have touched this with a 10-foot barge pole. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to delay the Senate unduly on this matter, but it is a very important matter. It is particularly important in the context of the much wider disgraceful debate that is happening in certain sections of our community&mdash;a debate that started prior to the election and, unfortunately, was fuelled by some comments by various candidates for political office during the election. It is a debate that, unfortunately, has continued since the election with the election of some members to the  parliament of Australia and comments that they have made since they have been elected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The community is debating immigration in Australia. I do not have a problem with that. In fact, in all of my time as a member of parliament, I have encouraged debate about immigration and what happens to migrants when they come to this country. I make those comments for the very simple reason that there will be people in the parliament who will welcome the changes that are foreshadowed with these regulations being brought in by the government. They will indeed be applauding them because of the impact that the regulations will have on various migrants who arrive here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make the point very strongly that the opposition is not standing in the way of all of the changes that the government is proposing in the area of immigration. For example, they have proposed an extension of the six-month waiting period for certain benefits which new arrivals receive. We are not opposing those matters which they gave notice of prior to the election, when they said in their policy statements, `We are going to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> institute these measures if we are elected.' We are not opposing these measures. Those measures were subject to scrutiny by the Senate Legal and  Constitutional Legislation Committee earlier in the year in a report that I believe was tabled in August, and which has sat there since then. Indeed, the bill has sat on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>; it has not been brought on for debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not opposing certain measures that were contained in that bill. But the government saw its opportunity to expand upon the two-year waiting period, without any form of consultation with the community, and we have indicated our opposition to those additional measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By our opposition to the measures and regulations that Senator Bolkus has alluded to, we are clearly stating that we support families. Not only are we getting up and mouthing the words, `We support families,' but we are turning those words into actions by speaking against the regulations and voting for the disallowance of those regulations that attack migrants in our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to delay the Senate unduly, but I want to emphasise the last point Senator Bolkus raised in his excellent contribution to this debate which related to the education charge. The concessional rate which applied under the previous government was based on a charge of $2,005, for which 90 per cent of users of the program were eligible. The regulation, as foreshadowed by the government, would withdraw that concessional rate. As of 1 October, the rate rose to $4,405. If the amendments to the Immigration (Education) Charge Act go through, from 1 January 1997, which is not long away now, that fee will rise to $5,500, which is an increase from $2,205 to $5,500. That is quite an extraordinary increase by any measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Taking that with the coalition's attempt to remove all support for new arrivals for the first two years after they come to this country seems fundamentally misguided. The community has told the government that it is misguided. If we are to have a migration program&mdash;and I certainly support that&mdash;it is important to make sure that people are able to successfully make the transition from their <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5266"> previous home to their new home in this country. To do that, some people will need access to education programs&mdash;programs to assist with English language skills and programs to assist them enter the labour market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Any short&hyphen;term savings that are made in this area are likely to create a long-term problem if the result is that new arrivals find themselves unable to make a successful transition and therefore become long-term losers who are alienated from mainstream society and are welfare dependent. That does not seem like the recipe for a sensible approach. These regulation amendments would result in the diminution of settlement support. It would further disadvantage people from non-English speaking posts from having the opportunity to enter the work force and to participate in this society generally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is inconsistent with the coalition's pre&hyphen;election promises to improve access to English language programs. The coalition described them as the glue that holds Australia together. Senator Short, who is in the chamber, would well recall those words. I recall Senator Short being on stage in north Perth during the election campaign and enunciating that they are the glue that holds Australia together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Everybody knows that you won the election and we lost it. You went into the election campaign with commitments that are not now being fulfilled with these regulations which were enunciated in the budget. Those commitments are not being fulfilled. You stand condemned because you have not sought to fulfil those commitments. I was going to say some kind words about Senator Vanstone, but I do not think that we will re&hyphen;open that argument again.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This motion is somewhat unprecedented and misguided. It is the first time that a government's migration policy arrangements, since they were put into legislative form, have been the subject of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sustained and constant attack by an opposition. It is worth mentioning at the commencement of the debate that Senator Bolkus has indicated that the opposition accepts the overall immigration target that the new government has established and yet refuses to allow the government to implement measures to actually achieve that target. In other words, he wants to have the best of both worlds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an impossible task to say to a government, `Yes we  agree that your modest reduction in the immigration intake is reasonable and yes we agree that your target of 74,000 is not unreasonable, but no we will not let you implement measures to achieve that target nor do we have any proposals as to how you should achieve that target.' In my view, that is incompetence in the extreme. If you say that 74,000 is a reasonable target&mdash;and I think there is agreement on that&mdash;and you want to block these measures and stop an elected government implementing a program, the net result of which you agree with, what do you want done? Where are your proposals to achieve a target of 74,000?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before moving to some remarks that I would like the Democrats to pay some attention to, I would like to make two remarks relating to Ms Hanson. Senator Bolkus chose to yet again give Ms Hanson the prominence that, in my view, she does not deserve. It is a frequent tactic of the opposition to despise her views but nonetheless keep raising them and keep giving her opportunities to get coverage. He neglected to mention something that I think should be mentioned&mdash;that is, that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) when Leader of the Opposition ensured that Ms Hanson was disendorsed as a Liberal candidate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a serious move to make during an election campaign. When you have got an endorsed candidate you cannot put another one in; you are stuck with that person. There is no clearer a statement by a leader than to say, `That person is not standing under our banner. We would rather lose the seat than have that person in our party.' So let's not come in here and pretend that the Prime Minister endorses Ms Hanson. I do not believe such a thing has ever happened in the Labor Party&mdash;I have not bothered to check the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5267"> history&mdash;but it certainly stands out as a most unusual event during a campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We did not know whether we were going to win the election. Everybody here knows this. We hoped we were going to win, but in 1993 we thought we were going to win and did not. In 1996 we were very cautious. We had no idea that we would win by the huge majority that we did. Sure, a week or so before the election we thought we were going to win but, as I said, we had thought that before. There was no certainty about the numbers. In those circumstances&mdash;not these circumstances now, where we have a very significant majority&mdash;where it was not sure, the then Leader of the Opposition said, `That person is not standing under our banner, out. We would rather lose that seat than have someone with those views purporting to be a Liberal.' I do not think you can make a clearer statement as leader of an opposition. Yet still, members opposite come back and invite the Prime Minister to constantly address Ms Hanson's misguided remarks seriatim, so that every time she says something she gets on the front page of the newspapers. That is what happens when a Prime Minister responds to you&mdash;you get on the front page.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This has been a misguided approach by the Labor Party. I do not believe that Ms Hanson's views represent the Labor Party's views, and I certainly know they do not represent my party's views. If you want to keep giving her publicity, keep asking the Prime Minister to respond to her. If you want to use her politically, you keep doing it. I think that needs to be put on the record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Overnight I delved down to the depths of my goodwill to try to find something positive that I could say to Senator Bolkus with respect to this whole matter of these regulations. I had not actually found anything to say until he spoke and raised the matter of Ms Hanson. I do not mind saying that I think it was Senator Bolkus, as the former minister in this area and I think now the shadow minister, who was asked a view of Ms Hanson and who said, `I think she'd be better sticking to fish and chips.' A certain degree of warmth came over me towards Senator Bolkus on that occasion, and I freely admit it has not re turned since. Nonetheless, I thought at the time that that was pretty well spot-on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having dealt with that matter, let me come back to the point about the migration program. As I understand it, the Labor opposition agrees with this target but is simply saying to the government, `We're not going to let you implement it. We are going to say no to this box and dice. You are out of the ballpark, you cannot have it.' The consequences of that are to stay with the program as is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are seeking a modest reduction in the migration program, from about 83,000 to about 74,000. What we are seeking to do is restore the balance between the skilled and family reunion categories. We understand that Labor is not going to support us. But we do hope that the Democrats and the two Green parties&mdash;as I now understand we are to refer to the Greens&mdash;and Senator Harradine consider this seriously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will address the Democrat's policies for a moment. If the Democrats were not to support this, if they were to prevent the government from delivering a program of 74,000, it would seem to be inconsistent with their own immigration policy which, as I understand it, is a policy of net zero migration. I further understand that this policy has been the subject of three separate ballots of the membership and has roughly 80 per cent support. The Democrat's Internet home page indicates that until a sustainable population can be achieved, a low level of immigration should be continued. It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . with the annual number of immigrants (including refugees) not exceeding the number of permanent departures of the previous year. Refugees should be given the highest priority in immigration.</PARA>
<PARA>The National President of the Australian Democrats, Tony Fountain, in a letter to the editor just recently, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The policy of the Australian Democrats on immigration is, in essence, that our numbers coming into the country should equal in any one year those of the people leaving.</PARA>
<PARA>To fulfil this policy it would mean a program of just below 30,000. The government is seeking to implement a program of 74,000, and the Democrat's policy would lead one to a program of a mere 30,000. So it is difficult <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5268"> to see how the Democrats could endorse a policy that would lead you to an immigration intake of 30,000, yet prevent a government shifting from 83,000 down to 74,000. It is very hard to see how that could be realistically justified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is at the moment unrealistic to try to shift to anything like the Democrat's policy. To deliver a program of 30,000, you need to give, they say, a priority to refugee entrants. We have 6,000 refugee entrants, 14,000 for humanitarian and refugee entrants. There are 12,000 New Zealanders seeking permanent residence in Australia, which is unregulated entry, which leaves a balance of only 12,000 for the rest of the program.    </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year there were some 33,500 spouses and fiances in the program. Without the measures this government has proposed, these numbers will not be contained. So without even the spousal measures, the Democrats are going to exceed their own policy commitment by roughly 20,000. Under the Democrats policy, not even all the spouses and fiances could be accommodated, because they want to give a preference to the refugee and humanitarian intake. That is an important point for the Democrats to consider.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the Democrats proposal, assuming last year's level of demand, each year 12,500 spouses and fiances would not be able to enter Australia. Within a mere five-year period, there would be a queue of 107,500 spouses and fiances waiting to be reunited with their partners. For a program of 30,000, it would be necessary to abolish the categories of dependent and adopted children, parents, brothers and sisters, last remaining relatives, special need relatives and all the skilled categories, including business migrants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have tried to indicate to the Democrats why we do not think we could realistically move to your policy as it now stands. We do ask the Democrats to reconsider your policy&mdash;that is, no more in than leave. That would ask you to endorse a policy of about 30,000. We are asking to shift from 83,000 to 74,000. We ask you to bear that in mind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come back to an earlier point I made. The opposition says that this is a reasonable target <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to move to, but it refuses to allow us to implement that target and does not come up with an alternative implementation plan to achieve it. The irony is that the measures the opposition is seeking to remove are required because of its own mismanagement of the migration program. The further irony is that Senator Bolkus is the one who, as minister, presided over the mismanagement of the program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has the new government inherited? We have inherited the legacy of a migration program which is in what state? The migration program has become dominated by the family stream, and we believe community support for that domination has been lost&mdash;not community support for the migration program but community support for the domination of it by the family stream. That is what has been lost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The family stream was allowed to grow by 27 per cent during 1995-96. The effect of that was that it made up almost 70 per cent of the program, with a growth of 32 per cent in the number of spouse visas granted and a growth of 74 per cent in the number of parent visas granted. This growth was allowed to occur at the expense of the skilled stream of the program. This was not adding on a family section and maintaining the skilled section&mdash;it was at the expense of the skilled section.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following the election in March, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Mr Ruddock, had very extensive consultations with a wide range of groups, including state and territory governments, business and industry groups, unions, environmental bodies, welfare organisations, church groups and representatives of Australia's migrant communities. On 3 July this year, the government announced that its program would include about 74,000 places. That is what we wanted, and we understand that there is agreement on the total. We wanted a skilled stream of 28,000, preferential family of 36,700, concessional family of 8,000 and special eligibility of 1,300. This program, therefore, is close to the average program level of the last four years, which is 72,550.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just before I leave the question of the make-up of the program, I return to some <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5269"> remarks Senator Bolkus made. He sought to imply, without having the stomach to say it directly, that somehow the government was shifting to a racially based immigration intake because of certain changes we have sought to make to the English requirements. That is what he was seeking to say, but he could not bring himself to come straight to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First of all, we believe that the figures Senator Bolkus used with respect to those matters&mdash;the requirements for English, making a contribution, et cetera&mdash;are overstated. What Senator Bolkus did not say&mdash;and this is why they ask you to tell the truth and the whole truth when you go to court&mdash;was that the previous government recognised the need for migrants to have English language skills as a key to accessing employment. The Labor Party recognised that. If it is discriminatory to seek to introduce this English factors measure, how is it that the Labor government was prepared to introduce it for independent and business skilled migrants? Why is it good enough for some people and not good enough for others? That is the fickleness, the two-facedness and the shallowness of the debate we have heard this morning from Senator Bolkus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nonetheless, let me move on. How did we develop this migration program? We saw the need to restore the balance between family and skilled streams in the context of maintaining the non-discriminatory selection criteria. High and sustained levels of unemployment in the preferential family category had to be taken into account. There is evidence that English language skills are a key factor impacting on employment prospects and the overall settlement success of migrants. We had to take into account the costs associated with the rising number of parents within the program that need to be contained. And it was essential that changes be made to the selection criteria within the family stream to reduce the component of the program to an acceptable size. Under Labor in previous years, the family component zoomed up at the expense of the skills program. What we are doing is seeking to redress that balance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The measures contained in these statutory rules which are designed to achieve this <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> include the provision to allow refugees and humanitarian entrants to be reunited with their immediate family in Australia under the humanitarian program with attendant benefits and access to settlement services. Under the former government, many of these people had to be able to satisfy the criteria for selection within the general migration program without the advantages of being included within the humanitarian program. A further irony in this area is that the measures are substantially similar to the measures announced by Senator Bolkus in January this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a requirement that, generally, sponsors in the preferential family category be Australian citizens. In the current situation, where this demand driven category has grown to an unacceptable size and to constitute an unacceptable proportion of the program, it is reasonable to reduce this demand through recognition that the right to sponsor family members to become part of Australian society be acknowledged as a privilege only available to those who have made a public commitment to Australia by becoming an Australian citizen. To ensure a tighter balance of family tests for parents wishing to join their children within Australia, a clear majority of their children must be living in Australia. This change recognises the need to reduce the number of persons entering Australia who have the potential to become a burden on the Australian taxpayer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be full cost recovery for English language tuition charges payable by certain migrants. This measure removes concessional rates that applied to certain applicants and removes exemption in respect of some onshore residence classes to bring them into line with the equivalent offshore classes. Before the election, we indicated that we would be applying full cost recovery principles in the adult English language program. This change recognises the need for migrants to take greater responsibility for the cost of their post&hyphen;arrival services, such as the provision of English tuition.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Refugee, humanitarian and preferential family visa holders remain exempt from this charge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5270"> There are measures to ensure that sponsors in the preferential family category appropri ately abide by their commitments to support these programs. It is not unreasonable  to ask people to abide by their commitments. The changes require sponsors in the preferential class to pay a bond which acts as a surety in respect of social security benefits, such as a special benefit. Requiring sponsors to provide an undertaking without the payment of a bond has not been successful in getting sponsors to meet their responsibilities, with the result that the Australian taxpayer has had to shoulder them. Similarly, preferential family applicants in respect of whom a bond is payable will also have to pay the health services charge, which operates in tandem with the assurance of support arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is the inclusion of an English language factor in the points test for concessional family applicants. Senator Bolkus sought to make so much of that without mentioning his own government's recognition of the English language and the benefits or greater opportunities for migrants that it creates. This was foreshadowed in the government's election platform. The concessional family category is predominantly a skilled entry category designed to supplement the Australian labour market with relatively skilled migrants. That is what concessional family applicants are all about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Points for the English language will be a relatively small portion of the total. Points will continue to be awarded for education skills and family connections. English language ability has been a factor in the selection of concessional family migrants for many years through the list of occupations requiring English. But putting English in the points tests allows it to be considered along with a range of other factors that are relevant to successful settlement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is the removal of a loophole which has allowed almost any non&hyphen;citizen temporarily within Australia to apply for a migrant visa offshore and to remain in Australia as the holder of a bridging visa, often with work rights and access to Medicare, until the migrant application is finally decided. This has been a loophole. A growing number of such migrant applications are being lodged by persons within Australia. If the number <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> continues to grow at the current rate, control of the migration program may well be compromised. These people enter Australia on a temporary visa, the expectation being that if they decide to migrate permanently to Australia they will pursue their application offshore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is the introduction of a two&hyphen;year probationary visa for spouses and interdependency applicants offshore, in line with the current practice onshore. This is in response to the government's and the community's concern at instances of the use of the offshore spouse provisions for non&hyphen;bona fide relationships. Contrived marriages and especially organised marriage rackets remain a major concern to the integrity of the program. This measure, coupled with increased assessment of the bona fides of offshore applicants, will go a long way to restoring the community's confidence in the way this category is being used.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also included in the Migration Regulations (Amendment) are a number of other less important changes and technical amendments. Other measures to facilitate better management of the program are contained in the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1996. That bill includes provision for there to be much more flexible powers when it comes to limiting the number of visas that can be granted in the program year in a particular visa class or classes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government requires the full range of measures I have spoken about if Australia is to achieve its goals of a balanced migration program and one which has public confidence. I repeat: the public has lost confidence in a migration program where the skills aspect has been allowed to diminish and where the family stream has taken over. The public has not lost confidence in a migration program but in one with that emphasis. That public confidence needs to be restored and it can be by returning to a more balanced program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following the announcement of the program in July, it is already evident from the application rates in certain categories that the government's plans to deliver a better migration program are being understood. Application rates in the preferential family <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5271"> category during the first quarter of this year are down by 14 per cent on the number of applicants last year. Should the disallowance motion moved by Senator Bolkus be passed, it will have the effect of doing away with all the initiatives I have mentioned in detail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been advised that the view of the opposition is, nonetheless, that they do not disagree with the measure to introduce a probationary visa for spouse and interdependency classes offshore. However, in seeking to disallow the Australian citizenship sponsorship requirement, the regulations relating to the two&hyphen;year probationary visa have also been included because of the way the regulations have been drafted. It is my understanding that if this most unfortunate disallowance motion does succeed, the opposition will cooperate in assisting the government to immediately restore the regulations relating to the two&hyphen;year probationary visa. The government has adopted appropriate measures in order to achieve a very sensible balance between the family and skilled migration streams within the 1996&hyphen;97 program. The opposition has indicated that it agrees with the overall size of the program. The Democrats policy would have the program halved beyond what we suggest&mdash;more than halved, actually&mdash;as I understand it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This disallowance motion seeks to destroy the measures designed to achieve the size of that program. So, yes, we agree with the size of the program but, no, we do not agree with how you are going to do it&mdash;and, no, we have no other proposals. This government is committed to the program it announced on 3 July 1996, both in size and in balance. Disallowance of the regulations would require the government to control the program through other measures. The only substantial measures currently available are the present inflexible capping powers in the Migration Act 1958. We are seeking more flexible powers in the Migration Legislation  Amendment Bill (No. 3), but the opposition has already foreshadowed that they may oppose those measures. I reiterate that Labor caused this problem. It let the balance in the program get out of control. This government is trying to fix it and what the previous government that made <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the mess is trying to do is sabotage a very sensible solution with a migration program of about 74,000 and the proper skills balance restored.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats support the disallowance motion that has been moved by Senator Bolkus regarding the migration regulation statutory rules 211 and 213. I am glad that the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) has been reading our policies and surfing the Net, though I give a word of caution: the last time the minister surfed the Net on the Democrat home page she had to apologise to us&mdash;but I see no inconsistency between Democrat policy and what we are doing today. The minister has referred to the policy&mdash;our policy is quite clear. We do support&mdash;we do not oppose&mdash;a reduction in the number of migrants coming to Australia. The minister quoted our policy which states about migration levels:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . shall not exceed that number that will allow the population of Australia to be stabilised at a level which is consistent with an indefinitely sustainable environment. Until a sustainable population is achieved, a low level of immigration will be continued with the annual number of immigrants set so as not to exceed the number of permanent departures of the previous year. Refugees should be given the highest priority in immigration.</PARA>
<PARA>On that point, for a start, we are quite obviously and fundamentally at odds with the government's program which seems to be geared towards economically rationalised immigrants. Senator Vanstone referred to Senator Bolkus and urged that he tell the whole truth and not just little bits, so I continue. Our policy also states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We also believe that the processing of applicants and the selection of new migrants will be non&hyphen;discriminatory, that high quality post arrival educational and orientation services should be provided and recognition of qualifications, linked with the right of reciprocity for Australian qualifications and based upon careful assessment of course content, curricula and requirements and professional trade experience will be provided.</PARA>
<PARA>So this debate today is not simply about numbers&mdash;in fact it is not about numbers; it is about means. It is about ensuring that our migration policy is of a non&hyphen;discriminatory <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5272"> nature. That is a very clear part of the Australian Democrats policy. There is nothing at all in the Australian Democrats policy statement which states that any measure at all is permissible to reduce our migrant intake, particularly not discrimination. I do note with interest the comments of the now Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Mr Ruddock, back in 1989 when I believe he was the shadow immigration minister. During the second reading debate on the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill, back in 1989, he stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am pleased to be able to participate in a debate where, as a result of what is called a bipartisan approach we hae been able largely to agree on important legislation and important amendments to improve that legislation. I think it is important that people understand what is meant by `bipartisan'. First it does not mean that the Government hands down on tablets its view and can immediately assume that in all respects it will be accepted by the loyal opposition.</PARA>
<PARA>On 1 June 1989 he also stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I regard it as absolutely unconscionable for a government to say half way through the year, `We have enough spouses in now, we are going to close off the category and no more people in that category can come to Australia&mdash;no more husbands and wives, no more dependent children or aged parents. I am glad that the Minister has made the decision to exclude those groups. We have saved the Government great agony had it persisted in that area. It certainly is a matter that would have attracted a great deal of adverse criticism.</PARA>
<PARA>Those comments were made by the then shadow minister, Philip Ruddock, now the minister. It seems to me that he is quite blatantly contradicting a viewpoint that he held while he was in opposition. How times have changed! What does the attainment of office seem to do to people around here?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For us, the governing principle is that while the Australian Democrats support the prerogative of the government to set the numbers for the levels of immigration, we do not support policies which implement those levels through discriminatory means. We will always reserve our right to monitor the way the government intends to implement its policies. We should never divorce ourselves from the impact that immigration policies have on the lives of people. We have heard examples of real life <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> stories&mdash;Senator Bolkus referred to them today here in this chamber. It is about means today, not about numbers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important and worth noting that the Democrats have also supported many immigration measures put forward by this government and other governments, particularly those measures stipulated in statutory rules 112 and 213. Among others, we also have accepted a two&hyphen;year probationary visa for offshore spouse, de facto and interdependency applications. So we are not intentionally opposing all immigration measures put forward by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn now to some of the specific objections of the Australian Democrats to some of the regulations that are up for disallowance. In regard to the balance of the family test and its expansion, the Democrats do not support that. We find it quite an offensive and oppressive measure. The imposition of the test that says children can only sponsor their parents if more than 50 per cent of those parents' children are Australian citizens we consider unnecessarily harsh. We also consider it an important citizenship issue, and I will turn to other citizenship issues and questions later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But to a large extent, if implemented, this regulation will have an arbitrary effect. Can honourable senators imagine what it would be like for a family of five to assure that three of their children were Australian citizens before they were eligible to sponsor? Surely the governing principle here is that the assurances of support are adequate to safeguard Australian taxpayers from becoming a financial liability to our society in which they have not made a significant contribution. Surely these assurances of support are adequate protection. By any stretch of the imagination, the current levels of assurances of support, coupled with the recent increases, are more than adequate to meet those concerns. That is the Australian Democrats' position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In regard to Australian citizens and the issue of Australian citizens versus permanent residents, a number of regulations, namely, regulations 13.3, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 37, 47, 48, 49, 51, 53, 54, 55, 74, 77.16, 77.19, 78, 85 and 119 are all amended to make only Australian citizens eligible for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5273"> certain classes of visa and/or sponsorship. In negotiations with the government, the Democrats have made clear our concerns about this provision. We have made clear that we have concerns that these matters, potentially, are in breach of the Race Discrimination Act 1975. Honourable senators will appreciate that in the recent political climate, it is essential that not only are our immigration policies non&hyphen;discriminatory, but that there is a reasonable perception of that non&hyphen;discriminatory principle. In this regard and in light of Australia's less than proud history in this respect&mdash;and Senator Bolkus referred to the rather infamous and inappropriate White Australia Policy&mdash;there is a strict onus upon all Australian governments to ensure that beyond a doubt, our immigration policy is non&hyphen;discriminatory. The government have fallen way short in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me clarify what I mean by `non&hyphen;discriminatory' because there exists an apparent ambiguity around this place as to what this actually means. By non&hyphen;discriminatory, I mean:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That any enactment involving a distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of any human right or fundamental freedom in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life is discriminatory.</PARA>
<PARA>Furthermore:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If, by reason of, or of a provision of, a law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory, persons of a particular race, colour or national or ethnic origin do not enjoy a right that is enjoyed by persons of another race, colour or national or ethnic origin, or enjoy a right to a more limited extent than persons of another race, colour or national or ethnic origin, then notwithstanding anything in that law, persons of the first mentioned race, colour or national or ethnic origin shall, by force of this section, enjoy that right to the same extent as persons of that other race, colour or national or ethnic origin.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, they are not my words but the words of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, which we, governed by the rule of law, are bound to take as the authority of what constitutes racial discrimination.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly section 10 of the act makes it clear that national or ethnic origin are part of the attributes which constitute racial discrimination. What these regulations do is in part construct a distinction based upon national or ethnic origin in the provisions as to whom can sponsor other people to migrate to Australia. To distinguish between a citizen and a permanent resident in this way can be argued is in breach of the Racial Discrimination Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Returning to the words of Minister Ruddock, on 30 October in the House of Representatives, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am not pleased to participate in this debate today. It is the second occasion on which I have been involved in a motion to affirm our non&hyphen;discriminatory approach to the selection of migrants in Australia, all visitors, temporary residents and others who happen to be legally in Australia with equal rights and respect regardless of their race, creed or country of origin.</PARA>
<PARA>Furthermore, the joint statement that was issued on that same day on racial tolerance in the House of Representatives stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That this House&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>point 2&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">reaffirms its commitment to maintaining an immigration policy wholly non&hyphen;discriminatory on grounds of race, colour, creed or origin.</PARA>
<PARA>All senators as well as all members, I presume, would stand by that principle and endorse it very strongly. But in view of these regulations and section 10 of the Racial Discrimination Act, it seems we a distinction between the words of the minister and the words of this government and its action in a policy form.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am glad that Minister Vanstone referred to the Migration Amendment Bill (No. 3) because, indeed, in that particular piece of legislation we see provisions designed to exempt from the Migration Act the protective provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act. How on earth can a policy, regulation or enactment be non&hyphen;discriminatory when clearly it comes into direct conflict with anti&hyphen;discrimination legislation? Clearly, it cannot. This seems to be an attempt again by this government to implement racial discrimination in Australia's immigration policy but this time <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5274"> through the Migration Amendment Bill (No. 3) and in a sexist manner, mind you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If ever there was a time when the old adage `the ends do not justify the means' was relevant, it certainly is in this debate. It is an indictment on this government that it has taken extraordinary lengths&mdash;no matter how belated&mdash;to denounce discrimination in immigration only to propose legislation and bring regulations into being which are discriminatory. The Democrats do not and will not support such a measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In regard to the introduction of points for English language&mdash;20 points in the concessional family category&mdash;to which Senator Bolkus previously referred, as I also mentioned previously, the White Australia Policy is a particularly sinister part of Australia's history. In his article `From "White Australia" to part of Asia: Recent Shifts in Australian Immigration Policy Towards the Region', James Jupp makes the following observations:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Between the 1880s and 1960s, Australia deliberately insulated itself from its geographical region by adopting the White Australia Policy. Officially known as the restrictive immigration policy, under the Commonwealth <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Immigration Restriction Act 1901</EMPHASIS>  (incidentally, one of the first acts passed by the National Parliament), the effective exclusion of non&hyphen;European immigrants formed part of a wider ideology based on fashionable theories of racial superiority. These had the greatest currency in the English&hyphen;speaking and Germanic cultures and were often supported by sophisticated "scientific" theories as much as by popular prejudice.</PARA>
<PARA>He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The mechanism for implementing the policy included a dictation test . . . It was normally given to the applicant in a language not understood by them and was not a test of literacy.</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, the imposition of a 20&hyphen;points test&mdash;that is, to the level of a native speaker&mdash;is going to have a disproportionable effect upon those people from a non&hyphen;English speaking background. Ultimately, the balance between non-English speaking backgrounds and English speaking backgrounds would significantly alter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While it may not be the intention of the minister&mdash;I do not suggest it is&mdash;to re&hyphen;create the effects of the White Australia Policy, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> clearly this would go a certain way towards that effect and therefore cannot be supported in the concessional family category. While it is true that additional points are already allocated to migrants in the skilled category, there has always been a recognition that the concessional family category should be exempt from such points testing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thought that Senator McKiernan appropriately addressed the issue of the education charge, one that the Democrats have consistently opposed. So there are no claims there by the government or the minister that we have changed our position in any way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, the Democrats are disappointed by the regulations before us today and by the apparent lack of comprehension on the part of the government as to the implementing of a non&hyphen;discriminatory policy, instead of just talking about it. Clearly, this is an area where the Democrats will be required to play a more vigilant and supervisory role, and it is not one that we intend to resile from.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister may continue to throw back at us the words in our policy and words that she may have read on our home page on the Net but I reiterate that there is no inconsistency. We are on record as not opposing a reduction in numbers but we also maintain that fundamental part of our policy to which we are committed: that any changes in migration policy or any reduction in numbers must be done in a way that is non&hyphen;discriminatory. The Democrats repudiate racism; we denounce racism; but we also celebrate multiculturalism in this country. That is also a pertinent feature of our immigration policy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The address we have heard from Senator Stott Despoja is quite interesting because, as Senator Vanstone quite correctly pointed out, the Democrats have a policy which says in essence that the number of people allowed to enter this country in the course of any given year shall not exceed the number of people leaving the country in the previous year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that the number of people leaving the country each year is about 30,000, so the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5275"> maximum number of people who should be allowed to enter the country under the Democrats policy is about 30,000. They have already said that they believe the humanitarian category should have priority. The humanitarian program was running at about 14,000 places. So that means that there is a maximum available under the Democrats' policies for all categories of about 16,000 places a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Assuming that we leave New Zealand out of it altogether, 16,000 people would mean that we would have to run an immigration program in relation to spouse entry that would be 12,000 places a year more stringent than what we are proposing under these regulations. We would have to completely eliminate the skills category and other categories. We would have to completely eliminate, for example, the preferential family reunion. We would be able to take only 16,000 spouses. There would be 12,000 spouses every year who would miss out. Nobody's brother, sister, uncle, aunt or parents would get into the country. That is the consequence of the Democrat policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet here we are making a modest move from 83,000 migrants a year to 74,000 migrants a year, and the Democrats are saying, `No. We are not going to allow you to put these regulations through the parliament because we think they are discriminatory.' Well, how discriminatory would you have to be to cut the immigration program from 83,000 people back to 30,000 people? You would have to be substantially more discriminatory than anything that could possibly be discriminatory in these regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But of course this is the Democrats, so rationality and reason do not play a big part in it. It is a little bit like `Natasha through the Looking Glass'. That is really what this is about. I was expecting the Queen of Hearts to come running down the aisle of the chamber at any moment because, if you had the Democrat immigration policy, the Queen of Hearts would have to come in here shouting, `Off with their heads!', because none of these people would be allowed in.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The argument we heard from the Democrats is that somehow these measures are racially discriminatory because in the concessional family migration program we have a points test in part on the English language. I agree with everything that my friend on the other side of the chamber has said about the evils of the White Australia Policy. However, what Senator Stott Despoja did not understand, and obviously never will, is that the White Australia Policy&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="KEMP" NAMEID="WW4">

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EU4">Senator O'CHEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are running from the logic of the argument. A prerequisite of entry under the White Australia Policy was that a person pass a dictation test. This policy states that people will get points for functional English, but it is still perfectly possible to enter this country under the concessional family reunion scheme. I am glad to see that Senator Stott Despoja is back. I acknowledge her presence in the chamber. It is always nice to have her here. It would be even nicer if the Democrats learnt something whilst they were here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a prerequisite under the White Australia Policy that a person had to pass the test. Under this policy, if you do not pass the test, you can still make it in. But concessional family reunion, which accounts for about 8,000 or 9,000 people per year, is basically an economic entry; it is a skill entry. It is not the program that applies to people who are parents or spouses. Those categories relate to a preferential family reunion. So it is incorrect to say that this discriminates against spouses or parents, because they are not in the concessional category. The concessional category is based on skills. The points that apply in the concessional category rank people in terms of their skills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the concessional category is a concession. It says that we will give people an advantage because they have a near relative who is sponsoring their entry into this country. If this category were abolished, these people would not make it under the independent points test. We are doing people a favour. At the end of the day, it is still a points tested migration category.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5276">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other category, which is the preferential category, does not have any points attached to it. It does not have a points test system. That category remains. What the Democrats say is, unfortunately, inaccurate. The concessional family reunion, because of the points test, is and always has been a skills based category. It is appropriate to apply a points test that does not disqualify people to recognise English language ability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also, if I dare say it, a little patronising of the Democrats to say that this discriminates against people from South-East Asia. I happened to go through university with some people from Singapore who spoke better English than the English students who were in the university with me. They spoke much better English. It is patronising to suggest that people who come from South-East Asia cannot speak English.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One argument we heard from Senator Bolkus on the other side of the chamber was that somehow this discriminated against people from mainland China who came here under the 1 November decision. That is incorrect. If anything, I would have thought the majority of family tests for preferential family reunion sponsorship rights advantaged people from mainland China, because the one-child policy has been in operation in mainland China for 30 years. That means that most of the people who are here under the 1 November decision are the only child in the family. In fact, Senator Bolkus is wrong; it is easier for many of these people to bring in their parents than migrants who have come from Greece, Ireland or the United Kingdom. That argument is wrong. It is disingenuous of Senator Bolkus to suggest that there was some evil, nefarious plot in the immigration policy to racially discriminate against these people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I happen to chair the coalition's back bench committee on this. I can assure honourable senators that I was assiduous, as was Senator <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Short when he was the shadow minister, in going through every measure to ensure that it did not discriminate on the basis of race. In this program, we are discriminating on the basis of what people have to offer to this country and what they will take from it. That should be the basis of the migration program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are saying about the concessional family reunion that we believe people who have English language skills are more likely to get a job. It is a fact that people who come in under the concessional family reunion program with low levels of English literacy have a much lower chance of getting a job and are much more likely to be dependent upon welfare. We are concerned about that for two reasons. The first relates to the fact that the taxpayer has to fork out money. The second relates to the fact that we do not believe it is fair to encourage people to come to this country when they have a very low chance of getting a job. It limits their right to fully participate in this nation's public life. That is why we believe these changes in relation to the English language are necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to talk about the spouse program. It is a fact that this program was in control until the 1995-96 year. In the 1995-96 year, the number of spouse applicants shot up dramatically. There was no control put over who was getting entry under the spouse program. With spouses, fiancees, de factos and interdependent relationships, it was almost open slather. Many of these marriages were sham marriages. On the limited investigations that were done during the 1995-96 financial year, 1,500 sham marriages were found in the intake, and that is just on the limited resources that were then available to the department to investigate it. The rule in the department was not to bother.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rather than being anti-family, our requirements for spouse entry are pro&hyphen;family. They are pro the legitimate marriages and anti the sham marriages. How can a person stand before an altar and take a vow of marriage before God just to get entry into this country. That is what has happened. In striking out the sham marriages and putting in requirements to show the bona fides of the marriage, we are upholding family values. Nothing can <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5277"> erode the sanctity of marriage faster than its being used as a sham to circumvent the immigration requirements of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find that, as a Christian, quite frankly, utterly, morally and religiously reprehensible. I find that a slight against my Christian values. That is why we are doing it that way, and we believe it is perfectly fair. I will give honourable senators a case study of how the system will work. I had a constituent approach me. He is well known to me. He  said, `I was best man at a wedding in the United Kingdom. It was an Australian marrying an English girl. They put an application in for spouse entry. They're concerned about whether they're going to get in.' I said, `If it's a bona fide marriage, I feel reasonably confident you'll meet the requirements. But when the spouse comes here, obviously, they have to stay married for two years.' I said, `What evidence do you have of the bona fides of the marriage?' He said, `Look, I flew over to London, a number of other people who were relatives flew over to London for the wedding. They had been engaged for some substantial period of time. They had been living together for some substantial period of time.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said, `In light of all that, I don't think you're going to have any problem because it is a bona fide marriage.' I had no hesitation in writing to the post and saying, `I happen to know some of the people who went to the wedding. They travelled all the way from Australia to the United Kingdom. These people have been together for a substantial period of time. I would like you to take my word that I believe this is a bona fide marriage.' That is all that is necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But if you happen to get married to somebody in Las Vegas, in one of those drive&hyphen;in marriage parlours, it is not unreasonable that the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs might happen to be a little bit concerned as to whether the marriage will last, even before we get to whether it is bona fide. We might happen to be concerned as to whether it will last.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not made in heaven, Senator Kemp, that is absolutely correct. Of course, we have seen a number of high profile <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people&mdash;for example, Mr Michael Jackson&mdash;undergo those marriages, and look at the consequences. All we are saying is that we are discriminating in favour of bona fide, legitimate relationships. But the program is still very, very generous.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been some suggestion from those on the other side that we should knock out some of the other parts of the regulations. For example, the motion moved by Senator Bolkus would prevent the government from recovering the full cost of English language courses from people who are essentially economic migrants. This does not apply to the family reunion categories, it does not apply to the humanitarian categories, but it will be applying to other categories where people come here on the basis of skills or because they are business migrants. If they undergo an English language course, and these people are coming here to get a financial benefit from being a resident of Australia, it is not unreasonable that we expect them to contribute a proportion of the cost. That is a perfectly reasonable proposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These people, we believe, because of the great opportunities and advantages offered by this country, will be substantially better off in economic terms after a couple of years. It is not unreasonable to expect them to pay the cost of the English language course if they are obliged to undertake an English language course. In fact, the very existence of English language courses for migrants shows that with the points test for English this system does not automatically eliminate people who do not have high levels of English language proficiency, because if the system did what Senator Bolkus said it would do, we would not be running English language courses in the first place. So yet another perfectly reasonable proposal put forward by the government has been knocked back.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition seeks also to prevent the government from recouping benefits received by migrants within the first two years that they are in this country. We have said that people who are arriving as migrants from now on cannot expect to receive social security. We have said that where people are sponsored there should be a bond. The opposition wants <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5278"> us to stop any opportunity to recover from that bond where the people who have been brought in and sponsored receive social security benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the point of putting up the bond? What is the point of asking people to be sponsors? Anybody can put their hand up and say, `I'm going to sponsor Joe Bloggs to come into this country. Yes, I will make sure he meets all his requirements. Yes, I understand he can't get welfare.' Of course, Joe Bloggs comes in, he does not bother to do anything, Joe Bloggs finds himself down on his heels. We do the humanitarian thing and give him some money, but the sponsor does not have any obligation at all, under what the opposition is proposing, to ensure that the sponsor actually meets their obligations. That, we believe, is wrong. It is wrong for this country, it is also morally wrong, because these people give a promise and it is not unreasonable to expect that that promise should be backed up with some form of surety. In fact, the opposition have even said in some of their statements that they accept that. Unfortunately, here they are in the Senate chamber, they have said they accept it and now they want to knock out the regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can see, Mr Acting Deputy President, that what we have here are some fairly shallow arguments from those on the other side. One of the things that really gets me is that they say they are concerned about family reunion. Senator Bolkus talked about family reunion. What we are proposing in these regulations is that people who are here under the humanitarian program can be allowed to bring in their immediate families. That regulation would be knocked out by the motion that Senator Bolkus has moved today. That regulation would be knocked out if Senator Bolkus's motion gets up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the knock&hyphen;out blow should not be delivered to the regulations, should not be delivered to the integrity of the migration program; I believe the knock&hyphen;out blow should be delivered to this motion. I believe the Senate should knock this motion out and allow the government to continue a migration program that is reasonable, balanced and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> basically reflects what the migration program was in 1994&hyphen;95, before it blew out in the 1995&hyphen;96 financial year. That is all we are seeking to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But if we do not have it, it stands to the shame of those opposite that we have been prevented from doing so. The Democrats say they believe that net migration should be zero. They would only allow 30,000 people into the country. We are saying we are going to take it down from 83,000 to 74,000. They are saying, `No, we're not going to let you do it because we think that would be discriminatory.' People on the other side are making all sorts of outrageous claims, none of which stand up to scrutiny. This is being done for the basest of political motives, and that is why it should be rejected by the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

It is pretty much a utilitarian, economic, fundamentalist viewpoint. It says, in effect, that the door is open but not if it is a matter of the heart, not if it is a matter of humanitarianism, not if it is a matter of concern for the plight a person might be in when she or he wants to come to this country.

I also heard Senator O'Chee say that it is patronising to suggest that people from South&hyphen;East Asia cannot speak English. What an extraordinary statement! That comment was made apparently on the basis of the case of some friends from Singapore that he knew at university. That does not suggest that he has travelled very widely because the reality is that most people in South&hyphen;East Asia do not speak English.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5279">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to take into account that it is a reality that most people in the world do not speak English and that we need to open our eyes to the fact that most people wanting to come to this country from South&hyphen;East Asia, for whatever reason, will not be able to speak English&mdash;certainly at a level which is better than the average English&hyphen;speaking student in a university in Australia, as Senator O'Chee would maintain. He also said, at the outset, that the Democrats' policy was one of nobody's parents, nobody's sister and nobody's brother getting into the country. But what he is saying is that somebody's parents, somebody's sister and somebody's brother are not going to get into the country&mdash;who previously would have&mdash;if these regulations were to be disallowed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem is: how are you going to select that somebody? Which somebody's sister, which somebody's parents or which somebody's brother will be blocked from coming here because of the regulations the government has before the Senate? That is another reason why we should consider very carefully allowing those regulations to go past this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I am not going to recount the arguments put by Senator Bolkus and the other speakers who are supporting the disallowance of the regulations, except to say that they will have my vote. It is perhaps summed up by the Ethnic Communities' Council of New South Wales. I quote briefly from a letter written by Angela Chan, the chairperson of that council which represents over a thousand, affiliated, ethnic organisations and members:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ECC of NSW believes that many of the proposed changes will have a discriminatory effect including:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The requirement of citizenship to sponsor immediate family, including spouses.</PARA>
<PARA>What they mean there is that if you are a permanent resident, you are not going to be able to sponsor immediate family; you will need to be a citizen. That is a change from the past. Next:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The changes in the pass marks required for the Concessional family category, giving considerable advantage to people of English&hyphen;speaking background.  <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>That is a levying of increased discrimination against those people who do not have an English&hyphen;speaking background. As Senator Bolkus so succinctly put it, it means that, if you are on one side of the street where the family speaks English, you will be able to get family members through the requirements and into the country on the basis of family reunion; whereas if you are across the other side of the street in Australia where the family does not have family members speaking fluent English, or English as a first language, those people will not be able to. That is where this difference will be levied. It is discriminatory, not only against people wanting to come into the country but also against families already living in this country. It is discriminatory against Australian citizens and Australian permanent residents. Next:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The huge increase in fees for visa applications and English Language Tuition.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The requirement of parents to have a majority of their children in Australia before being able to migrate.</PARA>
<PARA>Previously, the `majority' terminology was not required but now, if you have only two children, both must be in Australia. It is not good enough to have one child in Australia or, to put it conversely as Senator Stott Despoja did, if you are a child in Australia and you want to have your parents given the opportunity to come into this country and you have a sibling somewhere else in the world, you will need to get that sister or brother to come here before you have a chance of being able to get your parents to join you. That is a change against such people coming to live in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The council says the new regulations will also be discriminatory because they are:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Requiring assurances of support be provided for spouses and other family reunion categories.</PARA>
<PARA>And because of:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The real reduction in the Humanitarian intake.</PARA>
<PARA>Ms Chan continues:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to participate in this debate on Senator Bolkus's motion to disallow the migration regulations because it is a very important matter. It boils down to whether we agree with the proposition that the government of this nation has the right and the ability to determine who can enter Australia. If the disallowance motion were to be successful today, it would be a death blow to the ability of the elected government of the day to determine Australia's migration program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Throughout our history, the major parties&mdash;the coalition parties and the Labor Party&mdash;were absolutely at one on the fundamental proposition that the government of the day had, as one of its basic rights and responsibilities, the determination of who can enter this country within the bounds of, as we have had for a long time now, a totally non&hyphen;discriminatory policy. The policy of successive governments has been non&hyphen;discriminatory in respect of race, ethnicity, nationality, colour, creed or religion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my opening remarks I want to stress very strongly that the Howard government is completely committed to a totally non&hyphen;discriminatory policy, as the coalition parties have been since, as I am very proud to say, the coalition government of Harold Holt in 1966 abolished the White Australia Policy, which was discriminatory and abhorrent. But since those days, for the last 30 years, virtually without exception&mdash;there have been some <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> hiccoughs from time to time, particularly so far as the Labor Party is concerned&mdash;all major parties in Australia have followed a totally non&hyphen;discriminatory approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But that approach must be seen within the context of the government of the day being able to determine the size and composition of its migration program from between the different categories of family reunion, skilled migration, humanitarian refugee intake, and the like. I do not know of anyone, with the possible exception of some of the speakers today&mdash;Senator Bob Brown in particular&mdash;who would differ from that view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The disallowance motion that we are discussing is unprecedented because, as I understand it, it is the first time that a government's migration policy arrangements, since being put into legislative form, have been the subject of a sustained and constant attack by an opposition. As I said, if this motion were successful, it would be the first time in Australian history that an elected government has not been allowed to do its required job of managing the Australian migration program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I strongly put to those supporting the disallowance motion&mdash;particularly to Senator Harradine and Senator Colston, very honourable senators who have at the core of their approach to the parliamentary system the understanding that the elected government of the day must be able to govern&mdash;that this disallowance motion, if it were to be passed, would negate the fundamental rights and responsibilities of an elected government in a parliamentary democracy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The great irony of all this is that the opposition is seeking to remove measures which we have introduced because of the previous Labor government's mismanagement of the migration program. The prime architect of that mismanagement was none other than Senator Bolkus, who has the hypocrisy to come into the chamber today and move this disallowance motion. Senator Bolkus speaks very much with a forked tongue in this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the one hand, the opposition claims that it agrees with the overall size of the program for 1996&hyphen;97, yet the disallowance motion <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5281"> seeks to destroy the very measures required to achieve that size of program. I would have thought that there was general agreement amongst members of this parliament and in the wider community that the migration program is out of control. And it is out of control because of Senator Bolkus's gross mismanagement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The critical concern I have&mdash;as a person who throughout my whole life has continued to support a strong immigration program as a fundamental requirement of the sort of Australia that I want to see develop in the future&mdash;is that the mismanagement of the program and the previous government's allowing it to get out of balance has destroyed community confidence in migration in a way that is extremely damaging. No government will be able to pursue a vibrant, progressive, strong migration policy in the future if it does not have community support for that program.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just a moment. You have had your go. It just helps maintain the publicity she receives. I do not want to prolong that publicity, but I do want to use this debate to put on the public record some of my views on this situation. I will do it very briefly. Unlike your view, Senator Collins, it is my view that, during most of my lifetime, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a high level of immigration was accepted as almost an article of faith. That view has been questioned increasingly in more recent years. The impact of migration on the economy, and particularly employment and unemployment levels, has attracted increased consideration. It is important and desirable that there be a lively debate on these matters and, particularly, on our immigration program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The impact of migration on population distribution, resource usage, international relations, the environment and the nature of our society also has come to be increasingly debated and requires careful debate. Those necessary and desirable debates, though, must be based on facts, on sophisticated analysis, on the Australia we have today and on a realistic assessment of our future, rather than on any nostalgic view perhaps of an Australia of the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the duty of each and every one of us, individually and collectively, to continue to work towards still greater tolerance and harmony, and cultural and economic vibrancy, in Australia. It is our duty to be ever vigilant against those in our ranks whose words or actions cause division within our society and who, through ignorance or for whatever other motives, conscious or unconscious, fan the flames of bigotry or hatred, whether these be on racial or any other grounds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is for that reason that the contribution of people like the member for Oxley, Ms Hanson, is to me both repugnant and dangerous. Her approach is based on ignorance. It is remarkably simplistic. It is based on incorrect facts and unsubstantiated assertions. It is confused and inconsistent. Ms Hanson appears unwilling to accept that future migrants could provide net benefits to Australia. She damns with faint praise the enormous benefits that migrants have brought to Australia throughout our history, especially over the past 50 years of virtually uninterrupted large-scale migration from all corners of the globe. Hers is a negative, destructive approach which simply does not reflect the Australia of today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come back to the point that the views of people like that have been encouraged by the undermining of confidence in the migration program that we have had under the previous <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5282"> government. That is precisely what the government is attempting to do in its&mdash;</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The program that the government is seeking to implement is a balanced program both in size and composition. To those who say that it is a major attempt to slash or to ignore the virtues of family reunion, I would simply have to say that the figures do not support that. It is true that there will be a reduction in family reunion this year compared with last year. But last year saw a very large increase in family reunion and a major decrease&mdash;and that has been occurring over years&mdash;in the proportion of people in other categories.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come to a point that was made by several speakers in relation to the 1989 comment of Philip Ruddock, the now Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and then shadow minister, that to cap the number of spouses would be&mdash;I think he used the word&mdash;`unconscionable'. There are two or three very important things that need to be said about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first point I want to make is that Labor itself proposed to cap the number of spouses in 1989. Now they have changed their mind and they are saying that there should not be any capping. Now there is, of course, even more need to properly manage the program. Capping in this area is one important&mdash;and as fair as can be determined&mdash;way of doing so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point I would make in relation to Philip Ruddock's comments in 1989, compared with the situation today, is that there has been an enormous change in the balance of the migration program between that time and now. For example, in 1988-89, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 46,000 out of a total migration intake of 124,000 constituted family reunion. That was something of the order of a third. In the year just concluded, 1995-96, out of a total intake of 82,000, 48,000 were family reunion. That is almost 60 per cent&mdash;not far short of two-thirds&mdash;almost a doubling of the proportion. So the situation is very different indeed now from then.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, of course, there is now substantial evidence of fraud in the program. I am amazed and I regret to see that Senator Bolkus today virtually ignored the significance of that. That fraud is a matter of great concern to a huge range of Australians, including potential immigrants to Australia who want to come in for fair, proper and honest reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are some of the things I wanted to give the lie to in terms of this debate today. Senator McKiernan made the point that when I was the shadow minister for immigration I said during election period and prior to that that English is the glue that binds the nation together. I do not resile from that statement and nor does the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two points have been made today about the English requirement. The first relates to the increase in fees for English language training. I stress that it is only an increase in fees for those who already make a contribution. We are increasing the degree of cost recovery in those categories where people already make a contribution towards the cost of their training. The opposition would have us believe that everyone is going to be slugged a fortune to learn English. The fact is that refugee, humanitarian and preferential family visa holders will remain exempt from this charge. There will be no charge to learn English for preferential family newcomers or refugee or humanitarian entrants. They are the ones whose needs are the greatest and they are the ones who will continue to be totally protected. There will be no charge for their English language tuition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point made by Senator McKiernan and others is that the government is going to put a points score for English in the concessional family category. The maximum will be 20 out of a total possible score <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5283"> of 150. A person who is well skilled and has no English at all will still be able to enter Australia in that concessional family category.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The way this issue has been presented&mdash;and this happened time and again during the election; this is an election undertaking that we are now introducing; it is not new because we announced it before the election and there were great debates about it around the country and I participated in virtually all of them&mdash;is that if you have not got any English you will not get in through the concessional family category. That is simply untrue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point that is ignored is that if a person who does not speak English but is fluent in two other languages applies under the concessional family category they get bonus points. They will get five bonus points. That might help them get over the points hurdle for entry into Australia. I want to dispel completely the absolute untruth that has been peddled for months that, so far as the concessional family category is concerned, if you cannot speak English, in the future you will not get into Australia. That is not true.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Migrants now are not accepted for a range of occupations on the occupational listing, which was introduced by the previous government and has been in existence for years, unless they are proficient in English. It is absolutely mandatory that they are proficient in English before they will be allowed into the country to undertake occupations in certain of the categories. For Labor to be saying that the new government is introducing something which is fundamentally different from anything that ever existed in the past is simply untrue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One can make similar points about most of the other issues that have been raised today. I think those issues have been covered very fully and amply by the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Senator Vanstone, and my colleague Senator O'Chee. I do not want go into all of those again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to pick up the point about assurances of support and the bonding requirements that are part of the regulations. Assurances of support have existed in the migration policies of successive governments. I am not sure, but <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> I think the current assurances of support arrangements were probably introduced by the previous Labor government and they had our support. The simple fact is that they have not been working and they need strengthening. That is what the regulations, which the opposition seeks to disallow, include in part.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question of Australian citizens versus Australian  residents, so far as sponsorship is concerned, is an important issue. It is a new point. It constitutes a departure from previous practice whereby Australian residents, whether they were citizens or not, have been able to sponsor people in the family category. People can have different views on that. I would have thought that most Australians would say that this is a time when there is a need for a rational approach and as fair and objective an approach to both the size and the category composition of our migration program as possible. We hear a lot of crocodile tears from the opposition and others about the impact of migration on employment and unemployment levels. That has not been proven. I think that requires further careful debate and consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You cannot make the point that migration increases unemployment and, at the same time, say that we cannot have some decent, proper, and as fair and objective as possible, rationing system. I think most Australians would say that an Australian citizen should have preference over an Australian non&hyphen;citizen in being able to sponsor persons to come to live in this country. People have different views on that, but the simple fact is that, if you are not to use that sort of screening or rationing mechanism, you will have to use other mechanisms which may well be much less fair to all concerned. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final point of detail that I wanted to pick up was to refute the assertion that in some respects the regulations are retrospective. That simply is not correct. Senator Bolkus, in a press release issued on 29 October, stated that `in attempting to make some of the changes retrospective, the government has made legally flawed regulations'. On behalf of the government, I say to Senator Bolkus that that is not so. The amendments to the regulations are fully prospective in nature, in that the regulation <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5284"> amendments apply only to decisions made after the commencement of the regulations on 1 October 1996. Any argument that the regulations are retrospective is simply wrong as a matter of law. Legislation operates retrospectively only if it provides that rights and obligations are changed with effect prior to the commencement of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although the amendments may affect some applications on hand at the date of commencement of the regulations on 1 October 1996, they do not affect the rights or obligations of those applicants prior to this date. I understand that that matter has been the subject of advice from the Attorney-General's Department, which has confirmed fully the legality of these regulation amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by making a plea to Senator Harradine and Senator Colston to look very carefully at this disallowance motion moved by Senator Bolkus on behalf of the opposition. If this disallowance motion is passed, what the Senate is really saying is that the elected government of this country does not have the right or the responsibility to determine the level and content of its immigration program. That is something that really is unprecedented in the history of this nation, and I believe that would be seen as a matter of very great concern by each and every Australian.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a very important matter indeed that has come before the parliament. I acknowledge what Senator Short said; that is, that over a period of years there has been a bipartisan approach to the question, and that by and large migration regulations have received that bipartisan support. Mind you&mdash;and I remind the Senate of this&mdash;that was not so in respect of Mig 2 and Mig 4, which were those put forward by the then minister, Senator Bolkus. They had a run around the legal and constitutional committee. I thought I would mention that, because it is not the first time that regulations have been challenged. But Senator Short is correct: largely, these matters have been matters of bipartisan support and have gone through this place without having been disallowed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to advert to something that Senator O'Chee said about the issue of sham marriages for the purpose of persons trying to get into this country. Of course, we all condemn that. We all would want to tighten the situation that enables that to occur. I have made it perfectly clear to the government that I support that. As I understand it, the opposition has no objection to the introduction of the provisional two&hyphen;year visa. But the trouble is, as is often the case with these regulations, that that desirable objective is so intertwined with other provisions&mdash;in this case, the provisions relating to citizenship and the provisions relating to Australian residents&mdash;that it cannot be extracted. But I give the government my assurance that I would support it strongly in bringing that matter forward if it can be done in such a way that it is clear and not mixed up and inextricably interwoven with other provisions which clearly are not acceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do appreciate very much the time that has been given to us by the department and its officers and by the minister on this matter. I have been well advised on this matter. I have been given all of the information, and I have considered it very thoroughly. There have been, as the officers know, hours and hours spent on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government says quite openly that the regulations seek to limit the right of persons who are lawfully and permanently resident within the Commonwealth to have live with them their spouses, their children and their parents. The government has made it clear that its intention is to reduce the migrant intake, and this is a measure which it sees as being an equitable way of achieving that objective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I point out to the Senate, as I think has already been done, although I have not heard it, that it is the family area that is going to take the brunt of the reduction. I do note what Senator Short said. Yes, there was an increase in family intakes last year&mdash;in fact, there has been a reasonably substantial increase over the last three years&mdash;but I will come to that in a moment. In this particular instance, it means that the preferential family category will drop from 50,500 in 1995-96 to the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5285"> planned level of 36,700. That is a 14,000 drop.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I acknowledge what you said about that, Senator Short. I admit that, of all the people in this chamber, you would probably be the one who has had a very detailed knowledge of these matters over a long period of time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me just say that the intake for the other category&mdash;the total skilled program&mdash;is going up by roughly 5,000. So the brunt of this proposal is falling on the family category. It is my strong held view, as I have expressed time and time again, that anyone lawfully resident in this country has the right to have their family with them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bonds of marriage and family are the foundations of any civilised society. In saying this, I acknowledge, too, that that view is generally held right throughout this parliament and particularly by the last speaker, Senator Short. I feel that to do what this measure is going to do&mdash;that is, to keep husbands and wives and parents and children separated&mdash;is not appropriate. It is certainly not appropriate for a civilised country which acknowledges that marriage and family are the basic foundation of a civil society. When we look at less fortunate countries and tyrannies, what always moves us to compassion is seeing the break up of families and the separation of people from those whom they love.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also wish to make a comment about the history of this. Quick and Garran, in their classic <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Annotated Constitution of the Australian Commonwealth</EMPHASIS>, pointed out on pages 954 and 959 that the founding fathers of this federation expressly denied the Commonwealth power to legislate over citizenship. They feared that to give the Commonwealth power over citizenship was to give it power to make somebody a non-citizen. Only three categories of persons are recognised in the constitution&mdash;subjects of the Queen, people of the Commonwealth and people of the state. The High Court has made certain interpretations since then, and we all know that. But the basic principle which should guide us, I believe, is liberality.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Persons who are lawfully in this country and who are subjected to the same taxes and same obligations as the rest of us should be treated no less favourably when it comes to such fundamental questions as the right to have their families reside with them. Senator Short did say there are various views about that matter. Of course there are various views about it&mdash;there are something like 900,000 voters on the electoral role who are non-citizens. Take the British migrants for a start; those people who have not bothered taking out citizenship. Senator McKiernan, are you a non-citizen?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, some of them are Irish as well. I have a number of cases that relate to this, and I am not going to delay the Senate by raising them all. One specific example from South Australia is a classic. The application of regulation 1.05&mdash;the balance of family test&mdash;will mean that the people in this example who wanted to get their parents out from the United Kingdom will be unable to do so. The parents were going to make an application two years ago, but the wife of their son contracted cancer and ultimately died this year. When they went to get an application to come out here, they were told, `Well, it's no good now because of the effect of the new regulation.' That new regulation says:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>That is ludicrous. For crying out loud! At the moment, it is 50 per cent. They have said <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5286"> `greater than 50 per cent'. I suppose that favours parents with one, three, five or seven children and does not favour those with two, four, six or eight. In any event, you could have a family of six children, with three in Australia, one in the United Kingdom, one in the United States and one in Europe, and you cannot bring the parents out even though all the grandchildren are here&mdash;as in this case&mdash;because they have not got more than 50 per cent of their children resident in Australia. That is ludicrous. I thought perhaps we could dolly up some taxation&hyphen;type amendment that would deem a notional children percentage here or there so as to get these people in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been given the wind&hyphen;up. I will not go into the details. The government says it wants to increase the intake of skilled migrants and lower family intake to justify the immigration program to the Australian people. I say very simply&mdash;and I make no bones about it&mdash;that there ought to be more migrants. I do not think that there should be a cut in the migration program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe migrants are being unfairly made the scapegoats for unemployment in this country. I think governments have to have a look at this question of unemployment, as I have said time and time again, and the previous government too is at fault. You really do have to know what unemployment is. Simply stated, unemployment arises because there are more people in or seeking paid work than there are jobs available at the same time as there is downsizing&mdash;a euphemism&mdash;and cutting of jobs because of technological change and so on. Under those circumstances, you really have to have a look at the participation rate and giving a true freedom of choice to those persons who are in paid work who have better reasons to be out of it so that they can engage in more socially constructive alternatives. I hope the government will ultimately see that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I want to say that if we want to engender support for migration to this country, surely the best way to do this is within the family reunion area. It stands to reason. I think the balance that is being proposed by these regulations, which is against family reunions, is not the best way of going about <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that even though, as Senator Short emphasised, there was that substantial increase last year and the year before.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate the opportunity to indicate that the opposition will be supporting the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996. It is always a pleasant contribution to make when I can say that all the measures contained within the bill will be supported by the opposition, which is something that I must say is not a comment I can make on other social security legislation that is before the parliament at this stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The opposition, for its part, has facilitated the passage of this non&hyphen;controversial legisla tion, and I make the point to the Senate that the opposition supports the four key elements of the bill because in the main this bill is about correcting technical errors and oversights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are four key elements that I will touch on in my brief second reading contribution. Firstly, the bill exempts payments from the Mark Fitzpatrick Trust for people with medically acquired HIV or AIDS; it exempts them from the assets test. I note that these payments are already exempt from the income test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill continues the effect of savings provisions which allow women to be automatically transferred from mature age partner allowance to wife pension when their partner, who was granted mature age allowance before 1 July 1996, is automatically transferred from mature age allowance to age pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also continues the effect of savings provisions from a previous measure by replacing references to additional family payment according to the current family payment arrangements. It also corrects an error in the pension rate calculator so that, as is current practice, the income of a person's pension partner can be taken into account under the pensions income test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I indicated, in the view of the opposition, this bill is non&hyphen;controversial and, fundamentally, it is about correcting technical flaws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure the Minister for Social Security</PARA>
<PARA>(Senator Newman) would be aware&mdash;and Senator Tambling as the responsible parliamentary secretary&mdash;that the opposition did have some concerns about the beneficiaries of the Mark Fitzpatrick Trust finding out about the concession that is provided to them through this legislation. This is something that the Senate Standing Committee on the Scrutiny of Bills also raised and the committee's concerns are able to be looked at by all honourable senators in its <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Alert Digest</EMPHASIS>  of 16 August this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased that subsequently the minister's office has confirmed that trust beneficiaries who have applied for a review of their payment have been paid the adjusted <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5288"> rate of payment in anticipation of this bill being passed. I also understand that, on the request of the opposition, the minister has written to the chair of the Mark Fitzpatrick Trust asking that beneficiaries of the trust be alerted to their rights to ask for a review of their payment and their entitlement to arrears, if any arrears do arise, from the date that they ask for a review. The opposition is satisfied in this case that the minister has done what she is able to do to inform people of the benefits that flow to them as a result of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not intend to take up more time of the chamber speaking in support of the Social Security Legislation Bill (No. 1) except to say, as I think I mentioned in commencing my remarks on this particular matter, it is nice to see that the government at least got this one right on social security. Of course, other matters of social security legislation before us are a different thing altogether. But this bill is supported by the opposition and I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate and I thank the opposition for their generous support for these initiatives outlined in the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996. As Senator Faulkner indicated, the number of issues canvassed by the opposition have been addressed. I know that the Minister for Social Security, Senator Newman, has at all times been keen to cooperate with interested senators in this regard. I am also pleased to acknowledge that a number of these initiatives were initially canvassed by the former government. It is a matter that the current government has been able to pick up and implement as a matter of course and of procedure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Faulkner referred to the fact that the bill provided four important aspects: the issue surrounding the Mark Fitzpatrick Trust; the mature age partner allowance; certain technical matters relating to savings provisions; and amendments relating to the pension rate calculator.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is important and, unlike Senator Faulkner, I would trust that the Senate would <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have particular regard to other social security initiatives that the government will take the opportunity to present to the parliament in the near future. I would not be as cynical as Senator Faulkner, who perhaps indicated that there were threats of a lack of support. I would hope that the arguments relating to social security issues to be canvassed and addressed in the parliament in the coming months will enjoy, as they should, full and wide support from all parties, members and senators.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This legislation and the related amendments concern the sale of Commonwealth Funds Management and the possible sale, as I understand it, depending on the tender outcome, of Total Risk Management Pty Ltd. Commonwealth management has approximately 120 employees and TRM has approximately 20 employees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is important to emphasise that what is being sold here is the management fund itself and not the assets of Commonwealth Funds Management that are managed by Commonwealth Funds Management. The funds that are under management&mdash;I understand it is $7.5 billion&mdash;continue to remain under the ownership of the trustees of the PSS, the CSS and a number of other superannuation fund trustees. I think it is very important to emphasise that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, the asset valuation of the company itself, Total Risk Management and Commonwealth Funds Management, is about $19 million and that is made up on paper of office fittings. I am not sure whether that includes a building. But it is important to emphasise that particular point. With the sale of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5289"> Commonwealth Funds Management, and the possible sale of Total Risk Management, the company that successfully tenders to buy will take over the management of the fund's $7.5 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to emphasise that whichever company is successful in winning the contract it does not have that $7.5 billion locked in for any period at all. The trustees, who legally own the moneys, have the right, from the date of the sale, to move the moneys in whatever way suits them, from the successful tenderer to any other private sector funds manager that they see fit. That is in contrast to the sale of the funds management arm of the public sector in New South Wales. I will make another comment on that shortly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In looking at this particular issue, it is important to understand that, in this country, superannuation moneys are owned by trustees on behalf of the members in the fund. They are owned by the trustees and they are managed by the trustees; and generally&mdash;overwhelmingly&mdash;trustees subcontract the management of the funds to a large number of private sector funds management companies. In this country, I understand, some 96 or 97 per cent of moneys are managed by private sector funds management companies. With the sale of CFM, a government owned funds manager, to a private sector company, it is not a case of the government funds manager in any sense being able to influence the private sector funds management moneys in this country. The overwhelming majority of moneys are managed by private funds management companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor government created Commonwealth Funds Management in 1990 out of the old superannuation fund operations. Regrettably, the record of CFM&mdash;and this is a second major factor in our supporting the sale of CFM&mdash;could best be described as poor. It ranks 24th out of 28 in the pool of 28 other managed funds in this country. Looking at the average return of CFM in 1994, 1995 and 1996, its return fell below the market average of managed growth funds in each of those three years. Its average return was six per cent over those three years, compared with the market average of 7.3 per cent. Of course, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a significant number of funds management companies did much better than 7.3 per cent. Looking at the Intech superannuation performance survey, CFM was ranked 32nd out of 37 superannuation funds in the 12 months to 31 March 1996. CFM's return of 7.2 per cent for that period stands in contrast to that for the first ranked company, ANZ, of 14.2 per cent. That is the second factor in our supporting the sale of CFM.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, the union itself&mdash;the CPSU&mdash;which was originally opposed to the sale of CFM now holds a position of support for the sale of CFM. It does so for a range of reasons, not least of which are the transitional provisions for the continuity of wages, conditions of employment and&mdash;in respect of superannuation&mdash;entitlements of employees. It also believes that the carry&hyphen;over of redundancy provisions stands as a model in the event of any privatisation. For a variety of other reasons, including the lower general return that CFM has experienced over the past three years, the CPSU is not opposed to the sale of CFM.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other important consideration in supporting the sale of CFM is that there is no possible risk to members' money under management. There is no risk, because the public sector superannuation funds for the vast majority of members are defined benefit funds. Whether an individual who leaves the public sector chooses to take a lump sum or an annuity, the government has guaranteed an outcome because it is a defined benefit fund. If the return of the moneys is not sufficient to meet the amount required for an individual who is leaving the public sector funds, the government has, because the fund is a defined benefit fund, an obligation to meet any particular shortfall. In fact, in this case, given the poorer general returns of CFM, in the longer term the government will save money, as long as whoever purchases CFM is able to obtain a better investment return than CFM has done over the last three years. The government will in fact save money because it is not required to top up whatever the shortfall may be on the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5290"> Another factor is that CFM is experiencing a critical problem in maintaining its profes sional expertise, its professional employees. Over the last few months, I, along with a number of other members of caucus, and my staff have met with CFM management and also with the CPSU. We have had discussions with the Minister for Finance, Mr Fahey. For the reasons that I have outlined, we are prepared to support the sale of CFM. I know that the reasons I have outlined in support of the sale of CFM stand in stark contrast to those given for the proposed sale of Telstra. We do not believe that they fit into the same category. We do not believe that the sale of CFM even fits into the same category as the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. I do not intend to canvass the issues in respect of the Commonwealth Bank or Telstra, but we believe that they are distinctly different reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The case for CFM no longer remaining in public ownership is overwhelming, in our view. It is not just for the public good, and it is not just for the good of the budget: it is overwhelmingly in the best interests of the members of the various public sector superannuation funds that have their moneys managed by CFM. In consultation with the CPSU on this matter, the complaints that the CPSU has received about CFM have gone to the generally poor return of CFM, and not to the proposed sale of CFM. We accept that the arguments for the sale of CFM are overwhelming. We approach the issue of privatisation on a case by case basis. We do not have any particular ideological disposition to privatisation. As I say, we adopt&mdash;for very good reasons&mdash;a different approach to Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The only other point, and I will conclude on it, is a word of warning to the government. In considering this matter, Labor also considered the matter of the administrative section that is responsible for the record&hyphen;keeping of public sector workers' superannuation entitlements. I do not know how many employees are involved in that area. They are part of the general Public Service. With the sale of CFM, in respect of this bill, there is no proposal to privatise the administrative section of the work force of the public sector that are involved in the record&hyphen;keeping and the processing, et cetera, of the superannua tion records. I would say for the record that, if we are ever presented with such a proposal, we will oppose it. We see the administrative record&hyphen;keeping of superannuation entitlements of public sector workers as a proper and legitimate public sector function that should continue in direct public sector ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only other comment I will make is that the New South Wales government is privatising both its funds management arm and the administrative arm, which actually administers the public sector superannuation entitlements of New South Wales public servants. The New South Wales government is providing a guarantee that whoever is the successful tenderer for the funds management arm in New South Wales will receive those funds for, I believe, four years. That is not the case with the sale that we are considering today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no guarantee that the funds will continue to be placed with whoever the successful tenderer is. The only way the successful tenderer can maintain those funds under management is by its better return. If it does not achieve a better return then I have no doubt that the trustees of these moneys will&mdash;as I would argue that they have an obligation to&mdash;remove those moneys and place them elsewhere to obtain the better return. For those reasons, we support the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendments 1, 2 and 3 go to ensuring the continuity of entitlements of the employees of CFM with respect to long service leave. Obviously, we support that.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak briefly on this bill which allows the sale of Commonwealth Funds Management. I opposed the claim of urgency in respect of this bill a few days ago. The reason I did so goes to the heart of legislative process and the process of sale of public assets.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5291"> The argument for urgency presented to the Senate was essentially that the employees and buyers of CFM might be disadvantaged and made less secure if the sale was not decided on immediately. I rejected this as an argument for urgency because, if it is accepted, all a government needs to do to create an exception to the cut&hyphen;off in the Senate is to an nounce and start the process of sale, and so create uncertainty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But such an announcement&mdash;and, effectively, beginning the process of sale prior to approval of parliament&mdash;is an affront to the role of parliament and democratic process. In so anticipating and undermining the role of parliament, government acts without authority. For this reason, there is no urgency, can be no urgency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prior to a decision to sell a public asset, there should be no moves to sell it, and so no substantial insecurity. Where a government wants to sell an asset, the correct procedure is to go to parliament, get a decision, and only then announce a decision and initiate a process of sale. The process should be made clear to potential buyers. CFM is currently not on the market and may never be. Parliament has not yet decided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that, in the push to privatise anything and everything the public own or do, government subverted this process with CFM. The CPSU is the union representing the workers whose money is in the Commonwealth fund as well as those who operate CFM. At this point, the process is so far advanced that the CPSU, which initially opposed the sale, believes that, if the sale is not finalised soon, it will have the potential for adverse impacts on its members. But they are clear that this is because the process was begun in spite of the absence of the authority of parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to the sale itself, for most people in the Public Service who are fund members the trustee system works reasonably well to give them a voice, and will continue to give them a voice. In many respects, things will not change. The main issue is that now there is a private sector fund owner that will want to make a profit. The option of the Commonwealth making a profit or deciding to transfer all profits to members will, effectively, disappear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also raises the issue of the compulsory nature of some superannuation schemes, including the Commonwealth superannuation fund. We are selling the right to profit from public sector workers who are required to join this fund. In effect, as we have noted before, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> while we do not concede urgency, we do consider this now to be a non&hyphen;controversial bill. We do not like the sale, and oppose it, but understand that it will pass and that, in this case, it is a good thing for it to pass quickly. The one thing I would like to ensure is that the process of sale is open and proper and can be scrutinised by the public and by parliament.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the opposition for their support of the CFM Sale Bill and note the comments of Senator Margetts. May I say, in relation to Senator Sherry, that I am pleased to hear the opposition say that it will approach privatisation on a case&hyphen;by&hyphen;case basis. I think that is appropriate. That is the way the government approaches privatisations. It just surprises me that the question of Telstra does not fit within the Australian Labor Party's framework for privatisation, given that we are disposing of only one&hyphen;third of it and that the Commonwealth will, of course, retain control of that particular entity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note Senator Margetts's comments. It was certainly the practice of the previous government, and I think it is the practice of most governments around the world, to announce their proposals and policy in relation to the sale of government assets and then to seek parliamentary approval of them. I think we are pursuing a normal practice in relation to this particular matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to CFM itself, this sale is a natural progression from earlier decisions to establish CFM as a funds management company and to end its legislative monopoly. These decisions led to a fundamental change in CFM's role. For example, CFM is no longer the sole funds manager for the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme and the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme. CFM's legislative monopoly over the management of the CSS and PSS funds ended on 30 June 1995, under the previous government. CFM's role now extends beyond the management of the superannuation funds of Commonwealth public servants. It has a number of other clients in both the public and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5292"> the private sectors for which it undertakes wholesale funds management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is also important for the government to note, for the Senate's benefit, that CFM's functions, from our point of view, are not part of the government's core activities. As the report of the National Commission of Audit indicated, the government business enterprises, whose objectives are to provide goods and services on a commercial basis, should be retained in public ownership only if there is a clear public interest case for doing so. That audit report considered that in a market based economy, which ours clearly is, controlled by a democratically elected government, there are only two primary reasons for government involvement in business: social equity, where the market system is incapable of delivering the social outcomes that the elected government has been given a mandate to achieve; and market failure, which is often associated with monopoly or undue influence through market power. Neither of these reasons is applicable to CFM. The government does not need to have its own funds manager.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's decision to sell CFM is, therefore, consistent with the changing role of CFM and the recommendations of the audit commission. The government also considers that the decision will be in the interests of the longer&hyphen;term future of CFM. In reaching its decision, the government consulted with the board of CFM, which has fully supported the initiative and which is being closely consulted during the sale process. The sale process is also being undertaken in close consultation with CFM's major clients, particularly the CSS and PSS boards, to enable them to look after the interests of their members. I therefore commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking on the appropriations bills today I want to look specifically at the impact of the first coalition budget on women and their families. It is a subject that I feel has not received much attention, especially in the media, and it is particularly relevant to work that has been going on now for many years. So I want to give a very brief history lesson on what has happened in previous years with budgetary planning to ensure that 54 per cent of the population is fully considered in the process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1984 the then Labor government introduced Australia's first women's budget. In that budget it announced 20,000 extra child&hyphen;care places, new work opportunities for female apprentices, and the home and community care program to assist the elderly and the disabled. Every year since then there has been a specific women's budget which has <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> detailed a range of initiatives, community services and entitlements to benefit women and their families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These programs have focused on improving equality of opportunity for women and, at the same time, increasing access to health, education, training, employment and legal services. The social safety net has supported families through Medicare, various family allowance payments which have been indexed to maintain their value, the child support scheme and a comprehensive child&hyphen;care program offering different types of care and financial support to maintain the quality of child care and assist with the costs of care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of these reforms have been studied by overseas governments researching appropriate models of social justice and gender equity. The Commonwealth secretariat responsible for making suggestions to Commonwealth countries has actually recommended the Australian women's budget process to Commonwealth nations as very well suited to implementing the United Nations Beijing action plan for women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what is the future of this process that has been built up over 12 years to highlight the need for gender policy analysis across government, not just in the social welfare programs but in areas such as Environment, Defence and Treasury? The benefit of the women's budget process has been to ensure that when we are planning at the elected level, the policy level and the implementation level the bureaucracy is familiar with gender policy issues. And what has happened just in the last eight months or so?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Already, the Office of Status of Women has been downgraded, with significant reductions in staff, therefore limiting its policy advice and coordination role in maintaining the national women's agenda. We heard in the estimates that the national women's agenda does not exist any more. There is no commitment to maintaining that process. Key initiatives such as the national women's health and family planning programs are set to be devolved to the states which will end the comprehensive and national planning approach to preventive medicine, and reproductive health and domestic violence.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5294">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Adele Horin observed, what is the point of having 26 coalition women in the Federal Parliament when they remain silent in regard to women's rights and the women's budget? I was very disappointed to find that the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Status of Women (Senator Newman), who is a minister and a person I admire very much for a range of initiatives she took, in opposition, in relation to women's issues and for a number of issues that she is currently working on, was yet unable to persuade her predominantly male colleagues that it was vital to maintain that women's budget process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand the difficulty of this process because I have been there, done that. I know there is a tendency for certain male colleagues, across the political spectrum, to say, `Oh, women's budget. That is not very important. Why do we have to have a women's budget?' I have heard it on my side of politics. It does not surprise me that this has been a decision from the coalition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to point out just why it is important to restore that women's budget next year. It is very sad that the Australian women's budget process has ceased when the United Nations, the Commonwealth Secretariat, Beijing, various countries around the world have homed in on that process and said, `Wow, if only we could have that process that identifies, across government, the key priorities every year for women and their families. It would make it much easier to ensure that policy is targeting those areas of discrimination that remain and those areas of priority that are so important for women and families.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Caucus Status of Women Committee&mdash;without the resources of a department&mdash;has prepared the only document that exists on the coalition's budget. It is this document that we released just after the budget, called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">For all of us or just some of us? Impact on Women and their Families of Coalition Government Policy &amp; the 1996 Budget</EMPHASIS>. I am hoping that that work will not be in vain. I would just like to run through a number of the areas where I have significant concern about coalition policies.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I start with aged care. I wonder if the Office of the Status of Women was consulted when some of the decisions were made in relation to aged care: an up&hyphen;front fee of from $26,000 for non&hyphen;pensioners to be charged for entry to nursing homes; in addition, residents who are not full pensioners to be charged nursing home fees of up to $34 per day or $12,000 per year; from July next year, rent assistance paid to pensioners in nursing homes and aged hostels to be paid instead as higher direct subsidies to the service providers; nursing home and hostel sectors to be merged into a single residential aged care program; and&mdash;this concerns me most of all&mdash;responsibility for delivery of aged care services to be devolved to the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure that some state governments have very effective policies. But aged care, like so many issues in this country, requires a fundamental responsibility of the federal government to set the standards and to maintain a very close role in ensuring that those standards are maintained. I do not believe that devolution to the states of responsibility in the area of aged care will produce the kind of quality or overall standard that Australian senior citizens should be able to expect. We will have a piecemeal approach, an ad&hyphen;hoc approach. If you are elderly in one state, that might be fine, you will have better quality. But in another state there will be a lesser priority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The abolition of operational subsidies for publicly funded child&hyphen;care centres is a major concern to many families using child care. And, again&mdash;if I can not be totally partisan in commenting on this issue&mdash;I know that the Department of Finance tried to abolish this operational subsidy year after year. When I was minister I sat at the cabinet table and, although I should not talk about what happened at the cabinet table, I can tell the Senate that year after year there was a battle to maintain that operational subsidy. To the former government's credit, we were able to maintain that operational subsidy. It seems that in its first year the coalition has had the wool pulled over its eyes: that operational subsidy is not necessary&mdash;let it go.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5295">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why is an operational subsidy so important? Again, it is a question of quality; it is a question of national standards; it is a question of ensuring that those children that are more expensive to cater for&mdash;babies under two&mdash;are cared for. Many of the private child&hyphen;care centres, no matter how good they may be, do not choose to care for children under two because of the additional costs. You can understand that from a business point of view. But, if you are running community&hyphen;based child care, you are concerned only with the quality and the provision of services to a diversity of categories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us refer to children with special needs. Many community child&hyphen;care centres are better placed financially to cater for children with special needs than those private child&hyphen;care centres that have to look purely at the economics of running child&hyphen;care services. They tend to go for the older age group and the more standard pattern of child care. So there are just two areas, aged care and child care, where I feel that, had there been a more specific approach to women's budgeting, a couple of those decisions may not have proceeded. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us move on. In this document, I cover community services, education, employment and training. Let us look at the impact of this budget on women. There have been major cutbacks, $1.3 billion over four years, to a number of employment training programs. There is going to be increased cost and wastage through the development of private training markets. There is the cessation of mentoring and support for young women in non&hyphen;traditional industries. There will be $6 million worth of savings in the years 1996&hyphen;97 and 1997&hyphen;98, cutting out altogether the following year. There is a reduction in staff. There is the closure of CES offices. There is the replacement apprenticeship program providing just a fraction of the funds and, to my knowledge, with no specific focus on women as apprentices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about the Family Court? Women are very dependent on the effective running of Family Court programs and family court offices. We have seen, particularly in my home state and I am sure in other states, the closure of regional offices with reductions in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> staff, reductions in hearings, reductions in counselling, an increase in general fees, and a fee of $40 per hour introduced for counselling services. Madam Acting Deputy President, if you are on a tight income&mdash;and many people are on tight incomes&mdash;and you have to decide whether or not you want to afford counselling, no&hyphen;one would deny that you probably should afford it as a priority in your budget, but it will not be surprising if some people choose not to pay that $40 an hour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We move on to family tax. There was a family tax package, and elements of that family tax package were sold as being of great benefit to women. But the family tax cuts, I would argue, have been offset by increased out&hyphen;of&hyphen;pocket expenses. There are 1.1 million families with children earning between $30,000 and $65,000 a year who will, over the next four years, lose around $295 per family per year as a result of cuts totalling $1,300 million in vocational education and training, child&hyphen;care benefits, parenting allowance, Austudy and, of course, pharmaceutical benefits rebates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We move on to health. Cuts to public hospital funding of around $1 billion over four years will impact on the quality of health services. The private health insurance rebate of $450 per annum is only available to families paying around $2,000 for cover, leaving them $1,500 per year worse off. The Commonwealth dental program will be scrapped by a cut of $399 million over four years. All these areas will impact severely on women and families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I could go on to detail what will happen in housing and Medicare, but I want to take a few moments to look at the needs of special groups of women&mdash;women who were given a special focus in the days of women's budgeting&mdash;such as migrant women. There will be a two&hyphen;year waiting period for newly&hyphen;arrived migrants to apply for Austudy and the child care cash rebate. The work place English language programs will be abolished. There will be increases in fees for language tuition. There will be a reduction in numbers of the Department of Social Security migration liaison officers.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5296">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another special group is women with disabilities. In Senator Newman's document, which was not a budget itself&mdash;it was a women's budget statement&mdash;there was no special recognition of women with disabilities. If I could say something positive for a change, it is true that there were good initiatives in regard to women as carers in the coalition's budget. That is one point that I will concede. I am sure you would argue, Madam Acting Deputy President, that that does impact on women with disabilities. But, as a category, there are so many women with disabilities. Under the framework of the women's budget that went out to all the community groups and to individuals, it was very reassuring for special categories of women to see that they rated a mention&mdash;there were specific initiatives for women with disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, what has been the impact on rural women? The abolition of the regional development program and national oversight of regional development through the division of regional development will impact severely on regional Australia with multi&hyphen;million dollar cuts to road funding, community based child care and services to pensioners. The closure of Medicare offices in some country areas and, again, the cuts in the job programs will particularly impact on women in regional areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to say, particularly to people like the Treasurer, Peter Costello, and the Prime Minister, John Howard, it is all very well to say `cut back the public sector' and `no need for such an expanded public sector,' if you live in the leafy comfortable suburbs of North Sydney or Melbourne. I doubt whether Mr Costello, Mr Howard and their families have a need for public services, and that is fine. But many families in other suburbs of those major cities&mdash;and certainly the major regional and rural centres&mdash;have just started to benefit from a decentralisation of services to regional Australia. When you cut back the public sector in the cities, sure, it makes a difference. But when you cut back in regional Australia, the services simply disappear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Madam Deputy President, I would be very happy to make sure that every woman mem ber and any other member on the other side have a copy of this document. It does provide a serious analysis of where the coalition government has gone wrong, particularly in regard to the impact of its budget on women. I hope that Senator Newman and other women members of the government will take a serious look at this document in their own policy making fora and will consider the return of the women's budget next year. I think it would certainly benefit the coalition government&mdash;which is perhaps no comfort to me&mdash;but, more importantly, it would certainly benefit women and their families to see the return of the women's budget so that we have a much more serious analysis of the impact of government policy&hyphen;making on women and families.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in the debate on the Appropriation Bills, which give effect to the government's first budget, to say that these documents are documents of deceit. They give with one hand and they sneakily take away with the other. The changes reduce services and they hike charges. But the hikes in charges and the loss of services are very often difficult to detect because, for the most part, they do not take effect until after 1 July 1996 or, in some cases, until even later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It really heaps scorn on the charter of budget honesty when you see that there is no real honesty in this budget and that in fact it is a document that deceives the community. This is a budget that breaks $17 billion worth of promises made by the coalition government during the election and subsequently. The basis of the budget is dishonest, as well. In its slash and burn cuts, it relies on a purported $10 billion deficit that the government says is the responsibility of the previous Labor government. This is certainly not the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government were honesty and if they were to have regard to the charter of budget honesty, there would be a concession that $3&half; billion of that deficit is as a direct result of decisions made by this Senate, prior to the election. If they were being honest about this budget and about these appropriation bills, they would concede that a similar sum accumulated in this deficit is as a result of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5297"> declining economic growth brought about by the policies of this government. As you would well be aware, as economic growth reduces, not only does revenue decline but also outlays in terms of social security and social services go up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, the intended effect of this budget is dishonest in that they say that, by reducing the deficit, they will bring about economic growth and, accordingly, jobs. But already the policies of this government have destroyed the hard won gains of 13 years of Labor. While keeping inflation low by putting in place mechanisms of wages restraint and by improving productivity and, at the same time, achieving an unmatched level of job growth, Labor maintained economic growth at approximately 3&half; per cent. Already, this government has abandoned these gains and they have returned to the tired old formula. First, there are slash and burn cuts, with no regard to the consequences. This in turn brings about a decline in economic growth; and then&mdash;surprise, surprise!&mdash;as we have already seen, unemployment goes up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last three months, we have seen increasing unemployment, and I sadly predict that that will exceed 10 per cent by the new year and that it will, at some time during next year, reach heights of 11 per cent. Unless this government changes its economic objectives&mdash;that is, its old economic objectives of low inflation, maintained by declining employment&mdash;then unemployment will continue to grow thereafter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To find further examples of budget dishonesty, you really do not have to go very far, because you can take a brief peek at the budget speech delivered on the 20 August by Mr Costello, the Treasurer. We can go through some of the issues that he has highlighted as the positives in this budget but, when you look very closely, you see that he has not given you the downside: he has not given you the negatives that go with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first item put forward is the government's family tax initiatives. They are a good thing and we on this side of the chamber agree with them. However, the Treasurer, when putting forward these tax initiatives for families, did not outline the negatives that are <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> secretly contained in the budget. As I said, often they will not have an effect until after the end of this financial year or perhaps even longer than that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are cuts of $1.5 billion to the states overall. If people do not think that that is going to affect the standard of services that are provided to the community, and the charges that are levied for those services, they are not being honest with themselves. Certainly, it is going to mean that people in each state of Australia will be paying more, well in excess of the paltry amount that they will be receiving from the government's tax initiative. And that is before you take into account the cuts to child care, the reducing eligibility for child&hyphen;care assistance, the child&hyphen;care rebate and the cuts to operational subsidies which will mean that, in community based child&hyphen;care centres, each child will be paying approximately $25 more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next item set out in the budget, and heralded by the Treasurer, is the private health insurance subsidies. A lot of people took heart from this and thought that it would mean more money in their pockets but, as we have seen with approvals by this government of 5.1 per cent in health insurance premiums, the small amount of dollars from the subsidies have been eaten up well before they come into effect on 1 July next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the next item heralded with enthusiasm by the Treasurer. In relation to older Australians he says that there will be a continuing twice yearly indexation of pensions and that they will make financial provision to maintain the age pension at or above 25 per cent. People might even think that this is a new initiative of this government but, in fact, it is something that we, as a Labor government, had been doing for quite some time. It is a good thing and this opposition supports it. However, the Treasurer failed to point out for older Australians the negative things that are contained in this budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He forgot to point out that, for pharmaceutical benefits, pensioners and concession card holders will have to pay an additional 50c on each occasion that they fill a prescription. He failed to point out that that increase in the pharmaceutical copayment would no longer <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5298"> be offset by the pensioner's pharmaceutical allowance, which is incorporated in their pension, that for the first time this government had chosen to break the nexus between pharmaceutical copayments and the pensioner's pharmaceutical allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He also failed to point out that, even though the pension was being maintained, the government is intending allowing nursing homes to introduce fees. That entry fee is estimated&mdash;obviously the fee is a secret because no&hyphen;one, including the nursing homes, have been given any details of the fee&mdash;to be, on average, if you extrapolate the entry fees taken for hostels, at about $26,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When questioned about the fee and about the $26,000&mdash;this is one of the cruelest and rudest comments I have heard from this government&mdash;the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) said, `Even though it is $26,000, most people will not have to pay it because it only comes into effect after six months and most people die before that time.' He also failed to point out that the HACC services, which the frail and elderly in our community access, will have payments imposed on them as well so, all in all, older Australians are not better off; they are pretty poorly off as a result of this budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another benefit promised by the Treasurer on 20 August was for regional Australia. He talked about increasing assistance to isolated students. The amount is quite small but it is something we should applaud, as an opposition concerned about regional Australia and about those people who are adversely affected by isolation.

Let's look at the promises put forward in the budget by the Treasurer under the heading of the environment and the much heralded Natural Heritage Trust. Again, some of the things contained therein that will be paid for through the trust are good things and we applaud them. But what they have done is set up this trust only on the basis that this parliament agrees to sell off a major monopoly asset that is owned by the taxpayers of Australia. If we agree to sell off Telstra&mdash;a body that makes money for our taxpayers&mdash;then they will do something, through the trust, about the environment.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to look at some of the items that have been dealt with through the department of consumer affairs&mdash;matters that have not been mentioned in any of the major documentation&mdash;and how they affect the community at large. The government in its wisdom has seen fit to remove all of its funding for consumer organisations traditionally funded by the government, except for funding provided for the financial counselling service. In cutting funding for both the Consumers Federation of Australia and AFCCRA <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5299"> they said it was being done in order to provide more funding for financial counselling. Lo and behold, when you dig a little deeper you find the funding for financial counselling has not gone up at all. In fact, it has declined by $200,000 and the budget forecast guarantees that this decline in funding will continue as the years go on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are approximately 45 financial counselling services funded under the Commonwealth financial counselling program which have continued despite these budget cuts. But there are two places&mdash;Roma in Queensland and Derby in Western Australia&mdash;where they will not receive the benefit of financial counselling because of this government's budget cuts.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is also directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate, and this is a question which the battlers will be much more interested in, I might say. Senator Hill, the benefits delivered to home owners and the business community&mdash;the ordinary battlers in Australia&mdash;by government policies have led to a 0.5 per cent reduction in official interest rates just recently, the second fall since the government was elected, resulting in an overall drop of one per cent. Minister, home owners and small businesses have welcomed the significant savings resulting from the latest reductions. But I understand and would imagine that the benefits go beyond small business people and home owners. Could you indicate to the Senate the positive effects that the Reserve Bank's decision would have on farmers in rural and regional Australia?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly, this was good news for all Australians&mdash;home owners, small business, as well as the rural community. There is no doubt about that. In fact, the variable mortgage rates are now 8.75 per cent, which is down from the 10.5 per cent when Labor was defeated in March of this year. Good news for Australians&mdash;and no doubt related, to some extent, to the hard but important decisions that we took in relation to the budget to rein in public expenditure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is pleasing to see that mortgage lenders such as FAI, Aussie Home Loans, ANZ and Westpac have announced that they will pass on to home owners the full 0.5 per cent drop. It is worth understanding that for average mortgages this means that these people are now $140&hyphen;plus per month better off. So, since Labor, home owners are now $140 a month better off. Good reason to have voted for the coalition, I would think.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Terry McCrann points out today that the average borrower with a $100,000 loan is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> now saving around $2,700 a year in interest payments. He said, `This is a permanent saving adding around $2.5 billion extra a year in borrowers' pockets.' That is a huge sum of money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Macdonald may be interested to know that, in real terms, these figures are now down to those that last existed about 22 years ago. The 13 years of Labor misery is behind us. We are now able to achieve home loan interest rates in figures that existed a long time ago. As I said, I have no doubt that our policies of low inflation and keeping public expenditure down, together with growth, have to some extent influenced the Reserve Bank to make this decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is pleasing that the community tends to respond positively to these hard decisions that we have taken. Madam President, you might have noticed that the Reuters poll trend published today shows that growth in support for the government has been rising decisively since the budget. That is really quite interesting. The two-party preferred lead moved even more strongly from seven or eight points to 14 points, implying a strong swing to the government among minor party supporters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Ian Macdonald went on to specifically ask about the benefits that would flow to rural and regional communities. I said that it is also clearly good news for them. That has been applauded. The New South Wales Farmers Federation has said that the official rate cut would allow annual interest repayments on total farm debt of $18 billion to fall by about $90 million. That is clearly good news for  farmers. If banks pass on the cuts in full, this will result in cost reductions of an estimated $90 million annually. That is why we say that they need to be passed on fully and quickly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This reduction comes at a critical time for the farm sector. Many are now in the recovery phase after the drought. I remind the Senate of the extra assistance we have been giving those in drought. Be they in or out of drought, a lower interest rate gives them the opportunity to grow and put themselves in a stronger economic position to take full advantage of seasonal rains and to try to restore the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5301"> important prosperity of that vital sector of our community.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Coonan for such a positive question. It makes a refreshing change from what comes from those opposite.

It is something I highly recommend to senators opposite. Tomorrow I will be hosting a meeting of state and territory youth affairs ministers. This is an important part of our commitment.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have some of the best educated and healthiest young people that this country has ever seen. We should be celebrating young people's achievements in all fields, such as education, employment, sport, culture and the arts. However, all too often, our young people are, sadly, perceived quite negatively. The media shares some responsibility for this. Young people are often stereotyped. A 1992 New South Wales study by the Australian Centre for Independent Journalism on how youth were represented in magazines and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5302"> newspapers found that most coverage concerned their involvement in criminal activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other problems include the very high rate of youth suicide. Statistics show that from 1994, 377 young men and 60 young women suicided before reaching their 25th birthday. The high rate of youth unemployment must also be very discouraging for young people and is one of this government's highest priorities. We are determined to raise the status of young people generally, to celebrate their success and to ensure that all young people have the opportunity to participate to the best of their abilities in society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our strategy is to increase opportunities through sustained economic growth, a reduced budget deficit, industrial relations reforms and help for small business to realise its potential to employ more young people, along with programs which are specifically targeted to assist young people. They include improving literacy and numeracy, provision of real, quality career paths through the modern Australian apprenticeship and traineeship system and an increase in the number of government funded undergraduate places at Australian universities next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tomorrow's meeting is an opportunity for youth ministers across the country to show leadership to send the right message to our young people that governments are determined to focus on their concerns. It is important to acknowledge that a large amount of work has already been done by the states, territories and the Commonwealth in this area. However, there are young people who live in circumstances that are far from ideal and youth ministers together must ensure that the most disadvantaged are assisted.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There were a lot of questions in there. There were certainly some about which I have absolutely no knowledge. Indeed, to suggest there has been some organised campaign in relation to the telecasting of the mardi gras is certainly beyond my knowledge and I certainly have not participated in any such campaign.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I did do several years ago, as I am sure is well known, is that I requested the ABC to consider scheduling the telecast at a later timeslot. Indeed, as I recall, the ABC received very many letters to that effect. I have not at any time sought to renew that particular request or make any personal representations on the issue. What I did do, however, after I had received a lot of letters on this subject, was to write and inquire whether the ABC had any plans for either discontinuing the telecast or scheduling it at a later time. The suggestion that somehow <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this issue has had special attention is simply incorrect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My standard practice&mdash;and I am sure it was that of my predecessor&mdash;has been to refer letters of complaint to the ABC. Many people would write direct to Brian Johns. If they write to me, I invariably send him a copy of the letter drawing the matter to his attention. I can give you a couple of examples. A number of the complaints that come to my department are raised by them with the ABC and are then able to be incorporated in answers that we give to people who write in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been occasions and I have one example. The ABC wrote to me on 28 October saying that the ABC had received a large number of complaints about one episode of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Backchat</EMPHASIS>. The inclusion of the particular footage in question was clearly an error of judgment as there were no warnings given to viewers and an inadequate explanation of the context. That sort of response is not unusual. The head of ABC television directed an on&hyphen;air apology be broadcast in relation to the same episode of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Backchat</EMPHASIS>, or it may have been another one. There have been other examples or occasions where the ABC has been able to advise the department, and I have therefore advised those who have written to me, that the ABC has taken corrective action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not unusual for any broadcaster to concede on reflection with the benefit of hindsight that some programs were either in poor taste or may indeed have been treated in other ways or warnings might have been given. There is nothing unusual about what has occurred on this occasion. Indeed, I think it is my duty to ensure that the ABC is fully aware of all of the complaints that are made against it. Otherwise, as far as it knows things are going along smoothly, when in fact there are a lot of people complaining directly and who may have taken the view that there is no point in complaining to the ABC any more. Indeed, to the extent that their complaints system does not always allow for a satisfactory reply to be given, it is not unusual for people to think that there is no point in complaining to the cause of the problem. Therefore, they write to others, including the minister. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5304">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I have done on each of those occasions is to ensure that the ABC is fully apprised of the problem. Where there are recurrent letters, as there have been in relation to the Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras, I took the view that it was time&mdash;some seven months down the track&mdash;to ask a general question about whether they had any intention of changing the programming or, indeed, the time of the programming. It seems to me that that is a little more pro&hyphen;active than simply pretending that each individual complaint is dealt with in isolation. When you have got enough complaints to form the basis for a general inquiry, then it seems to me that that is a prudent approach to take, and I did.</PARA></ANSWER>

Did he do that on every occasion on which he received a letter about the mardi gras, at least since July this year? Does he do that with every single letter of complaint that he gets about the ABC? Did he do that with every one of the 17,000 letters he received about budget cuts? Secondly, on the complaints system, where he said that he does not believe it is a particularly good one or words to that effect, does he not agree that the ABC's complaints system is in fact a lot better than the commercials'?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam President, I think there are two parts to the question. The first is Senator Brown's attack on a transnational corporation, which reflects a prejudice that he holds in general in relation to commercial operations of this type. In condemning Shell, perhaps he could have looked at the other side of the ledger and recognised that Shell in Nigeria has implemented a $100 million environment assistance program in Ogoniland, as well as a $20 million per annum community assistance program for the Ogoni people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apart from Senator Brown's using this question as an excuse to attack Shell, there is within the question an important issue, and this is the continuing unsatisfactory behaviour of the regime in Nigeria. We, as a government, condemn the systematic violation of human rights by that regime. We particularly condemned the execution of Ken Saro&hyphen;Wiwa and eight other activists last November, and joined in the decision to suspend Nigeria from the Commonwealth in response.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that the suspension from the Commonwealth has helped to isolate and embarrass the Nigerian regime. We use this sad occasion of the anniversary of the death of Ken Saro&hyphen;Wiwa to reiterate our concerns and to refocus our energies in relation to the Nigerian regime, particularly the efforts to compel it to comply with the international community's standards of proper behaviour. We will continue to look for ways to achieve that goal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We monitor the work of the Commonwealth Action Group on Nigeria. We are not a member of the group but we monitor its work. We notice that it is due to visit Nigeria again in the next few weeks. We have discussed the issue of sanctions and we will continue to do that as the Commonwealth seeks to develop a position on that particular matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bottom line is that the performance of the regime remains unsatisfactory. It does not reach the human rights behavioural levels which we, as international citizens, are entitled to expect.

Funding per government school pupil will rise, taking these assumptions into account, to 17.9 per cent compared with non-government per capita increases of 14.9 per cent. These increases will absolutely overwhelm any impact of the adjustment to government school funding which will arise from the loss of pupils. In other words, to focus on the enrolment benchmark adjustment is to focus on a very small part of the funding. Overall, funding is going up and there is good news for schools.

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I can. Shoalwater Bay contains perhaps the most important population of dugong remaining in the southern Great Barrier Reef. Many senators will be aware of the substantial decline in dugong numbers in the southern Great Barrier Reef area&mdash;a decline of between 50 and 80 per cent since 1986-87. By 1994 the dugong population had plummeted to an estimated 1,700 animals in this area. I understand that in over 1,200 kilometres of coast, only 1,700 animals remain. Of those, Shoalwater Bay is home to approximately 400 dugongs&mdash;therefore a significant proportion of the remaining dugongs in the southern Great Barrier Reef. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Dugongs occur in the waters of over 40 countries, but all except Australia are developing nations. That gives us a special responsibility for dugong protection. The cause of the decline in dugong numbers in the southern Great Barrier Reef may be attributed to a combination of the following: gill netting, habitat loss and disruption, shark meshing and indigenous hunting. Clearly the time has come for radical action to address the decline in dugong numbers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a first step in addressing the decline in numbers, I am announcing this week that I have approved for public release a draft management plan for the conservation of dugong in Shoalwater Bay. The management plan will ensure that Shoalwater Bay remains a sanctuary for these beautiful and graceful mammals. The plan will effectively ban all gill netting in Shoalwater Bay. I have determined that current restrictions on the use of nets in Shoalwater Bay do not go far enough. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5311"> There was evidence that the use of nets in the bay was continuing to contribute to the unsustainable mortality of dugong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Accordingly, I have taken decisive action to increase the level of protection for dugongs by, as I said, banning all gill nets in the bay. Dugongs, therefore, in this remote and scenic area will be protected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The plan has been developed by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority in consultation with interest groups, such as commercial fishers, conservation groups and Aboriginal groups. I am pleased also to note that the local Aboriginal people are contributing to the protection of dugongs in Shoalwater Bay by voluntarily forgoing traditional hunting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">GBRMPA will soon release the draft management plan and invite public submissions on it before it is finalised and comes into force. The protection of dugong in the bay will further enhance the exceptional environmental significance of the area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The development of this management plan for the conservation of dugong in Shoalwater Bay demonstrates this government's commitment to the protection of the dugong. It is, however, an initiative which will need to be supported by other measures in the Great Barrier Reef area. For this reason, the government has this year committed over $630,000 to dugong conservation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, I recently addressed a meeting of the dugong review group, including representatives from the key parties with an interest in dugong conservation, and I urged all parties to identify and implement emergency measures necessary to further prevent the decline of dugong in the southern Great Barrier Reef. I am expecting Commonwealth and Queensland ministers to be able to consider a package of emergency measures produced by this stakeholder group at the Great Barrier Reef Ministerial Council meeting to be held later in November. I believe that the dugong review group will identify a series of measures which will lead to better coastal planning, use of less threatening fishing practices and further dugong sanctuaries. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill), to questions without notice asked by Senator Faulkner today, relating to Public Service Commission guidelines on official conduct of Commonwealth public servants.</PARA>
<PARA>I want to say at the outset that I think it is an absolute disgrace that the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, has allowed the head of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet in this country&mdash;the head of the Australian Public Service&mdash;to moonlight for Victoria and make an extra $80,000 a year on top of his Public Service salary package of around $215,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a situation where the Howard government seems absolutely intent on changing the political morality of Australia to sanction self-interest. We heard a lot about this issue when it was said that the political morality of this country, with a new political consciousness and responsibility, was absolutely integral to the coalition government's conduct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What happens is this. Mr Max Moore-Wilton is pulling down a salary package as the secretary of PM&amp;C, in addition to being chairman of both the Victorian Public Transport Corporation and Southern Hydro Pty Ltd. Somewhere along the line, someone is not getting a bang for the buck. I do not know whether it is Victoria or the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has been exposed today is that there are some real questions that the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Hill, is unwilling to answer about the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Guidelines on Official Conduct of Commonwealth Public Servants</EMPHASIS>. Chapter 15 of this particular official code of conduct says that public servants are able to perform work outside the public service, provided this does not create the perception that they have placed themselves in conflict with their official duties, is not likely to affect their efficiency in the performance of their official duties, is performed <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5312"> wholly in their private time, and does not interfere with the performance of their official duties. There is no doubt that, in the case of Mr Max Moore-Wilton, he has breached all of those guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the same person who has been given the responsibility for inquiring into the acceptability and suitability of the Prime Minister's own code of ministerial conduct. He is the same person who has been given the responsibility by the Prime Minister of looking into the issue of conflict of interest with Mr Howard's own ministers. I assume Mr Moore&hyphen;Wilton has been given this responsibility because it takes one to know one. This is the same man who should be a self-appointed expert in the matter of conflict of interest because, categorically, he is in breach of the Public Service Commission's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Guidelines on Official Conduct of Commonwealth Public Servants</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A strong leader, a strong Prime Minister, would have said to Mr Max Moore-Wilton, `It's not on. You've got to set an example. You can't hold down a second job. You can't hold down a third job. It's not acceptable for the head of the Commonwealth Public Service in this country to be a triple&hyphen;jobber. Forget about working for the state of Victoria. You're expected to work for the taxpayers of the Commonwealth of Australia.' That is Mr Moore-Wilton's first and only responsibility. But, of course, John Howard is not a strong leader at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that I think the Prime Minister, in failing to act when his ministers were proved to have breached his key guidelines of ministerial conduct and now in failing to act in relation to Mr Max Moore-Wilton, has yet again demonstrated his weakness. Not only is he demonstrating his weakness; he is destroying the integrity of the Commonwealth Public Service. He is destroying and ignoring the integrity of these guidelines in the Public Service code of conduct. For that, the Prime Minister and Mr Max Moore-Wilton ought to be thoroughly condemned.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This government came into office promising the Australian electorate that they were going to set a new high standard of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> behaviour in office. They berated the record of the former government and, with a great deal of fanfare, tabled in this Senate and in the House of Representatives simultaneously guidelines for the behaviour of ministers, which they asserted set a new high standard in Australia for propriety and proper behaviour.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now know that those guidelines are dead and buried. We saw them buried here in the Senate and in the House of Representatives when a Senate minister and a Senate parliamentary secretary were sacked for breaching these guidelines. But ministers in this same government who have breached the guidelines to an extent far greater than those Senate sacrifices that bit the carpet are still in their places. The reason quite simply is that two victims were enough for this Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot be accused of being wise after the event, as a reference to the Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of May this year will show. I pointed out in this chamber a number of breaches of the guidelines in respect of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Have a look at the Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> and refer then to what I thought were totally unworkable guidelines in respect of keeping these ministers in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now have the very sad state of not only reducing these guidelines of good behaviour to the dustbin but now having prime ministerial support for also junking the guidelines on official conduct of Commonwealth public servants. Mr Max Moore&hyphen;Wilton was brought in to be the senior mandarin of the Commonwealth Public Service. That is what he is. He is top of the pile of mandarins. He is the leading Commonwealth public servant. He was brought in because of his well&hyphen;known reputation for being an expert in restructuring. I am not saying that in a pejorative way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Moore&hyphen;Wilton had a well&hyphen;established reputation for downsizing, outplacing, restructuring&mdash;whatever you want to call it. Indeed, when I was transport minister, the maritime unions used to say that Mr Moore&hyphen;Wilton should have been made an admiral in the Japanese navy because during his time with <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5313"> the maritime services in Australia he had sunk more Australian ships than the Japanese managed to do in the Second World War.</PARA>

And he is the senior mandarin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A couple of years ago I knew a senior Commonwealth public servant who was constantly passed over for these heady heights and was very unhappy about it. His workmates used to refer to him as `Cumquat' because he was small and bitter and wanted to be a mandarin. But he never made it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Max Moore&hyphen;Wilton is a mandarin. Since Max the Axe, as he is well known, has sacked so many public servants, robbed them of the only jobs they have, it has now been disclosed he has three jobs.</PARA>

Although it has been considered inappropriate for Commonwealth department heads such as Ted Evans to be paid extra remuneration for membership of bodies like the Reserve Bank, Mr Moore&hyphen;Wilton has been able to draw an extra $80,000. The Prime Minister arranged for an $80,000 cunning kick on the side&mdash;no worries. He thinks it is worth it to get a man who is empathetic to the coalition's views.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, Laura Tingle put the question to Mr Howard: was Mr Moore&hyphen;Wilton the only person considered for the job? The Prime Minister replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, you have to have the capacity to choose the person you want and you know, you don't go through a preselection procedure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I wanted somebody as head of my department who is strongly committed to the government's agenda, who understood the way the system worked, who understood the interface between federal government and state government, who was regarded as a strong performer in the private sector, had street credibility in the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Moore&hyphen;Wilton demonstrated his panache in my state of New South Wales. While sacking thousands of workers, he made sure he did it in style. His office refurbishments, signed off by former Liberal minister Bruce Baird, cost over $600,000. That is the style of this man. That is why he fits in perfectly with the Howard government. I am not sure why it was necessary to order his staff at the RTA to stop peering through the glass doors at his opulent new office refurbishment, as reported in the Sydney <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telegraph Mirror</EMPHASIS> .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I accept that the Prime Minister and Mr Moore&hyphen;Wilton are made for each other. Australian wage and salary earners may not be so understanding. They might not understand why someone earning over $200,000 should need to earn a second or third pay packet. That is what this is about.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5314">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why should that second and third pay packet be put into a cunning kick that is absolutely beyond the imagination of ordinary workers? They might ask why someone known as `Max the Axe' who is slashing the Public Service would feel that the money he is supposed to be saving for taxpayers should be spent on director's fees and, in the past, office refurbishment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Howard says that the positions with Southern Hydro and the Victorian Public Transport Corporation are only interim measures until someone can be found to replace Mr Moore&hyphen;Wilton. Ordinary wage and salary earners, I am sure, would be impressed with his self&hyphen;sacrifice. In my state of New South Wales, he did not extend the same consideration to the people of New South Wales when he resigned suddenly to take a job with the Stock Exchange, leaving his position at the Roads and Traffic Authority. What a ridiculous contradiction that is: in one place he nicked off to the Stock Exchange and, in Victoria, he was so careful to preserve the interests of the jobs he had in the past. The only difference is the $80,000 cunning kick that he is still getting and that is denied to ordinary people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He skipped out on the New South Wales Labor government when it was negotiating the lifting of the tolls on the M4 and M5 tollways. That was his contribution to my state of New South Wales. When you add it all up, you have a Prime Minister and a secretary who are perfectly matched; a Prime Minister who will lower the standards when there are problems and a secretary who will implement his will.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am speaking on an issue of great importance: the bill before the parliament which will make invalid the act passed in the Northern Territory dealing with the issue of euthanasia. As everybody has pointed out here today, that is a matter of great moment. Indeed, it is one of the biggest issues that have come before this house. The proposal is to send this off to a committee&mdash;as I understand it, to the Legal and Constitutional Committee. Mr Deputy President, I assure you that that committee is overloaded with work. Senator McKiernan has a reference which will take up much of that committee's time and I think it is absolutely essential that it be concluded quickly. It relates to the question of legal aid.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not sensible to send matters to committees when the resources of those committees are not sufficient. I am not saying this in any political way, but to put the matter in context there has been a reduction in the resources available to this Senate. It is a matter that we must look at sensibly. People on these committees tend to take on new issues out of duty. The secretariats who run these committees are outstanding people but are overgenerous in the way they give up their time and the way they work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this motion is to be put through, it should be put through only on the basis that there are going to be adequate resources provided to the committee. You do not work out what adequate resources are by going to the committee and asking them whether they can do an extra reference; you look at this sensibly and you say that there must be proper resources available. There are royal commissions going on all the time that investigate matters much less important and much less intense than this issue. No matter which way people vote on this matter, the Senate should keep in mind what is needed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will have to be, for example, resources from Hansard and from the secretariat. There will have to be people to take in the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> massive amount of material that will come forward on this issue. I think all senators here would be aware of the number of letters that have been written to them on this issue. I would like to stress as firmly as I can, and to get it through to senators within the chamber and those listening to this debate, that when they are exercising their vote&mdash;and it is a conscience vote, as it should be&mdash;they take into account the practicalities of this. If they are voting for the motion they should do so only on the basis that they would be willing to press hard for adequate resources to be given to the committee that does this&mdash;and adequate resources means a lot more than is presently available to this committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This committee is well led by Mr Bessell and other people up there over the years have equalled his enthusiasm, but that enthusiasm should not be simply made available at the whim of the Senate. Any enthusiasm that he shows&mdash;and it is great enthusiasm&mdash;should be answered with proper resources.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">In speaking briefly in support of that amendment, the Senate, like the House of Representatives, will have adequate opportunity to debate this issue at length. I do not see the need for a committee inquiry, given that we have all been involved in this debate for some months, there has been a great deal of community input and interest in the debate and all parliamentarians have had a chance to discuss it with their electors&mdash;people who hold views both ways on the bill.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5316">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee process would in no way cut short the debate in the parliament. All members of parliament will want to debate it and air all the issues. So there is no great advantage in referring the bill to a committee. We can properly explore all the issues in a full debate in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was not my intention in moving this amendment to unduly delay debate on the bill. There are no ulterior motives. If the bill is passed by the House of Representatives and comes before the Senate, I will be quite happy to get on and debate it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill is a conscience issue. It is a question on which every member of parliament will form their own view. Therefore, the committee process will not necessarily assist us here. It is better not to send the bill off to the legal and constitutional committee for some sort of legal debate, but to debate it as a full parliament when it comes before us if it is passed by the House of Representatives. So with those few words, I commend my amendment to the Senate.</PARA>

Very obviously, in this case, this bill deals with both constitutional and legal matters as well as health and medical ethics.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia contributes about 2 per cent of the world health and medical research effort, well above what might be expected from our population base. This level represents an investment in health and medical research across all disciplines by government, private bodies and the business sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It means that Australia has a role in the international research scene as a significant player. It punches above its weight.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Health and Medical Research Council funds about 22 per cent of Australia's health and medical research activity. This research represents the very best of Australian health and medical research with funding being awarded only to those who meet extremely stringent standards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It therefore gives me the greatest pleasure to announce today that I have approved health and medical research awards worth $159.8 million, to be made by the National Health and Medical Research Council in 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These awards, which include research project grants, large program grants, block grants to institutes and a range of career and training awards are a demonstration of the Government's commitment to maintaining Australia's highly regarded health and medical research base.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The funding of $159.8 million covers research which is continuing from previous years to the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> value of $96.6 million; new and renewed research awards totalling $54.7 million; and funding allocated for special research projects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has a worldwide reputation for the quality of its health and medical research&mdash;demonstrated in the last few weeks with the announcement of the award of the Nobel prize for medicine to Professor Peter Doherty and Dr Rolf Zinkernagel, for work they did 20 years ago at the John Curtin School of Medical Research when both were young post-doctoral researchers investigating cells which form part of our body's immune system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not least as part of Australian research efforts funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council, strokes and heart attacks have been reduced by half over the past 25 years&mdash;saving 54,000 lives from strokes alone; cot deaths reduced by nearly half in two years; kidney failure prevented in thousands of Australians; cost and illness associated with stomach and duodenal ulcers reduced by the discovery of a bacterial cause and a short course of treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We must recognise that research does not produce overnight results, funding of research is a long&hyphen;term investment to gain improvements in health. It is important that the support of basic research such as that conducted by Doherty and Zinkernagel is maintained, at the same time as targeting research funding to areas of health concern requiring more immediate attention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of significant links have been forged with other countries and other research funding bodies. The National Health and Medical Research Council has established Memorandums of Understanding on research cooperation with Germany and Switzerland. It has been involved in cooperative workshops with Japanese researchers. It has an arrangement for exchange training fellowships with its equivalent organisation in France and shared funding arrangements with the Menzies Foundation for a training fellowship to be held in the United Kingdom.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These are important partnership activities. Also important for Australian health and medical research is the investment of overseas funding bodies in Australian research.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am also delighted to announce that the Wellcome Trust of the United Kingdom has advised me that next year, in recognition of the strength of Australian science and the impetus given by the increased funding for health and medical research in this year's Budget, it will commit funding for the support of Australian medical research at approximately two and a half times its current level. This increase will bring the Wellcome Trust contribution to Australian medical research to about $10 million per annum. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5319"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Wellcome funding will be provided for various purposes. A significant portion will be to enable researchers to purchase major items of equipment, a very valuable contribution to the research effort.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other funding will be for a range of fellowship and training awards especially for collaborative biomedical research work in the Asia Pacific region. Australian researchers will also have access to Wellcome Trust grants in the area of population and reproductive health studies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Among the new research grants to be awarded by the National Health and Medical Research Council in 1997 is one to the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, an outstanding example of Australia's contribution to the international medical research scene, which will receive renewed funding for five years for its wide range of research programs which cover aspects of diabetes, cancer and malaria. The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute will receive over $8 million per annum as a block grant towards its investigations of the complex cellular and genetic mechanisms of the body.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other areas of research to receive considerable new funding in 1997 include research into musculo-skeletal diseases. This includes $1 million for new studies relevant to arthritic diseases. A number of projects will be funded, including a study at the University of New South Wales which will assess the most appropriate and cost effective treatments for common arthritic conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Research into asthmatic disease will also receive considerable funding. Over $1 million will be awarded for new research projects investigating aspects of asthmatic disease, including the links between various allergens and the development of asthma, preventive strategies and appropriate medication.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Research projects and training awards in the area of HIV/AIDS, will amount to $4.7 million in 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The problem of youth suicide will also receive attention. Studies will be funded into adolescent depression, deliberate self harm and substance abuse. One of the projects will include a collaboration with the Victorian Department of Education to provide suicide prevention health education programs in Victorian schools. Another will be investigating the long term effectiveness of psychological intervention in preventing the development of depression in adolescents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wanted to use this time in the  House to reinforce the commitment the Government has made to the National Health and Medical Research Council. For all diseases for which we find a cure there will always be new challenges ahead. As a society, we are making real progress in both fighting disease and promoting better health. Life expectancy for a male has increased from 59 years in 1920-22 to 75 <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> years in 1994. For a female, life expectancy has gone from 63 years in 1920-22 to 81 years today.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">To this Council of War against Disease I come to bid its members welcome. . . hope that their wisdom, experience and skill will evolve such plans as will result in further triumphs over disease and conduce mightily to the health and happiness of the people of Australia.</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill amends part 2 of the Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973. Part 2 of the Student and Youth Assistance Act provides for the Austudy scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill introduces a two year (104 week) waiting period for access to Austudy benefits which will, as a general rule, apply to migrants (including New Zealand citizens) who arrive in Australia on or after 1 January 1997.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill will give legislative effect to a 1996 Government budget decision to discontinue the payment of the untargetted operational subsidy to community based long day care centres from 1 July 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill will also give legislative effect to a 1996 Budget decision to apply a reduced rate of entitlement to the Childcare Cash Rebate for families on higher incomes, while retaining the current rate for families on lower incomes. This change will take effect from 1 April 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will also introduce amendments aimed at clarifying eligibility issues and compliance requirements consistent with the intentions of the Commonwealth Childcare Cash Rebate scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, currently operational subsidy is paid under Section 11 of the Child Care Act 1972 for child care places provided by community based services, but not for places provided by the private sector. 70 per cent of all centres are privately operated centres.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The repeal of Section 11 from the Child Care Act addresses the inequities in Government funding between families using private long day care centres and community centres. The removal of operational subsidy will place community based long day care centres and private long day care centres on an equal footing. It will also encourage greater competition and efficiency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Operational subsidy will continue to be made available for Family Day Care Schemes, Occasional Care, Outside School Hours Care, Multifunctional Children's Services and Multifunctional Aboriginal Children's Services. These services are crucial to meeting the diverse child care needs of Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Assistance will be provided to help community based long day care centres losing operational subsidy to restructure their business and to ensure families in severely disadvantaged areas do not lose access to child care. Over a two year period, $8.3 million will be provided to enable community centres to purchase financial and/or management advice to improve operating practices and adjust to the loss of operational subsidy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The withdrawal of operation subsidies for community based services will not affect the quality of care as this will be maintained for all centre based long day care services through the Quality Improvement and Accreditation System. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, there is presently no link between a family's income and their level of entitlement to the Childcare Cash Rebate. While access to the Childcare Cash Rebate will be retained for all families regardless of income level, it is equitable to apply a lower level of entitlement for those families who need assistance less.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Families with a taxable income in the current year lower than the family income cut offs for Part A of the Family Tax Initiative will have their benefit maintained at 30 per cent of their claimable child care costs, while families with a taxable income in the current year greater than these cut offs will be entitled to a reduced rate of benefit of 20 per cent of their claimable child care costs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This reform to the Childcare Cash Rebate ensures that Government assistance is targeted to those most in need, while still recognising child care as a legitimate work related expense.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further amendments to the Childcare Cash Rebate scheme implemented by this bill will improve the administration and accessibility of the Childcare Cash Rebate scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, the Government wishes to ensure that the Childcare Cash Rebate is available to those who are genuinely in need of assistance. The Government is equally concerned that those who do not have a legitimate need are held accountable for any payments to which they are not entitled.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To that end, further refinements to the operation of the Childcare Cash Rebate scheme will ensure that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">foster parents and persons with long term informal parenting responsibilities are eligible for the Childcare Cash Rebate;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Rebate is payable for two sets of child care fees for the one period of care in certain circumstances;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Health Insurance Commission has the power to suspend claims where a problem with a registration or claim has been identified;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Rebate cannot be paid for care provided by a registered carer to children of that registered carer's partner;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">carers must notify the Health Insurance Commission if their circumstances have changed, affecting their eligibility to be registered.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To further clarify the legislation, the definition of child care will be revised and consequential amendments will bring the Childcare Rebate Act into line with recent amendments to the Family Law Act 1975.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter concerns a number of applications lodged in Western Australia, involving previously affected state award workers, which have made their way through the system and the AIRC under a section 111 <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> application over the last three years. Then it went on appeal from the single commissioner to the full bench and a federal interim award was issued by the commission and upheld by the full bench in the middle of last year. Since then, applications have been lodged by employer interests in the High Court which have not yet been argued before, or determined by, that court. So I suppose the salient point is that the issues on merit have been determined by a full bench of the AIRC; there is an application in the High Court, in regard to the issue of the interim award, which has not yet been set down for formal hearing. That is my understanding.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the government&hyphen;Democrat amendment No. 21. Senator Sherry, because you are a Tasmanian, you might not know the local politics. I should remind you that you cannot have it both ways because, over in Western Australia, the Liberal minister in the state government, Graham Kierath, is extremely cross with the Democrats for the amendments we have managed to win on behalf of Western Australian employees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These important provisions were inserted in the act in 1992 to deal with the industrial situation created by Jeff Kennett's industrial reforms in Victoria that year. The Democrats supported the establishment of the fast&hyphen;track mechanism at that stage. This week, the AIRC&mdash;as we are advised&mdash;will proceed to make an interim award under these provisions for Victorian state public servants, the last set of award employees to exit the Victorian system for the federal system. Those provisions have now served their purpose. However, we do retain in the transitional arrangements a provision to allow all outstanding matters to be under the fast&hyphen;track mechanism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The provisions of 111(1B), (1C) and (1G) relate to the matters that the AIRC had to take into account in relation to state employment agreements. They are superseded as these matters are to be dealt with under proposed sections 152 and 111(AAA).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Importantly, we have persuaded the government to retain proposed section 111(1D), after some very heavy discussion, I might add. Proposed section 111(1D) in its amended form will require the commission to act as <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> quickly as it can to make an interim award if the commission considers such an award might be necessary to protect, for an interim period, the wages and conditions of employees whom the award will cover.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the making of an interim award is still subject to the commission being required under 111(1G)(ii) to determine whether to refrain from dealing with a dispute because it has been dealt with by a state industrial authority, the clear statement of legislative intention of the desirability of affording appropriate protection for workers under 111(1D), combined with the objects of this part in 88A and 88B and in proposed section 3, provide a clear impetus for the quick establishment of such awards.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed section was previously limited to employees whose wages and conditions are governed by a state award. The commission is required to cease dealing with such a dispute unless it considers that to cease dealing with the dispute would not be in the public interest. The effect of this provision is that a federal award will only replace a state award or state employment agreement where the public interest would be served by federal award coverage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new section also omits proposed subsection (2)(c), which specified as one of the matters to which the commission has to give primary consideration in determining public interest the history of the regulation of the employment relationship in question. Omission of subsection (2)(c) means that the matters to which the commission must give primary consideration in determining the public interest are the views of the relevant employees and of their employers. Where employees and their employers are in agreement as to the jurisdiction within which they wish to operate, they should, as a general rule, be permitted to operate within the jurisdiction of their agreed choice. Where they do not agree, the commission will have regard to the broader public interest considerations, having apprised itself of the views of the employers and employees concerned.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5326">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">New subsection (3) requires the commission to inform itself as quickly as it can about the views of the employees and the employers concerned, and provides that it may determine those views in such a manner as it thinks fit. Proposed section 111AAA, together with amendments to section 152 proposed by amendment 28, and the repeal of the fast&hyphen;tracking provisions referred to earlier, reflect the government's policy that employers and employees should be free to enter the jurisdiction of their choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">New section 111AAA is designed to ensure that federal award coverage will only displace coverage by a state award or state employment agreement where federal coverage will serve the public interest. Consistent with the principle of freedom of choice, primary consideration will be given to the views of the employers and employees concerned.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. I am speaking at this stage in respect of the opposition amendment 35 to save some time. What I intend to do&mdash;and I understand we have two further amendments 1 and 2 on sheet 224&mdash;is seek leave for 111AAA to be reconsidered. That is the advice we have had.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Speaking in opposition to government-Democrat amendment 22, the bill inserts a new provision which requires the commission to cease dealing with an industrial dispute concerning employees who are subject to a state award and state employment agreement, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> unless the public interest is against the commission ceasing dealing. In opposing this, we seek its deletion. The reason we do this is that it effectively precludes state award employees from seeking access to the federal jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If employees wish to seek federal coverage and can satisfy the requirements, they should not be deprived of the opportunity. So much for the choice that the government and the Democrats have been boasting about in respect of this matter. It is a limitation of choice; it effectively precludes it. The original bill only precluded the Commonwealth from acting where an employee was on a state award. Now, the provision also applies to employees on a state employment agreement. If an employee goes on to a state enterprise agreement, it will become almost impossible for the employee, if they want to, to get back on to a federal award. Hence my reference to this particular amendment moving the bill backwards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In concluding my remarks, I would like to draw the attention of the chamber to a speech Senator Kernot gave to the Victorian conference of the Australian Education Union on 15 June 1996. When outlining her concerns about a range of issues relating to the original bill she said on page 10 that its powers to grant federal awards to workers under state awards or agreements are substantially reduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to draw attention to the pre&hyphen;election commitment of the Democrats', which I have already referred to  in relation to 111AAA, to continue to support the right of workers to transfer from state jurisdictions to the protection of federal awards under legal provisions approved by the Democrats in 1992. For Senator Murray to claim that these provisions are no longer necessary is frankly exhibiting a gross ignorance of industrial law and a continuing need for workers under state awards or employment agreements to be able to fast track to federal awards if they so desire.</PARA></SPEECH>

<STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(4.16 p.m)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I remind Senator Sherry that once again his ground is undercut by just how angry Minister Kierath is about these amendments. Proposed new section 111AAA dealt with under government&hyphen;Democrat amendment <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5327"> No. 22 is now substantially different from section 111AAA contained in the original bill. Firstly, it will apply to state employment agreements other than those that meet the requirements of section 152. Secondly, in determining the public interest, the commission is required to give primary consideration to the views of employers and employees, but not to the history of the regulation of the employment relationship as originally envisaged by the government. Thirdly, a new subsection (3) will make it very clear that this provision is not to be used as a time delaying device, with the commission required to inform itself as quickly as it can and in such a manner as it thinks fit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed new section has the effect that a federal award will only displace a state award or state employment agreement where the public interest would be served by federal award coverage. It is the commission which determines that public interest. The intent of this is further provided in the explanatory memorandum. It will operate simply to ensure that the AIRC, before displacing a state award or agreement, asks the people affected what they think about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the explanatory memorandum makes clear, where the employees and the employers both clearly want to stay in the state jurisdiction&mdash;and I remind you that we emphasis that they should be able to jointly and freely agree to do that&mdash;then unless there is some other public interest consideration they should be able to do so. They should not be forced in one direction or another by either a union or an employer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where the employers and employees have a differing view, even where a few employees have a different view, the AIRC should determine the matter on normal public interest grounds. I do not believe that it is particularly terrible to ask the AIRC to ask these people affected what they think.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to read proposed new section 111AAA(3) carefully in determining how these provisions will work. How the AIRC informs itself is up to it not the parties. It is our intention that this be done in the simplest and quickest way possible, consistent with the public interest. I would envisage that if a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> union presents evidence of a workplace resolution in favour of the award being made and evidence of employers rejecting a log for a federal award, then they have satisfied the wording of that section. It is not open to an employer to insist on dragging these proceedings out to prove what would already be evident by that simple information process. From that point it would then fall to the public interest considerations as to whether an award should be made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to talk about state employment agreements and the operation of proposed new section 111AAA. I do not believe that this section can be used to deny employees who want federal award coverage from escaping a substandard state employment agreement. This is because such a decision would be clearly contrary to the public interest. Section 90 of the act makes it clear that in determining the public interest, the commission must have regard to the objects of the act and, in particular, the objects of this part.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">New object 88A is very important. It sets as the key object of this part that wages and conditions of employment are protected by a system of enforceable awards established and maintained by the commission. Object 3(d) also places a heavy onus on the commission to ensure that enterprise bargaining moves on to the foundation of minimum standards through any effective award safety net of fair minimum wages and conditions of employment. If a state employment agreement is below the standard of a federal award, there is a compelling public interest case for the commission to proceed to extend that award to circumvent that agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The term `state employment agreement' is defined in a new addition to section 4(1) and has four elements. One element is that the agreement prevails over an inconsistent state award system. That implies a state award system is underpinning the state agreement stream&mdash;a condition which is present in five of the six states in this country. The inclusion of this fourth criterion&mdash;`What is a state employment agreement?'&mdash;is consistent with object 3(d) of this act which states that the employment agreements will be based on a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5328"> foundation of minimum standards and that there must be an effective award safety net.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thus it would be consistent with a public interest to argue that an employment agreement which did not meet each of the four criteria in section 4(1), having regard to the objects, could not fall within proposed new section 111AAA. Given the protections within proposed new section 111AAA, as amended, the Democrats believe that this provision is limited to the effect described above and it is entirely appropriate for the Senate to support it as a protection for employees.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA>This amendment proposes a new item which would insert two new sections relating to exceptional matters orders and a proposed review of junior rates of pay. New section 120A relates to the orders which the commission can make in connection with an exceptional matter. This amendment relates to new subsection 89A(6) which permits exceptional matters to be included in an industrial dispute for the purposes of subsection 89A(1). I explained the concept of exceptional matters earlier in moving amendment 19.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The commission must not make an exceptional matters order unless it is satisfied that making the order is in the public interest and consistent with the objects of the act. The commission must not make an exceptional matters order that would apply to more than a single business unless it is satisfied that such an order is an appropriate manner of settling the matter in dispute. For example, if the order sought were to apply across an industry the commission, in determining whether such an order would be appropriate, would need to have regard to whether the matter might be more effectively and practicably addressed through an order or orders applying at the workplace or enterprise level or through agreements at the workplace or enterprise level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An exceptional matters order must be made by a full bench unless the order relates to a single business. An exceptional matters order ceases to be enforced two years after it is made and cannot be extended.

However, where agreement cannot be reached, a new <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> exceptional matters order may be made in relation to the same matter provided that the requirements of subsection 89A(6) and section 120A are satisfied. Exceptional matters orders do not form part of the benchmark for the no disadvantage test which is provided for in schedule 13.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">New section 120B requires a full bench of the commission to prepare a report for the minister on the feasibility of replacing junior rates with non&hyphen;discriminatory alternatives.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak against this provision. We have decided against calling this the Murray amendment on this occasion. We decided to call it the topless amendment. That is in response to the media release that Senator Murray put out yesterday, which makes reference to this provision and its alleged protection of in particular people in the hospitality industry, and some people in the entertainment industry, who may be coerced into working topless.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Murray makes the point in this release that the provisions of government&hyphen;Democrat amendment 23 would make it impossible to see a union failing in an application to the commission to maintain these provisions because their appeal would clearly be harsh and unjust if the order was not made. Senator Murray went on and said it <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5332"> was clear that Labor spokesperson Bob McMullan had not read or did not understand the protection for workers that the Democrats have negotiated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The negotiation in this case and the provisions provide that an order can only be made for two years and then cannot be renewed. In respect of the alleged protection that the Democrats have boasted about in their news release No. 96/740, the reality is that women can be protected from coercion, but for only two years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This press release of Senator Murray does highlight the lack of understanding of the protections that the Democrats believe they have been able to introduce into this legislation. It is deeply regrettable. Unfortunately, there are some employers in the hospitality industry and some other industries who coerce topless waiters&mdash;usually female, I would have to say; very rarely do we see any male topless bar attendants or waiters in the industry. The Democrats seem to believe that this provision will provide a union facility to protect employees but, unfortunately, it does so for only two years.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Sherry, you have just made my point for me. I have great admiration for your abilities&mdash;and I say that without any sarcasm&mdash;but I am afraid that you are wrong on this provision. Those orders can be renewed and shortly I will tell you exactly how. I rise to support government/Democrat amendment No. 23. This amendment seeks to insert two new provisions, one dealing with exceptional matters orders and the other with junior rates. I have already spoken about the exceptional matters orders and when they are granted. This provision contains a number of requirements on the making of the order as opposed to the circumstances when the commission can deal with an exceptional matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Subclause 120A(2) requires that the order be in the public interest and consistent with the object of the act. Of particular relevance to such orders will be object H which makes it clear that arbitration is available where appropriate. Object D(1) says that bargaining should be based on the foundation of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> minimum standards. Object A stresses the importance of a fair and flexible labour market. Object I is in relation to working family balances and object J is on discrimination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Subclauses 120A(3) and 120A(4) add a requirement that where an order is to extend beyond a single business it must be approved by a full bench as an appropriate manner of settling the dispute. The explanatory memorandum gives the example of a consideration of the appropriateness as to whether that matter might be more effectively and practicably addressed through an order or orders applying at the workplace level. Similarly, it might more effectively and practically be dealt with at an industry level. In the hospitality industry, the current award requirement that a waiter cannot be required to work topless without their consent is a clear example of a provision that should be retained to prevent harsh and unjust outcomes across the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To require hundreds and hundreds of workplace orders, each to defend human dignity in the hospitality industry, clearly would not be appropriate. Subclause 120A(5) says that the order can apply for only two years. This is to encourage the parties to try to reach agreement. The explanatory memorandum again makes it quite clear that if agreement cannot be reached or is reached in only a number of workplaces covered by the order, the union is entitled to reapply for the same order for a further two years, as long as the conditions continue to be met&mdash;in other words, it is a recurring agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Subclause 120B flows on from the repeal of section 90AB in relation to junior rates. It requires the AIRC to inquire into the feasibility of replacing junior rates with non&hyphen;discriminatory alternatives and to report back to parliament within two years. The report must include assessment of the desirability of replacing junior rates with non&hyphen;discriminatory alternatives; it must include the consequences for youth employment; and it must include the utility of junior rates for different types of employment, different industries and the school to work program.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5333">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In moving this amendment, the Democrats again commit themselves to the abolition of age discrimination against young workers. We believe that it is abhorrent that a 16&hyphen;year&hyphen;old is paid 40 per cent less than a 21&hyphen;year&hyphen;old, working side by side with them and doing the same work, just because they are young. I do not propose to repeat my comments of yesterday's debate&mdash;one or two of them in a loud voice&mdash;and will confine my comment to the process we have put in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said yesterday, the joint working party established under the commission to look at junior rates has failed to come up with an alternative which would deliver genuine wage equity for young people. We would prefer a real solution that takes a little longer to a sham solution that still leaves young people being paid less than adults doing the same work. The truth is that junior rate provisions in awards have never been reviewed. The restructuring of adult wage rates under the structural efficiency process basically passed this group of workers by.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, there is great commonality between the ratios of different age based rates to adult rates across different industries, suggesting this is based not on work value or competency assessment but on prejudice. Placing the onus on the commission to report on those matters effectively elevates the issue to the level of a major test case. It has a number of advantages. First, it requires the parties, particularly the employers, to put up or shut up on their claims that abolishing junior rates will cost jobs. I have never been persuaded by these arguments but they do deserve close scrutiny before we embark on a social experiment with the livelihoods of 220,000 young workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Second, it will allow youth and community groups excluded from the working party process to put proposals to the AIRC. Third, it will allow the canvassing of all the alternatives in the development of appropriate principles to move reform forward. Fourth, it will play an educative role in hopefully turning around the prejudices against the value of young workers which appear to be held by many employers and also a number of unions. Fifth, it will come up with a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> solution which is practical and fair and which will then flow through to the state commissions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That last point, as I emphasised yesterday, is important to us. The model we see for the case, the personal carers leave case, commenced as the result of a similar Democrat amendment to the 1993 reform legislation. I say `as a result' because section 170KAA provided an early trigger for commencing the case at a time when the ACTU, in this case, was dragging its feet. Within two years of that amendment the AIRC had concluded a major test case which has been adopted by all state commissions and has now been implemented. That is the process we are committed to. We believe it is a solution orientated process, not one dictated by slogans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should be pointed out that, while the commission is required to report back to the parliament on the result of its hearings and deliberations, that is not the end of the matter. Proposed new section 143(1E) makes it clear that any principles determined by that full bench will be capable of implementation. Further, the award simplification process in item 43(7) and item 47 will require the commission to have regard to any such principles on junior rates when reviewing awards over the next 18 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Section 120B combined with 143(1E) will allow the commission a further year's grace through to the year 2000 to implement its decision. I believe personally that three years is far too long and that the commission should aim to complete this process in much less time. Indeed, the 18&hyphen;month transitional period for award simplification, in our view, would be the appropriate time to also update awards to include new wage systems for junior rates and we urge the AIRC to take note of those remarks. In that way, in 18 months we would have modern, simple awards that totally eliminate discrimination consistently with items 43(7) and 47 of the transitional arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By setting a time line on the completion of the report, this amendment increases the importance and the stature of the process we are asking the commission to engage in. The timing of the case is up to the commission, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5334"> but certainly we would hope that the resolution of these issues is earlier rather than later. It would be our expectation&mdash;and that is why we have entered into this amendment&mdash;that the commission will invite submissions from unions, employers, governments, interested community groups, interested persons and, in particular, youth groups and youth organisations. Indeed, we would encourage the commission to adopt a proactive approach to informing itself on these issues, making a decision in principle and reporting its assessment to parliament. I commend the amendment to the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA>We believe that this provision is the minimum necessary for a union and its officials and representatives to be able to organise, to speak to employees and to be able to recruit employees in a reasonable manner. I say `in a reasonable manner' because the commission can ensure&mdash;and it should be the commission that does this&mdash;that there is no harassing of an employer or employee and no hindering or <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> obstructing of an employee in carrying out a duty of employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is absolutely crucial for effective union organisation. This is a balanced, very important and essential amendment. It is much better for the commission to determine union right of entry provisions than for parliament to legislate these&mdash;it is much better to do it that way. The commission is able to make more flexible provisions and take into account the circumstances of particular industries or the actions of particular employers or union officials.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion and from my own experience, taking the hospitality industry as an example, it is very difficult to go and talk to an employee when they are serving alcohol or serving at tables, but it is not unreasonable to be able to enter the premises and talk to an employee when they are in the rest room or on their meal break or their morning or afternoon tea&hyphen;break.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that the commission has acted in the past with respect to each industry in a very reasonable manner. Again, I say that it is very unfortunate that the Australian Democrats, by cooperating and agreeing with the government in this area, are going to make it difficult for unions to organise. The  officials that I have talked to, both full&hyphen;time and part&hyphen;time people in the union movement, have all expressed to me their grave concern at the government&hyphen;Democrat approach in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think this exposes the hidden ideological agenda of the government&mdash;the Liberals and the National Party&mdash;which is to make it very difficult if not impossible for unions to organise effectively. With the current provisions and awards as administered by the commission or as inserted by the commission&mdash;often by consent but sometimes by arbitration&mdash;despite the number of times in a year, which must be in the millions, that an official would visit workplaces around Australia interviewing employees, very rarely does the commission actually get a complaint or a dispute in this area. Why the change, Senator Murray? Why the change in this area? I do say quite sincerely that it is very regrettable that you have gone along with this change. There is no evidence that there needs <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5336"> to be a change to the right of entry provisions in awards. On the vast majority of occasions when right of entry has been exercised by officials it has been done in a highly responsible way. And, if an employer believes  that it has not been exercised in a responsible way, then the employer or the employer organisation can seek a variance of the particular right of entry provision in the award through the commission. I personally do not know of any such applications. There may have been some&mdash;I am not denying that&mdash;but they are certainly very rare and thin on the ground.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Section 127AA renders unenforceable any award provision or orders dealing with a union's right of entry. It makes workers in dangerous industries more vulnerable to unsafe work practices and complicates and lengthens the dispute resolution process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One example of where this right of entry clause will be removed from an award occurs in the building industry. Clause 43 of the national building and construction industry award provides for an automatic right of entry for accredited officials for, amongst other things, `checking safety conditions and regulations'. The Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union have described to me how this would affect their important role in inspecting workplaces to check on safety matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Safety is obviously of prime concern in an industry such as the construction industry. Around Australia each year, hundreds of workers die in occupational accidents. Most of these could be avoided with proper safety precautions. In 1993&hyphen;94, 60 construction workers were killed&mdash;more than one a week. The government claims that this bill will improve the efficiency of Australian industry: how efficient is it to have construction workers dying on unsafe building sites? How will these new right of entry provisions improve the safety of workers in the building industry?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me give you an example from your own state, Senator Campbell. On September 6 this year, a young CFMEU organiser named Mark Allen went to a demolition site in Western Australia. He and the other union organiser <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> with him saw several bonfires burning on concrete floors causing topping to explode. They saw workers up on the roof dismantling potentially deadly corrugated asbestos roofing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mark called the workers down from the roof to discuss his safety concerns with them. However, the demolition company boss threatened to call the police if the union men did not leave. Mark called Worksafe and requested that a safety inspector be sent to the site. He then climbed up to talk to the workers again. He was concerned about their safety and wanted to convince them to come down. As he approached the men, a section of ceiling collapsed beneath him. He fell 12 metres and died from his injuries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Will not the prevention of right of entry provisions into awards in dangerous industries such as the construction industry make it more difficult for union organisers to visit potentially dangerous workplaces? Will not employers be even less concerned with worker safety, knowing that the union must give 24 hours notice of an intention to visit, thereby giving the employer a chance to clean up a site at the last minute, having paid little attention to occupational health and safety before that point? Will not this inevitably lead to higher rates of industrial accidents and even deaths?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Section 89A(2)(p) provides that dispute settling procedures are allowable award matters to which the commission may apply its dispute settling powers. Can the parliamentary secretary explain how proper dispute resolution procedures can be followed without right of entry provisions? For example, the metal industry award contains a provision for discussion to occur with employees, shop stewards, management and union officials. Right of entry for union officials is thus both `incidental' and `necessary' for the effective operation of the dispute resolution process as set out in the award. However, this bill does not allow right of entry provisions in the award. How do you explain this contradiction?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What would be the benefit of removing the right of entry provisions from the award in an example such as this? A dispute occurs in company X regarding an employee's refusal <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5337"> to work with an allegedly unsafe machine whose guard is faulty. This happens all the time in industry. The shop steward institutes avoidance of dispute procedures, and the union organiser arrives immediately to assist in settling the dispute. The official is denied automatic right of entry under these proposals. The employer states that there is no award provision and no 24 hours notice pursuant to section 285D(2). Will not the dispute escalate due to having dispute settling award provisions that include the presence of union officials but not award provisions allowing right of entry?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about having right of entry provisions that are enforceable by the commission in the act but not in the award? What about the lack of right of entry provisions, forcing the dispute into the longer process of AIRC resolution rather than settling the dispute quickly and effectively in the workplace? What is the point of extending and complicating the dispute resolution process in this way? Why will you not leave right of entry provisions in awards as they are in order to protect the industrial health and safety of workers?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to add to what Senator Childs has just said, because I believe that it is a very important issue. I remind honourable senators that last night we went through a section which made industrial action for worker health and safety not allowable. We made it not allowable. It now becomes even more important that there be right of access for unions in this case to be able to maintain some ability to do spot checks on those important issues. All that we were left with after last night was schedule 14(2), which mentions whether the action was based on a reasonable concern by the employee. There is no ability at the moment to legally take any industrial action, including withdrawal from dangerous equipment. Last night, that section was voted against.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only can workers not down tools but they are also, as far as we know under the definition, not allowed to work with a particular piece of equipment. As far as we know, under that definition, that is also industrial action. There is also no right of entry for the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> union official to be able to assist in those cases. So you are making it not legal to take industrial action and barring unions from going in to be able to assist in those instances. Who will take legal responsibility for the deaths that are likely to occur as a result of this double jeopardy? It is leaving workers totally to their own devices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Section 14(2) does exactly that. It refers to an employee on their own. They can be forced to go into another area to work. They cannot even take any industrial action other than not work on the equipment or whatever that is likely to be faulty. There is not necessarily a big choice in many of those cases. I strongly support ALP amendment No. 7. I really want to know why there has been this double jeopardy in relation to worker health and safety issues in terms of the ability to take reasonable action and settle issues that occur in the work force without, for instance, having to give 24 hours notice.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also rise in support of opposition amendment No. 7. I acknowledge the comments of Senator Childs and Senator Margetts and add my own. In my former capacity as a union official in the building and construction industry, I have had no less than about 10 years experience of how important it is to be able to have the right of entry to a workplace. It is important for all the reasons that have been said. It is important because workers do not have the capacity, in the majority of cases, to be able to call in a union official without the employer intimidating or victimising that worker in some way. To rely, as this government and the Australian Democrats want to, on a mechanism which means that an employee has to formally request the presence of a union official compromises the variability of those employees to seek representation in a fair and meaningful way. This amendment puts back in place an effective mechanism to allow union officials to enter workplaces.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard about the need to be able to enter a workplace on an issue of occupational health and safety. There is nothing more important than a union official being able to walk into a workplace and raise with the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5338"> employer and the workers issues relating to breaches of health and safety standards. It is a fundamental role. It is a role that, despite all the enabling legislation that has been introduced in this country, is still there. With health and safety representatives, regulations, inspectorates and so forth, that problem has not gone away. The number of deaths and injuries still occurring in Australia shows that the problem has not been solved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government and the Democrats, by taking the position they have with respect to right of entry, are effectively denying working people another form of redress when it comes to an unsafe workplace. There is a need for it, particularly in a transient industry. As I said, I come from the construction industry. You do not have a defined workplace in the way you do in a fixed establishment. You have a workplace that changes from day to day, from week to week. It is a workplace that is progressing all the time because you are constructing something. If you need to go through a bureaucratic process to get access to that site, whether it is to try to enforce award conditions or health and safety, it defeats the purpose. It provides an out for employers who are not doing the right thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think Senator Campbell and Senator Murray know that we are talking about cases where employers do not do the right thing. Let us face it, some employers adhere to safety standards. I have to say, though, my experience in building and construction is that the majority do not. The majority do not adhere to the occupational health and safety standards, and there is always some degree of risk on the job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other issue about the building and construction industry is one of job security. There is not a lot. It is a transient industry. To hang on to your job in the building industry requires a lot more than just doing what you are paid to do. It is very easy in the construction industry to be targeted by your employer and moved along. It is easy because jobs come and go. The average tenure of employment for a labourer, for example, a non&hyphen;tradesperson in the building industry, is about six to eight months of the year, and that is on the positive side.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like you to explain to me how a complaint made by building workers, given the transient nature of the industry, is not going to in some way disadvantage them and disadvantage their job security. Why would an employer, if he could suffer no retribution under any of this legislation&mdash;and the way it is shaping up, they won't&mdash;hang on to an employee who caused them to expend money on something like occupational health and safety? You might say that does not happen, but I am explaining to you the reality of it. There is very little job security for building workers, particularly, and other industries are in exactly the same position. So if those workers make formal complaints, invite a union official onto the job, they are exposing themselves to a disadvantage with their employer. That is the reality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are trying to avoid that situation by inserting this clause back into the legislation. The government and the Democrats are not only denying working people access to fair and reasonable representation by union officials, but also they are setting up employees so that it is very hard for them to make a complaint. That is, of course, working on the assumption that they actually know what their rights are in the workplace. As Senator Margetts said in her contribution, so much has been removed from the allowable matters, including trade union training and occupational health and safety, that it is very difficult for those employees to have any access, firstly, to what their rights are in the first place, and, secondly, to have someone come in and educate them and, thirdly, to have a union official arrive on&hyphen;site in such a way that the employer will not be able to victimise any of the employees who lodged the complaint in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask Senator Murray if he could respond to that on the basis of the victimisation that will occur in transient industries where there is very little job security, and how those people will be protected if they do make a complaint. The reality is that if employers move someone along because they have made a complaint about safety or something else, when they sack them, they do not say, `I'm sacking you because you've made a complaint about <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5339"> health and safety or your award conditions.' They sack them because, `The job is finished and it's time for you to move on.'</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With regard to right of entry, I have seen on many occasions over a long period how very difficult it is for workers to deal with issues at their workplace, even if it comes down to how they are paid. One of the fundamental problems I have with what is proposed, and which I would like to put to Senator Murray, relates to this question of 24 hours notice. It is like sending a signal to the employer that there is a problem&mdash;you are identifying what the problem is, you give the employer a period of time to call together his or her work force and place enormous pressure on the workers at any work site, whether it be in the building industry, the timber industry, the retail sector or, indeed, in the public sector, such as health services, education or otherwise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It happens now. That is why workers, quite often, probably more often than not, ring up their union or a representative&mdash;and that includes workers who are not even in a union&mdash;and say that there is a problem at a work site. Quite often they will not give their names because of the fear they have for the security of their job. I know it is no good appealing to the government because that has been a lost cause from the start.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I certainly appeal to the Democrats, even though they have done a deal with the government, to rethink this aspect. As I said the other night, I hope they will have the courage of their convictions to support amendments to this act in the future when it is proven that some of these issues on which they have come together with the government are so bad and are having such an impact on workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats have proposed for the registrar to issue a permit for right of entry, and the permit can be for a period of three years. This seems somewhat illogical given the current process where the secretary to an organisation can issue to an officer of an organisation a permit for the purposes of right of entry. Other aspects include what can be inspected when they go onto a work site with <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the exclusion of AWAs. I know that has been dealt with in other areas. If you look at a work site that has an enterprise agreement primarily made up of AWAs, I am stuffed if I know how union officials are going to check on wages and get a complete understanding of the terms and conditions of employment of an employee given that AWAs are supposed to be secret documents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now turn to things that have been removed from allowable matters, such as occupational health and safety. We have a real problem with workers compensation costs in every state, and state governments have embarked upon a campaign to try to encourage workers to be more aware of occupational health and safety matters. I do not care who it is, but anyone who is honest in this process will know that in most industries, if not all, in some pockets of employment there are problems with regard to the standard of occupational health and safety. That is under the existing arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You cannot tell me that it is going to get better if the existing mechanisms for keeping some of these people up to the mark are weakened. In the case of occupational health and safety, if there is a problem you now have to give 24 hours notice before you can go onto a site. This is a ridiculous situation. I think the evidence ought to have been fairly clear to Senator Murray during the inquiry when the number of people, particularly young people, gave evidence to the committee of the difficulties they confronted when they raised issues with their employer regarding contractual arrangements of employment. In the case of Western Australia, I can recall at least three people who gave evidence that, when they refused to take certain terms and conditions on board or have those included in the workplace agreement, they suffered the consequences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where a union suspects breaches of conditions of employment or occupational health and safety, it can take immediate action. That is the way it should be. I can imagine ringing up an old company like North Broken Hill, which I used to have a lot of dealings with regarding employment matters, and giving them 24 hours notice of a problem that they <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5340"> had. I have to say that they did try to take that course of action because I thought in the award covering them they did not have an appropriate right of entry clause. So they used to try to require at least a period of notice. The next step will be that you will have to identify the reason why you are going on site.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think it will take too long before employers will exploit this. I would be interested to hear Senator Murray's explanation why employers will not exploit it and how workers can be provided with genuine protection in terms of the conditions in which they work. If he cannot explain, then I believe he does not understand the difficulties which workers are confronted with. I do not say that in any derogatory sense, because I think you have to have experienced a lot of these things first hand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can recall a young bloke who worked for Toys `R' Us in Queensland who came before the committee. I draw to your attention what he said and the view that he expressed. He suffered victimisation simply because he involved the union. He sought from the union information. Union officials did not come on site. He did not want them to come on site because he was too scared about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are the sorts of things that you are now proposing to put into an act to exclude a right of genuine protection for workers. They will not be allowed to ring up at night and ask their union to come the next day or in some instances, in the case of shift workers, that night. That is a real problem. I think the Democrats should think long and hard about that. As I said before, there is not much point in asking the government to change their mind. I know their position. We would not have right of entry at all if it were up to them. What we have in terms of the Democrats' arrangement with the government is not much better.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no doubting the sincerity of the remarks made so far. I would like to begin my remarks by agreeing that the original bill was unacceptable to the Australian Democrats in this area and we therefore expressed our opposition to it. Consequently, we have won amendments from the govern <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> ment for which union leaders have told us they are extremely grateful. Opposition senators should not give the impression that there is lack of support for the amendments we have won. Obviously, there are other provisions which are desirable but we need to deal with two separate issues here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first is that occupational health and safety has always been a state matter, dealt with under state law. That has been the recourse for issues that need resolving. The award system has assisted unions and the act to interact with the state governments in this area. Obviously, the current system has many problems because, as previous speakers have outlined, things are happening now that people are not happy with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the amended bill there is no restriction on union officials under proposed section 285(5C) from going into any workplace and discussing with any employer an occupational health and safety matter and then, as they are entitled to do at the moment, having it resolved under the existing law. Further, there is nothing in this proposed legislation which would preclude employers and employees agreeing, in a certified agreement or any other industrial instrument, to an expanded right of entry regime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With selected industries, the circumstances attaching to arbitration on a dispute over working conditions can be harsh and unjust. There are appropriate mechanisms as well. We have negotiated with the government for what we consider to be a much more balanced and extensive right of entry regime, and that is contained in schedule 15. I will speak at length on those provisions when we come to that schedule. However, I should say right now that one of the fundamental differences is really a shift in the kind of regime under which right of entry will reside.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a statutory scheme to replace the award based scheme. It follows the same direction that the New South Wales Labor government has followed in its legislation. In that legislation they have opted for a statutory rather than an award based right of entry regime.

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="H15">Senator CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps not to Senator Murphy's satisfaction. I think that Senator Lundy was under a misapprehension in relation to a number of matters. She talked about having to go through a complicated bureaucratic process every time a union official wanted to enter a site. She might not be aware of the intention of the bill as amended to ensure that a permit is not required for each entry; permits will be issued for three years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, an employee does not need to make a request. The union can make application for a permit without a request coming from an employee. That is something Senator Lundy seemed to be unaware of.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="H15">Senator CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is quite clear. We have not hidden from the fact that there would have to be a union member on site. But Senator Lundy was talking about intimidation of a union member for having requested a visit. Under amendment 160&mdash;which, as Senator Murray so eloquently said, was supported by the Australian Democrats&mdash;the member does not have to make a request. The union can make the request, seek the permit and go onto the site. Again, Senator Lundy might have thought that was not the case and so, unintentionally, misled the debate in that respect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Lundy also made comments about workers knowing their rights. I thought her comments unusual for someone who voted against the Office of the Employment Advocate, which office was designed to ensure that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> workers, if they so chose, had the right to avail themselves of information from trade unions.

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to again draw the attention of honourable senators to the report of the Senate Economics References Committee. I will quote Senator Murray who, on behalf of the Australian Democrats, said this in respect of the right of entry clause:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats support in general terms the analysis and conclusions by the Majority report in relation to the exclusion of `right of entry' clauses from awards. There was very little evidence to the committee that the current regulation of the right of entry to workplaces by award clause was in any way inadequate. However, very strong arguments were presented by unions, workers and industrial lawyers to the committee that the impact of the Government's proposed changes would be to unnecessarily restrict the access of union officials to workplaces for the purposes of talking to members and prospective members.</PARA>
<PARA>I would also draw this to Senator Murray's attention: I attended about half the hearings and I read the employer submissions. I specifically refer here, Senator Murray, to the employer submissions. I can recall a great number of issues raised by employers in respect of the bill&mdash;and you might correct me if I am wrong&mdash;but I cannot recall one employer submission criticising the current provisions in the act as to the right of entry. I cannot recall one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can recall a lot of other criticisms that we may or may not agree with, but this is one area where there was considerable criticism of the government's proposals and there was not any support from employer submissions. Senator Murray, you have said that you forced the government to compromise. All you have done in this area is turn what is, in our eyes, a manifestly, grossly, horrible provision into a woefully inadequate provision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Murray, in the glory of your media coverage just over a week ago you launched the agreement that you entered into with the government&mdash;the document that we have been working from and for which you have voted time and time again. You cannot shirk from your responsibility by arguing that you made such a dreadfully, woefully bad provision. You have drawn it back a bit but you have still left us with what is a very bad provision indeed in respect of right of entry.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5343">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, I can only appeal to the Australian Democrats&mdash;if they have listened to the argument and the debate that is being presented. I do not believe there is any evidence, any good reason, why the current provisions in the act should not stand as they are. They should not be changed in any way. The matter should be left to the commission. The Leader of the Australian Democrats (Senator Kernot) also referred to this right of entry issue in her speech to the Australian Education Union Victoria conference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot find the particular provision. Frankly, I am not sure that that is going to make a lot of difference, but I know it is referred to in this speech somewhere. All I can do, again, is appeal to the Australian Democrats not to support the government in this area of right of entry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment does not just go to the issue of health and safety; it goes to fundamentally being able to recruit union members. Senator Murray has touched on the fact that health and safety is a very important issue, but this goes fundamentally to being able to recruit and sign up people to a union and discuss things with them. These restrictions are horrible. As I have said on a number of occasions in this debate, the position that the Australian Democrats have adopted on this issue is very disappointing.</PARA></SPEECH>

The Australian Democrats have consistently agreed with the government that unions should not have a right to go into a workplace for the express purpose of looking at the books when they have no members in that workplace. We agree with the unions that they should&mdash;and we have achieved this&mdash;be able to go into any workplace for the purpose of recruitment.

In respect of amendment 46, the bill provides that a determination to the commission is not discriminatory merely because it provides for junior rates of pay.

<PARA>The bill repeals reference to an award including provisions relating to superannuation benefits. We want to delete this repeal.

There was some debate about this yesterday and I will conclude my comments there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill repeals the requirement for the commission to review awards every three years. We delete this repeal. Why? The award simplification process provided in the bill by section 89A and the transitional provisions&mdash;we will be referencing later to amendment 56&mdash;is far too severe as it ensures that many employees will lose existing award entitlements. The section 150A review process, although not perfect, has achieved award simplification and should be permitted to continue. There has been some extensive discussion of these matters.</PARA>

<PARA>In amendment No. 21 we incorporate a provision which protects employees' wages, accumulated annual leave entitlements, termination payments, long service leave entitlements and superannuation entitlements in the event that an employer becomes insolvent. Currently, employees are often very low on the list of creditors&mdash;and they can suffer greatly if prevented from being paid the entitlements they are due. This amendment attempts to rectify the situation. Provisions of the new section 150B give the Australian Industrial Relations Commission a discretion to deal with applications for award based protection of accrued award and legislatively based entitlements in circumstances where the employer becomes insolvent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is only fair that a caring society ensures that those who can least afford to lose their lawful entitlements are the ones most effectively protected by the law. In recent years we have seen the advancement of employees' priority in bankruptcy cases ahead of the tax office. However, employees lag behind secured creditors. Countries such as France and Spain have legislated to protect workers' rights in these circumstances and the previous ALP government indicated its intention to address the issue in accord mark 8. In the absence of a legislative response, the Greens believe that the Australian Industrial Relations Commission should conduct a test case into this matter and the commission should be <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5348"> given guidance to ensure that an optimum level of protection is available for employees.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA>This is a very important provision. It covers the circumstances in which a state agreement can override a federal award.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We have said that a state agreement can override a federal award only where it meets the basic requirements for a federal certified agreement or Australian workplace agreement&mdash;that is, the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> agreement has been approved by a state industrial authority as one that does not disadvantage employees in comparison with their entitlements under their award; the agreement was genuinely made; and the agreement covers all workers whom it will be reasonable to cover having regard to matters such as the nature of the work performed and the relationship of the employees covered to the rest of the business. At present only three states meet this requirement: New South Wales, South Australia and Queensland. I note that the Queensland government has announced plans to rewrite its industrial laws and it remains to be seen whether the new Queensland laws will meet the requirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This provision recognises the role that the federal jurisdiction has increasingly played over the last four years of providing a fair and reasonable safety net protection for employees seeking to flee any unfair and unbalanced legislation such as that in the conservative state governments of Western Australia and Victoria. Already virtually all Victorian workers and most Western Australian workers have moved to the federal jurisdiction to avoid harsh and unfair anti&hyphen;worker industrial legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The originally drafted section 152 would have allowed employers to undermine John Howard's `No workers will be worse off' pledge by simply undermining federal standards by moving to substandard state agreements. The modification we have made will ensure that John Howard's promise is able to be kept. But at the same time it will ensure that employees and employers can choose the appropriate jurisdiction for the regulation of their employment arrangements whether it be state or federal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This section will set the standard for the state industrial relations system. The message it sends is this: either states like Tasmania and Western Australia bring their industrial systems up to standard or risk losing the rest of their workers as Victoria has done. Already the Western Australian minister, Graham Kierath, is reviewing his legislation to bring it up to the federal benchmark. The Tasmanian parliament has set up a committee to review its state industrial legislation, which I <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5349"> think will follow suit. The Queensland government, in rewriting its legislation, knows that this is now the benchmark. As such, this is an enormously important provision capable of extending the no disadvantage test beyond federal awards to state awards simply by being here. I therefore commend it to the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amended section 152 will also make it clear that arbitrated awards under section 170MX, that is, awards made due to a failed bargaining period, will override state agreements. This is because federal certified agreements override state agreements and, as 170MX awards are akin to certified agreements, their treatment should be similar.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition will be opposing schedule 5, item 37. Our opposition amendment No. 52 relates to paid rates awards. It is a very important issue. I know we have debated it on previous occasions but the abolition of paid rates awards&mdash;under the agreement between the Democrats and the Liberals&mdash;does set up an alternative arrangement which makes access to paid rates awards far more difficult. We would argue that the existing position should be permitted to continue. That view is certainly in the submissions made to us by organisations such as the unions representing teachers and nurses. That is what they desire.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> It is not just because they desire this; it is commonsense to allow the paid rates awards provisions to apply but, in particular, these two organisations&mdash;representing very important groups in our community and there are also a number of other organisations&mdash;have <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> submitted very strongly that they should continue.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will definitely support the opposition's proposal in respect of item 37, largely because it has the same effect as our amendment No. 22. As part of a move to abolish the Australian Industrial Relations Commission's bargaining division, the government has moved to eliminate the AIRC's power to make paid rates awards. We oppose this change and it is interesting to note that the Democrats deleted this provision in their amendments. Paid rates awards are an important aspect of both the public and private sectors and are supported by many community groups who see them as protecting the wages and conditions of low&hyphen;paid and vulnerable workers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many submissions to the committee highlighted the need to retain paid rates awards. The Women's Industrial Relations Lobby, for example, said in their statement of concerns that they were particularly concerned about:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The abolition of paid rates awards and their replacement with minimum&hyphen;rates awards. . . many women work under paid rates awards, including those in community services, health and education. The abolition of paid rates awards in those areas will lead to a reduction, over time, in pay in these areas and to an increase in the gender pay gap.</PARA>
<PARA>The Association of Non&hyphen;English Speaking Background Women of Australia also highlighted this issue in their submission to the committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposal to repeal the AIRC's power to make paid rates awards will have implications for women workers, particularly in the public sector. Non&hyphen;English speaking background women who are employed in the public sector are concentrated in the clerical and lower&hyphen;grade levels with poorer bargaining opportunities. Paid rates awards have ensured some pay equity and this would be jeopardised if paid rates are abolished.</PARA>
<PARA>I support this amendment. It is the same as ours. I hope the rest of the chamber, including the Democrats, will support it as well.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(6.59 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5353"> opposed to this amendment. The government proposes to repeal legislative provisions relating to paid rates awards subject to providing access to arbitration in special and isolated cases where the parties are unable to reach an agreement. I refer honourable senators to government amendments 105 and 107 to schedule 9 in that regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rationale for removing paid rates awards is that their continuation is inconsistent with the new agreement&hyphen;oriented environment where awards provide a safety net of fair minimum wages and conditions. The government amendments to the award simplification arrangements will protect employees' overall entitlements to pay when award rates of pay are being converted to be expressed minima.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where awards, such as paid rates awards, are being varied so that rates of pay are expressed as minima, the commission must include provisions to ensure that the overall entitlements to pay provided in the awards are not reduced by variation. The only circumstances in which such provisions are not to be included are where the commission considers it would be in the public interest not to include them. I refer honourable senators to government amendment 30 in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's position is that the need for different types of awards has disappeared and the general continuation of them would be inequitable. At the same time, the government's amendments to the legislation reinforce our clearly stated position that the transition to minimum rates awards is not a threat to the terms and conditions of employment of workers customarily covered by paid rates awards.</PARA></SPEECH>

<STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(7.01 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats oppose the retention of part 6C. That is not because we are opposed to the retention of paid rates awards. Rather, it is because we believe that this amended bill actually provides for paid rates awards in a much more effective way. Paid rates awards are necessary where there is an imbalance in bargaining power. This occurs in the government sector because the government has massive legal, political and financial power to bring to bear <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> against its unions. But it also occurs in industries like oil and transport because their unions have the ability to bring a company to its knees with wildcat strikes. Hence the need for paid rates awards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill has been amended by the Democrats to provide for paid rates awards under 170(MX) where the parties cannot reach agreement on a certified agreement. There is a much broader right to arbitration for failed bargaining than exists under the current act. That is a massive benefit to paid rates employees. It says that you do not have to agree to a substandard bargain; you can take the option of putting your concerns before the commission. Proposed section 170(MY) makes it clear that this award is not restricted to being a paid rates award. Item 44 of the transitionals makes it clear that award simplification does not apply to those awards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are serious problems with the wording of the unamended part 6C which, it seems, the ALP and the Greens might have closed their eyes to. Since the Bell Bay case, it has been quite clear that most awards that we know of as paid rates awards do not fit the definitions in this part. Indeed, if the part were to be retained, it would have to be substantially amended. The retention of the part in its current flawed state will create more legal problems in the future than are fixed. In all the circumstances, I believe that the solution the Democrats have negotiated with the government will retain access to paid rates arrangements and award increases instead of leading to failed bargaining, and that is when it is needed.</PARA></SPEECH>

<STATE> (Tasmania)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(7.03 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report of the committee is pretty clear on a number of things, including paid rates awards. It refers to the fact that the Queensland Chamber of Commerce, for example, said that it did not necessarily advocate paid rates awards being abandoned, so I am not certain why this issue is being pushed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know quite a number of smaller retailers who have supported and continued to support paid rates awards because that gives them certainty about what they need to pay their employees. Other retailers&mdash;mavericks who <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5354"> might not have the same respect for their employees as the people I am talking about&mdash;could come to an agreement with their employees, their shop assistants, at a very much lower level than the paid rates awards applying right across the board for other small retailers who have not struck some sort of bargain with their employees through the union.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under those circumstances, I ask Senator Campbell whether he thinks it is better that those retailers&mdash;some of whom are quite harsh on their employees&mdash;are in a situation where, as a result of this amendment, there are no paid rates awards and where they come to an agreement with their staff which is below the standard of the paid rates award? There is a power relationship, with the employers having the unfair balance of power over their employees. They are at a substantial economic advantage over those retailers who have paid rates awards and who will engage in collective bargaining with the relevant union. Is that fair?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Harradine, thank you for the question. There are two main points that I need to make in response to what you have asked.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am advised&mdash;I do not know this on my own authority; I am advised by people who do&mdash;that most people covered by paid rates awards are now covered by agreements. There are some that are not, of course, that you have referred to. You have a genuine concern about people making agreements that are below what you would rather they be entitled to. Under the no disadvantage test, it is unlawful for that to happen. The advice is that, because of the no disadvantage test, those agreements just simply cannot occur. If they did, they would be unlawful anyway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those people who are covered by paid rates awards and where agreements cannot be struck, the proposed section 170MX will provide access for those people to paid rates awards. We believe that those concerns are covered in those three respects.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This matter has been raised by a number of people. I am coming from the perspective of an employer; that is one of the reasons that I raised it. I do not quite agree with what you have said in respect of the no disadvantage test. That may now apply but when you go along the track and you come up to renegotiating a situation, then you may find that the whole ball game has changed. We are not in a period of high inflation, but if we were you might have a situation after three, four, five or six years whereby there would be no hope of those persons who are unrepresented in a bargaining situation achieving what they previously would have expected to achieve had the commission had the ability to make paid rates awards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose you could say that my concern really is one of organisation, of employees being able and encouraged to belong to organisations so that there is fairness all round. That is another discussion we will have at a later time. That may well be the time when I should be raising these matters.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill represents a significant milestone for the Australian wool industry. It is the culmination of extensive consultation and co&hyphen;operation within the industry and clearly demonstrates the industry can come together on issues of critical importance to its future. It reflects a willingness of the industry to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> work together that I hope will remain a feature of the industry for many years to come.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This government has worked alongside the industry during a very difficult period to help reach the consensus approach to the package of measures reflected in this bill. It is a mark of the level of co&hyphen;operation and the recognition of the need for a consensus which brought the industry and government together to resolve this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill represents the final stage in the disposal of the wool stockpile which was created during the last years of the reserve price scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The stockpile and the associated debt are both now at a level which is less than half that which had built up in the early 1990s. To a very large extent this is a tribute to the fixed release schedule which has operated since 1994. This government supported the implementation of the fixed release schedule on the basis that it presented a sound mechanism for disposing the stockpile and removing the detrimental effect it was having on the entire wool market. Only through the success of this arrangement has the industry been given the opportunity to review and recommend change to the disposal schedule to enable Wool International, as the stockpile manager, to exercise greater commercial flexibility and responsiveness in the interests of the wool market overall.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides for a package of measures which will see the stockpile finally cleared by 31 December 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The package broadens considerably the range within which Wool International is required to sell stockpile wool each quarter. The quarterly minimum disposal requirement is reduced from its current level of 182,000 bales per quarter first to 135,000 bales per quarter from 1 January 1997 to 30 June 1997 then reducing to 90,000 bales per quarter from 1 July 1997. The quarterly maximum disposal requirement is increased from 192,000 bales per quarter to 350,000 bales per quarter from 1 January 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The intention of broadening the disposal range is to provide Wool International with considerably greater commercial flexibility to sell more in a rising market and sell less in a softer market.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The expectation is that this will ease the pressure on the fresh wool market at more critical periods in the wool market cycle.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the Wool International board will need to balance the exercise of this greater commercial flexibility against three other, new elements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, as a means of ensuring a steady retirement of the debt, a target date of 31 December 1998 has been set for the final repayment of the debt. Once this has been achieved, the government's debt guarantee arrangements will also end. This under <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5356"> lines the government's view that it needs to continue to withdraw from the industry to allow the industry to determine its own future direction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Second, Wool International is to be required to have sold and delivered the last bale in the stockpile by an end date of 31 December 2000. This is included to ensure that the overhang effects of the stockpile on the wool market can be removed at the earliest possible time taking account of the many other factors in the market. It is also included to ensure that Wool International, and the government's involvement in this statutory authority, can be wound up within a reasonable timeframe.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of course, there may well be an opportunity for Wool International to clear the debt and the stockpile well in advance of these legislated dates and this would be entirely consistent with the government's objectives of an early withdrawal from direct involvement in issues that are clearly matters for the industry and the market place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, Wool International's objects have been changed in two ways in order to add a new factor which the Wool International board must take into account in determining the rate of stockpile's disposal at any particular time in the future. The requirement for Wool International `to foster the "long-term" profitability and efficiency of the Australian wool industry' has been amended to remove the phrase "long-term". This reflects the increasing need, as the stockpile runs down, of Wool International to foster the short, medium and long term profitability of the industry to the greatest extent possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, Wool International is to be required, in providing for the disposal and management of the wool stockpile, and in addition to enhancing the ultimate value of the stockpile, to take account of the effect of the disposal of stockpile wool on the Australian wool market.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This requirement is repeated in Wool International's functions so as to ensure there is no doubt as to its importance in the disposal program. As a result, I expect Wool International to review its sales program and, in reaching the decisions it makes on a day&hyphen;by&hyphen;day basis on the level of sales, to be continuously addressing the issue of the impact of those sales on the wool market.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I said at the outset, this package is the culmination of a very intense and widespread consultative process. It is a clear signal that the Australian wool industry is prepared to set its own course and to determine its own destiny without relying on government for support.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a sign of the industry's increasing maturity as it forges ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to honourable Senators. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this evening to speak to the report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Causes of Death: Australia</EMPHASIS> , which was tabled yesterday and which I am sure we all would have preferred to have ignored. I guess most of us want to avoid facing and discussing the issue of death, but we will be forced to discuss it in more detail when we debate the euthanasia bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report, which was produced by the Bureau of Statistics, highlights an issue of major concern to me and it is probably one of the issues that encouraged me to come into politics. It is important that the Senate take note&mdash;and I draw this to the attention of honourable senators&mdash;of the information in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5357"> this document, which I think many of us could have easily overlooked, especially given its title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The summary of findings in the report indicated that 125,124 deaths occurred in Australia last year, which was a decrease of 1.2 per cent on the number of deaths which occurred in 1994. The area of increase which concerns me and which, as I said, has concerned me for a long time, is that where dementia is associated with death, especially in older people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dementia affects about two per cent of those in the population aged between 65 and 70 and about 20 per cent of those aged over 80. So the older we get, the more likely we are to have dementia. Deaths from dementia account for about three per cent of all deaths of those in the population aged 65 and over, but ranks as the fourth leading cause of death for those in that age range.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are no reliable data to monitor the prevalence or incidence of death from dementia. The only information comes from death registration statistics. There is a complication in that, because a person may have dementia yet die of some other disease, like pneumonia. It is really a judgment of the doctor as to whether it is dementia that is indicated or whether it is pneumonia or some other illness. Some of the deaths may be associated with dementia, but the actual death could be from a fall or a from a house burning down or something else. So the dementia could be hidden. The other factor that could contribute is that, with the increase in understanding and better psychogeriatric education of medical graduates, more people are likely to diagnose dementia, which is then more likely to appear on the death register. So there are some confounding variables in determining the number of people who die from dementia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Taking all that into account, anybody in the field would recognise that there has been an increase in the number of deaths from dementia. One of the factors contributing to that has been an increase in the number of older people. Regardless of the concerns that I have expressed about interpreting the statistics, dementia deaths among persons aged 65 and over increased from 582 in 1982 to 3,312 in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 1995. During this time, the elderly population has increased by 48 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are seeing a disproportionate increase in the number of older people. The population as a whole is increasing at a much slower rate than the population of those aged 65 and over. The number of people aged 85 and over is increasing at an accelerated rate. If anybody wants to get a feeling for this, all you have to look at is what was once called&mdash;when I was a student in economics&mdash;a population pyramid. By the year 2030, that population pyramid will in fact be a population rectangle. The projected figures for 2030 and 2050 show that the number of older people will far exceed the number of younger people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This problem will not go away unless we find out the causes of dementia and some way of curing it. Without that breakthrough in medicine this is going to be an increasing problem in the Australian community, particularly as we see an increase in the aging population. It is highlighted by the figures that are expressed in this document, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The projected increase in the elderly population is 58% between 1989 and 2011 and 173% between 1989 and 2031.</PARA>
<PARA>That shows the rapid increase in the number of people in that age group. The prevalence of dementia among persons aged 65 or more is estimated to rise by 93 per cent between 1989 and 2011 and by 234 per cent between 1989 and 2031. So by the time some of the young people working in our offices today are 75, there will have been an enormous increase in those figures. Maybe we can sit down and say, `That is in 30 years time.' If you look at the figures, as I have been whilst preparing for a paper I am giving on ageing, and at the need for an increase in nursing homes, in the next 30 years there will be a need to double the capital of nursing homes and hostels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the 10 years that I have been in parliament I have seen how little can happen. Unless we as a parliament really start thinking about this very seriously and treating it as a serious issue, we are going to leave a legacy for the next generation&mdash;many of us here in this chamber now&mdash;of people who will require residential care, which will not be <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5358"> available. It will place an enormous burden on the next generation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to overcome a legacy that has been left by Labor. The Labor Party really neglected the issue of dementia. Time after time I stood in this chamber and asked the Labor government to fund dementia specific facilities. I do not know where the breakdown was, but the policy was driven by some sort of ideology that people with dementia ought to be integrated into nursing homes because they had rights and they should not be segregated. That demonstrated to me an absolute lack of understanding of the behavioural problems that are associated with extreme dementia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some people have mild dementia, and they can be managed quite well in a facility for older people. But there are many people whose behaviour is such that it is totally unacceptable in situations of accommodation with people who are frail but not suffering from dementia. There are those people who, because of their disease, wander into other people's rooms; they interfere with their person and with their personal belongings. In one nursing home I went to a woman who was there because she had profound Parkinsonian syndrome had a metal gate across the entrance to her room because two people with profound dementia were going in and beating her over the head with rolled up newspapers. My view was that she had rights. She should not have been locked in her room, with her visitors having to unlock a gate to get in to see her.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you see a dementia specific facility which is run properly&mdash;where people suffering from dementia are able to be catered for with proper activities, where the degree of stimulation is kept low and where staff are trained to deal with some of their psychotic and abnormal behaviour&mdash;then you will appreciate that a modicum of order can be maintained. That cannot happen with the comings and goings in a normal nursing home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This afternoon I was disturbed to hear Senator Neal again put around the furphy that people will have to pay $26,000 to get into a nursing home. She knows that is wrong; she knows that is just continuing to put about a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> myth. She also said that we were not doing things for people in nursing homes. One of the things the coalition has done is to put in place a funding arrangement that takes account of the fact that a person has dementia, and that was never done by the Labor government. The message that we have had in the Australian Bureau of Statistics report yesterday is a very salutary one. It means that all of us should address this issue urgently. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<STATE> (Queensland)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(7.31 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to talk about recent events in Queensland. This is an extremely sad period in Queensland politics. In recent years, the people of Queensland have enjoyed basking in the glow of a government that was corruption free and seen to be so. Mr Borbidge and Mr Cooper have stolen this from them. They have done it solely in pursuit of their own political ambition. They are robbing Queenslanders of their right to government that is perceived to be corruption free.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the nature of Queensland political history in recent years, I am amazed that the attempt to discredit the CJC has been so blatant and arrogant. The current Queensland coalition government has displayed an appalling sense of propriety in relation to the CJC and the whole process of political and legal reform. The events of the last week have had indicated that, according to the likes of Mr Borbidge and Mr Cooper, the Fitzgerald inquiry may well have occurred in vain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an extremely frightening situation to contemplate for many Queenslanders. Years of political corruption and poor public administration have taken a very severe toll on the people of Queensland. During those dark years, living in Queensland was not beautiful one day, perfect the next. Queenslanders became the butt of many jokes because they appeared to other Australians to be oblivious to the corruption, anti-democratic practices and lack of concern for Westminster traditions&mdash;characteristics of the then coalition and National Party governments.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5359">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From the late 1960s right through to the late 1980s, people who dared to make public political comment that highlighted the deficiencies of the then Bjelke-Petersen government risked being the subject of special branch surveillance. People who ran the gauntlet of political protest during that time had their homes bugged or raided, were arrested and/or gaoled or were subject to public vilification.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of these people who suffered political oppression under the National Party government left Queensland, never to return. They moved to places where they could express their political opinions without fear of ruining their lives and their futures. It was not all that long ago that all this occurred. Living in Queensland was not okay then. It was dark, oppressive and occasionally dangerous. Queensland&mdash;beautiful one day, corrupt the next.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Madam President, once again, dark forces govern the state of Queensland. The Borbidge administration has been caught out trying to influence the outcome of the Carruthers inquiry. The Borbidge government has been breathtaking in its attempts to drag Queensland back to the future. The most spectacular example of this was the famous memorandum of understanding that the Queensland Premier, Mr Borbidge, along with the police minister, Russell Cooper, signed to get rid of the Police Commissioner and six of the senior members of the Queensland Police Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This farce commenced on 8 January of this year when a Queensland Police Union wish list was sent to Russell Cooper, who then took the list to a National Party policy committee. The now infamous MOU was created on 10 January, and by 15 January had been signed by Russell Cooper, Rob Borbidge and Gary Wilkinson. On 1 March, former Supreme Court Judge Kenneth Carruthers was appointed by the CJC to investigate allegations of electoral bribery involving the police union memorandum of understanding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At this stage, it appeared that the new coalition government was to honour their election promise to the Queensland people that it was not going to repeat the mistakes of the past. They have reneged on this promise. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> When counsel assisting the Carruthers inquiry, Cedric Hampson QC, said that a recommendation of criminal charges against Russell Cooper and others was possible, the Queensland government swung into action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By 11 October, the state government had launched an inquiry into the CJC and amended the Criminal Justice Act to compel CJC staff and commissioners to give evidence to the Connolly-Ryan inquiry. This then led to the resignation of Mr Carruthers, who had refused to be subject to this inquiry. The establishment of an inquiry that is clearly in conflict with the Carruthers inquiry can only be described as an attempt to pervert the course of justice in the state of Queensland. What we have here is an attempt not only to invalidate the Carruthers inquiry but also to effectively squash the effectiveness of the CJC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This whole debacle just gets worse. At the weekend we heard revelations of another deal to prolong the strike during the lead-up to the Mundingburra by-election to ensure a Liberal victory. We have also heard reports that Mr Cooper wanted to sack the Director-General of Corrective Services, Keith Hamburger, in exchange for prison officer support. Mr Hamburger is also on Mr Borbidge's secret hit list as a person to be sacked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also on this secret hit list are some former Commonwealth public servants who applied for jobs in the Queensland Public Service&mdash;people like the former Director&hyphen;General of the Department of Employment, Education and Vocational Training and Industrial Relations, Bob Marshman, who is condemned in the secret hit list as an active Labor supporter. Mr Marshman worked for governments of all political persuasion in Canberra. He has never been a member of any political party and was highly critical of directors&hyphen;general who showed any party preference, because he believed it compromised their ability to offer objective advice to their minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is turning back the clock to the days of cronyism in high places. It will not be long before we have a corrupt police force once again because they are trying to carve up the CJC&mdash;the body appointed to ensure that there is no corruption perpetrated <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5360"> by politicians within the Queensland Public Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other election rort they tried was the Concerned Citizens of Mundingburra Campaign&mdash;a law and order television campaign. It turned out that every member of this so&hyphen;called citizens group was a paid&hyphen;up member of the National Party&mdash;all except the poor dupe who authorised the advertisements. National Party bank accounts were used to channel funding for the TV advertising campaign, which starred none other than Russell Cooper, and were organised by Matthew Heery, who was known as Cooper's `eyes and ears'. Mr Heery has since been charged following consideration of evidence by the Carruthers inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The list of secret deals goes on and on: a police union secret memorandum; a similar deal with the Queensland Democratic Firefighters Association, an organisation established by Bruce Wilkinson, brother of Gary Wilkinson, of the Queensland Police Union. Bruce Wilkinson in no way speaks on behalf of the majority of firefighters in Queensland. He belonged to a committee that was campaigning against the Labor government in the Mundingburra by&hyphen;election. There was the prison officers deal and secret deals with the Veto Eastern Tollway Organisation and the recreational fishing group, Sunfish. It makes you wonder how many other squalid little secret deals are festering away under the surface ready to be exposed. No wonder the coalition government wants to nobble the CJC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the current behaviour of the Queensland government is all about is protecting Mr Cooper and Mr Borbidge from the risk of criminal charges to which their unprincipled and unconscionable behaviour has exposed them. In their desperation to take government at any price they have thrown the idea of political ethics in the bin. Now, they are hell&hyphen;bent on smashing any institution or inquiry that is ever likely to call them to account.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate Senator Gibbs on her <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> speech on this issue and I wish to speak on the same subject. I probably will diverge slightly from what she said, but basically I agree with the description she has given of the situation in Queensland and with that history. Any of us who lived during those years can endorse everything she said.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am concerned about the future and effectiveness of the Criminal Justice Commission in Queensland. I have spoken in the Senate quite a number of times about concerns I have had with the CJC and especially its treatment of whistleblowers. I do still retain those concerns. However, I have always tried to make it clear that those concerns do not in any way reduce my commitment, or that of the Australian Democrats, to the role of the CJC in identifying and preventing official misconduct or other improper actions of governments or their employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very concerned that the latest round of political turmoil surrounding the CJC will fatally wound the critical role for which the CJC was established. I would have thought that no&hyphen;one could forget the traumas of the Fitzgerald inquiry and the effect it had on the perceptions which Queenslanders had of politics and of the police service and the damage those perceptions do to the consensus which is necessary before any police service and any government can really be effective. The CJC was the central plank of the Fitzgerald report's attempt to remedy the faults which the inquiry uncovered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe the Democrats can assess the current Queensland situation with some impartiality. It is not very long ago that the former Labor government in Queensland was engaged in its own battle with the CJC. The message that the Democrats would like to send to all parties in Queensland&mdash;and that includes the Democrats too and the CJC&mdash;is that we should all calm down, take a cold shower and focus on the real job, which is to serve the public in a competent and incorrupt way. The whole concern exercising the minds of many people in Queensland at the moment is: are we going back to a previous era?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also say, however, that the CJC itself does have to share some of the blame for the current shambles in Queensland. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5361"> Political point scoring seems to have taken precedence over serious attempts to address the issue. One of the problems with the CJC has been its increasing involvement in criminal investigations and political debate. I believe that the CJC should leave criminal investigations to the police and the re&hyphen;establishment of an upper house in Queensland would avoid the need for the CJC to be involved in politics. Having said that, however, the real task of the CJC remains to be done. That is to prevent, investigate and prosecute corruption and official misconduct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats do not claim necessarily that the Borbidge government's judicial review is just a cynical perversion of the political process, but we are certainly concerned with the interference in the Carruthers inquiry which it seems has brought that to an abrupt end. I trust that the work done by Mr Carruthers will not be lost, but that those reports will be produced. As Senator Gibbs has said, and I agree with her, the interference in the Mundingburra by&hyphen;election was a scandal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whatever the motives of Mr Borbidge may be there are legitimate concerns with the operation of the CJC and with the sorts of roles it should be performing. The central message&mdash;and I and the rest of the Democrats would like to underline this&mdash;that we  would like to convey to all Queenslanders is: let us not forget how many people fought and how hard they fought to achieve the Fitzgerald reforms and to ensure that that report was written into the conscience of Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us not forget how important that original role of the CJC was and still is and ensure that it is not lost amid the current battles between Labor, the coalition and the CJC. That original role is still fundamental. More importantly, and finally, let us remember that we are all here to serve the public, not just to wrestle for power. Let us approach these important issues in a considered manner, understanding that it is absolutely critical for the political process in Queensland that the CJC continue and that it does the job that we believe it has been called to do.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I would like to speak about the issue of immigration. I do not want to refer to the views of Mrs Hanson on this subject but, indeed, to the views of Senator Bolkus, in particular in relation to his views about immigration in South Australia. There was an article in the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS>  on 4 November headed `Call for bigger migrant share'. It refers to the federal opposition and says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has called on the Howard Government to examine ways in which SA can reverse the shrinking of its population.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Bolkus is then quoted as saying that SA was `a dying state' which was in danger of becoming `Australia's retirement village'. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The number of migrants we receive is just too low for an ageing population like ours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We need to regenerate our population base as a matter of urgency.</PARA>
<PARA>He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This state is in very serious danger of becoming a home for the ageing. There was a time when young people headed to SA . . . now the children <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5362"> of the people who moved here in the `70s are having to move away.</PARA>
<PARA>I must say that I read that with shock and horror&mdash;that a South Australian senator could speak so disparagingly of his own state. It is an extraordinary attack on the quality and the people of his own state of South Australia. When I read that I thought, `Let us look at the facts,' because it is always very wise when Labor senators say things to just check the facts, and Senator Bolkus had said all these remarkable things about the dying state of South Australia which Senator Bolkus, of course, represents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ABS statistics that I had pulled out are based on the population growth rates for the last 10 years and projections forward as well as median age statistics for the last 10 years and projections forward&mdash;and they make very interesting reading. In fact, the population of South Australia, despite what we read from Senator Bolkus, has grown every year for the last 10 years.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="CONROY" NAMEID="3L6">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In proportion to the rest of Australia?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JX4">Senator MINCHIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Every year, the population has increased. From 1985 to 1995 the population grew by a total of 7&half; per cent or about 102,000 people, which as you would all know is about the size of a city like Townsville. So in the last 10 years South Australia has added to its population a city the size of Townsville&mdash;over 100,000 people. That, obviously, is quite contrary to the view put by Senator Bolkus that the state is shrinking.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The population of South Australia is projected by the ABS to continue to grow well into the next century, at least until the year 2036; and the projected population increase over that period of 40 years&mdash;which is within our lifetime, Senator Conroy, I trust&mdash;will be 12 per cent or about 170,000. So over the next 40 years it is projected by the ABS that we will add to the population of South Australia a city the size of Hobart. Yet we have a senator for South Australia, Senator Bolkus, telling us the place is shrinking and dying. It is obviously not dying; the population is going to grow for at least another 40 years and then it will probably stabilise at around <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> nearly 1.7 million. I would have to say to Senator Bolkus, who obviously does not spend a lot of time in South Australia, that we are talking about the driest state in the driest continent&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="CONROY" NAMEID="3L6">

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3L6">Senator Conroy</NAME></TALKER>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JX4">Senator MINCHIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A state which, it would not be known to Senator Conroy, is totally dependent on the Murray River, a river system which other states are doing their best to pollute and a river system which clearly is in a lot of trouble. That is one of the reasons we want to sell one&hyphen;third of Telstra, in order that we can find the money to clean up the Murray River so that the state of South Australia can get clean water.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would have to be said that it is doubtful that South Australia in its current situation and its total dependence on the Murray River for the most important thing that any population needs&mdash;water&mdash;can sustain a population much bigger than that projected for the year 2036. But Senator Bolkus also went on to say, as I quoted before, that SA is in serious danger of becoming Australia's retirement village. Presumably he means we are all getting decrepit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He might be speaking about the Labor Party in South Australia; it is very decrepit, I can tell you. But, again, let us go to the facts. The median age in South Australia in 1995 was 35.1 years of age. I am very close to that median age but let us look at the median age in Australia as a whole. That was 33.7. So this ageing decrepit state has a median age of only a bit over one year more than the national average. I see Senator Conroy pointing to himself. He is presumably the median age of South Australia. Congratulations, Senator!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The future projections for South Australia, based on ABS figures, show that: for example, in 2006 the median age will be 38.5 compared with 36.6 for the nation as a whole; in 2026 the median age will be 42.8 for South Australia and 40.6 for the nation as a whole; and in 2046, which is the extent of their projections, the median age in South Australia will be 45 and 42.5 for the nation as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So even way out into the year 2046, another 50 years from now, the median age in South <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5363"> Australia will only be 2&half; years greater than the median age for the population as a whole. Yet we have Senator Bolkus disparaging his state of South Australia, of which you and I, Madam President, are very proud, saying it is a retirement village, we are all dying and it is the nursing home for Australia. Obviously his assertions are utterly ridiculous and without foundation, as are many of his assertions in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ageing of the population, as those figures demonstrate, is a national phenomenon. It is not something peculiar to the state of South Australia. I am sure Victoria and other states are experiencing the same ageing of their populations. Presumably Senator Bolkus is saying that we have to do something dramatic to halt this increase in the median age. However, it would require a massive change in the demography of not only Australia but also South Australia to change that in any significant way, certainly to halt it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There would have to be a massive increase in the birthrate of South Australians, which I am doing my best to help, and an incredibly huge influx of very young migrants to make any difference to the gradual increase in the median age. A huge increase in the birthrate or in the number of young migrants is not realistic and probably not sensible in South Australia, or indeed sustainable. As I have often said, what this country really needs and what Senator Bolkus should turn his mind to is a population policy. Senator Bolkus would do himself a lot of good by paying attention to what his own national president, Barry Jones, has said on this subject many times and to the very good report which Mr Jones brought out a couple of years ago, which our government will be responding to in due course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We really all should approach immigration, the appropriate growth rates for our various states and the median age of the nation from the point of view of the appropriate population for the country. How many migrants we have should be seen in that context. I am personally of the view that a stabilisation of our population at around the 23 million mark, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which is projected to occur in around 2036, would be a very sensible outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by quoting a very interesting letter I saw in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> today from Dr Phillip Law, AC, CBE, where he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pauline Hanson has poisoned the immigration debate.&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and I think we would all agree with that&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be about a sustainable society, not about the ethnic composition of that society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Immigration needs to be reduced (whether comprising British, Italian, Greece, Turkish, African, Indian or East Asian immigrants) to a level that this country can absorb without deleterious effects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A recent symposium of the Australian Academy of Science on Australia's population examined economic, demographic, environmental, agricultural, urban, defence and social aspects of population increase and concluded that an ultimate population of around 23 million should be the objective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have a remarkably high "quality of life" in Australia. It is the result of great space and a small population. Don't let us destroy it.</PARA>
<PARA>We should all heed those words. We should all examine this question of the population and immigration sensibly on the basis of environmental, economic and social factors. We should approach it in a much more constructive fashion than Senator Bolkus in relation to his home state of South Australia.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the adjournment tonight about Canberra. An interesting theme has emerged in the adjournment debate tonight where a number of speakers have said there seems to be a correlation between the coalition government and policies that take them back into the past. That is exactly what I want to talk about tonight with respect to Canberra.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously this government is anti&hyphen;public sector. We have seen the job cuts that have impacted here on the public sector and flowed through to job cuts in the private sector. We have also seen the economic and symbolic impact of this government's policies on our whole mind&hyphen;set here and on the general attitude of the Australian population towards Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5364">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government seems to think that Canberra deserves some rough handling and that somehow that will score them points out in the rest of Australia. But, as usual, this government ignores the people factor in their economic equations. They are ignoring the fact that Canberra is not just the nation's capital, it is also the home of 300,000 people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have raised these issues with government ministers, written letters and lobbied through the media but as yet the government has given no indication that it is listening to the needs of the people here. The more local residents I speak to the more I know that this is a community concern and that a community response is required from this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tonight I announce here in the Senate that I will be distributing a petition to present back to the Senate. The petition will assist in bringing pressure to bear on this government to take some steps to rectify the devastating social and economic effects its policies are having on Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Canberrans are very proud to live in the Australian capital. But this is also our home. Canberra needs a future both as a capital city and as a community. This government must recognise this dual role and take action by stating their commitment to the capital and funding local initiatives to help get Canberra through this very difficult period. Unless Canberra's 300,000&hyphen;plus residents are respected in this way and unless Canberra's role as the national capital is acknowledged and promoted with pride by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), then this government will be letting down the whole of Australia.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Science and Technology has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The satellite launching facility at Gunn Point in the Northern Territory is being proposed by Space Transportation Systems (STS) Ltd, with United Communications Public Company Ltd (Thailand) as its major partner. The Commonwealth Government is not involved in any commercial negotiations regarding the project but is involved in the facilitation and regulatory process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proponents are currently completing a detailed feasibility study including an environmental impact assessment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism has granted the project `Major Projects Facilitation (MPF) Status'. The MPF service provides STS with support from the Department of Industry, Science and Tourism (DIST) in identifying the project approvals required, and coordinating the activities of the various approval agencies so that decisions can be made within commercial timeframes. The Minister has conveyed this support to some parties involved in commercial negotiations with STS, to indicate that the Government is working with STS to ensure the necessary approvals are sought and processes complied with, in a timetable acceptable to a commercial venture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Due to the commercial nature of the project, much of the information currently held by the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Commonwealth is `commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence' and therefore cannot be tabled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Commonwealth Government approvals which are required for the Gunn Point project to proceed are:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Foreign Investment through the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> environment approvals, as required by the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> satellite launch licenses&mdash;this legislation is currently being developed and is anticipated to be introduced to Parliament in the Autumn 1997 sittings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) There are no planned or potential defence applications for the facility beyond what would be the case with a commercial seaport or airport. If the Commonwealth Department of Defence is interested in being a customer for launch services, it is up to it, as it would be with any potential commercial or government customer, to negotiate an arrangement with the service provider.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) There are no present or anticipated future issues of national security regarding the proposed facility any more than there would be in the context of a commercial seaport or airport. Launch licensing, which will be required for commercial launches, will take into account national security considerations. This will include the right to veto payloads which may infringe Australian defence interests, Australian law, or international agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) As outlined in the answer to questions (1) and (3) above, the Commonwealth's role in the project is both facilitative and regulatory. It has no financial interest in the facility. The project may be eligible for existing generic industry development grants and concessions (eg., tariff concessions), but at this stage none have been applied for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ongoing administrative responsibilities of the Commonwealth will be the licensing and monitoring of the satellite launching facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth Government's Investment Promotion and Facilitation Program contributed $50,000 to a pre&hyphen;feasibility study for the project in 1995. Funding was also provided by the Queensland and Northern Territory Governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) As a wholly commercial venture, there would be no Commonwealth Government liability in the event of project failure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(8) In areas where the Commonwealth has an interest, the operation of the facility will be monitored through legislation providing a regulatory framework for space activities in and from Australia. This legislation will cover environmental protection and health and safety issues that are not already in other Commonwealth legislation. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5366"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(9) The space activities legislation will cover issues of Commonwealth involvement and liability (resulting from obligations to UN Space Treaties) in the event of an accident or as a result of a launch facility's activities.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Dr Habibie raised in our meeting on 17 September 1996 Indonesia's plans to construct a hydro&hyphen;electric dam in the Mamberamo region. Dr Habibie said he saw a role for Australia in the project in relation to irrigation from the dam and proposed that Australia and Indonesia collaborate to develop irrigation in Irian Jaya. Dr Habibie also mentioned his plan for the development of Eastern Indonesia, but did not mention any other specific projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The science and technology portfolio has had primary carriage of cooperation with the Indonesian government on development of the Mamberamo region under the Collaboration on Science and Technology Australia&hyphen;Indonesia (COSTAI) arrangement. The following was provided by the minister for science and technology, the Hon Peter McGauran, MP, regarding information which his department and portfolio agencies have about the Mamberamo River project:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Mamberamo River project is a major development proposal, initiated by Indonesia's Research and Technology Minister Dr B J Habibie. The concept includes development of the region's agricultural and mineral resources, the damming of the Mamberamo River and the development of a 15000 Megawatt hydro&hyphen;electric power plant to attract a wide range of industrial activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">During 1993&hyphen;1995 the CSIRO, in collaboration with the Indonesian Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology, was involved in a preliminary study of sustainable development of the Mamberamo region.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report of the Phase 1 study recommended a comprehensive and integrated approach to the development of the region, including the conservation of biodiversity and proposed a Phase 2 study which would produce an environmental and resources management plan, covering nature conservation, agriculture, forestry, industrial and other development and social issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed Phase 2 study has not progressed because funding (estimated at US $5 million) has not been obtained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Geological Survey Organisation has not been actively involved in the development of the project to date.
