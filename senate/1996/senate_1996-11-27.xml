<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this Bill is to make a number of small but important amendments to the Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1992 (the SRC Act) and to the Occupational Health and Safety (Maritime Industry) Act 1993 (the OH&amp;S(MI) Act).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments to the two Acts flow from recommendations by the tripartite Seafarers Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Authority (the Seacare Authority) aimed at improving the administration of the workers compensation and occupational health and safety schemes, mainly by addressing a number of inconsistencies and anomalies in the current legislation. In developing its recommendations, the Seacare Authority consulted extensively with Australian ship operators, the insurers underwriting seafarers compensation liabilities and the maritime unions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule 1 of the Bill amends the SRC Act. While there are a large number of amendments, the fundamentals of the seafarers compensation scheme will remain unchanged. There is, for example, no change proposed to entitlements or levels of benefits available to injured seafarers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While acknowledging the hazardous work environment of many seafarers, the Government is none the less seriously concerned at the Seacare Authority's 1995-96 annual report statistics which show a worsening claim rate and continuing high levels of longer term injuries, particularly among Maritime Union of Australia members. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6077"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the undertakings of the MUA under the 1994 Maritime Industry Restructuring Agreement was to cooperate with employers in stamping out compensation rorts. No such cooperation has been forthcoming. Furthermore, after more than 18 months of negotiations, the MUA has yet to implement a memorandum of agreement developed with employers on an effective shipboard rehabilitation policy to assist the reintegration of injured workers back into the workforce. This results in a very significant cost burden to Australian ship operators as reflected in their insurance premiums for workers' compensation. It is a matter which the Government will keep in mind while pursuing wider reforms in the shipping industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are three amendments to the SRC Act which your attention is drawn. The first of these is the proposed new section 20A at item 14 of Schedule 1. That section will allow the Seacare Authority to exempt employment of specified employees on a particular ship from the application of the SRC Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will mainly have application where a ship, which normally operates within the confines of a single State or Territory, is required to make a one-off interstate or overseas delivery voyage. Currently, such a ship would be covered by the SRC Act for that voyage and thus be required to have appropriate insurance cover, notwithstanding its crew would already be covered by the relevant State or Territory compensation scheme, and the employer would be paying premiums under that scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Seacare Authority has received numerous complaints that this short term cover is difficult, and often impossible, to obtain and is prohibitively costly. The insurance companies also acknowledge this type of cover is, in many instances, not a normally acceptable commercial risk.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Seacare Authority will determine appropriate conditions to apply before an exemption is granted, such as pre-existing coverage by a State scheme, and will prepare guidelines to advise ship operators of these conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second matter to which I draw your attention is at item 75 of Schedule 1. Section 93 is amended to provide that insurance policies under the SRC Act are not subject to State or Territory stamp duty. This is to bring the seafarers compensation scheme into line with State and Territory compensation schemes. No State or Territory imposes stamp duty on workers' compensation policies taken out under their own legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thirdly, I draw your attention to item 96 of Schedule 1 which inserts a new section 139A into the SRC Act. That new section will exclude the operation of State and Territory workers' compensation laws where the SRC Act applies. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effect of the new section will be to prevent forum shopping. That is where an injured seafarer shops around the various compensation schemes to find the scheme which pays the best benefits. Forum shopping has occurred mainly in respect of hearing loss because some States will pay compensation for a lower level of hearing loss than that set out under the SRC Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, by virtue of new section 139A, a State or Territory will not be able to require a ship owner to pay State workers' compensation premiums where the SRC Act applies. Currently, there is nothing to prevent this. The Seacare Authority is aware of instances of a ship operator being required to pay premiums for workers compensation insurance under both the SRC Act and a State workers' compensation scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of the bill be adjourned until the first sitting day in 1997, in accordance with the order agreed to on 29 november 1994.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the order of the Senate of 29 November 1994, relating to the consideration of legislation, not apply to the Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a bill which is of considerable importance for a number of reasons. It is of importance to the budget bottom line. Over four years, this will make a difference of some <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6080"> $500 million. Perhaps more importantly, it actually reflects on the quality of care offered to patients in Australia. It reflects upon the ability of doctors to practice without appropriate experience in fields in which they have not been trained or had further experience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill is supported by the deans of the medical schools. It is a bill which&mdash;contrary to the submissions of the Australian Labor Party in a Senate report tabled yesterday&mdash;will not result in doctors being out of work. There are positions for many of these doctors. Virtually all of them will be able to find appropriate positions. It just means that it will not be an open-ended slather, which is what it was under the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party recognised the problem but essentially did not have the guts to do anything about it. It was a disgrace that they produced such a biased minority report without actually looking at the facts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might add in passing that, although we did not agree with the Australian Democrats's report&mdash;certain aspects of it were indeed well reasoned; we are happy to discuss and debate some of the issues they raised&mdash;it was based upon some facts. We think those facts are not necessarily accurate, but, on the contrary, the Labor Party report was simply a political job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So this is an important bill. It is important for the quality of medicine. It is important for the budget bottom line. We look forward to debating this bill, and we believe that this should therefore have priority.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition is opposed to exempting the Health Insurance Amendment Bill No. 2 from the cut-off. There seems to be developing on the government side of this chamber a general view that, whenever they are sufficiently disorganised to comply with the cut-off rule, they will automatically receive an exemption. In fact, an exemption should be applied only where there are special circumstances that justify it. There has been a general acceptance that, where a bill is a budget bill, it should be exempted. But in this case this is not a budget bill, and that principle does not apply.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at this bill, you will see that there are good arguments to say that the general rule that requires a period of time to elapse between the introduction of a bill and it being debated well applies, in that it has fairly substantial effects on one group in the community&mdash;medical students, interns and trainee doctors. It also has a substantial effect on a large part of the community, that is, those people who make use of health services in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill has been rushed in. Senator Woods tried to tell me that as a result of this bill the community will get a better health service, but that, sadly, is not the case. As our report pointed out, this bill was intended to deal with the maldistribution of health services across Australia. There has been an acceptance across both sides of the chamber that for some period of time there has been an oversupply of doctors. This has been accepted notwithstanding the fact that the department of health is unable to show any direct causal connection between the increase in Medicare usage per capita and the increase in the number of doctors. But it seems to be the case, and the opposition accepts&mdash;it was the view of the Labor Party while in government&mdash;that there is a direct connection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The difficulty with this solution is that the maldistribution between rural areas and metropolitan areas is not resolved by this bill. In fact, there was a clear indication by a large number of people who put submissions to the Senate community affairs committee, and it was also the view of a number of state representatives, that this situation will make the supply of doctors in rural areas much worse. There was a statement made by the Premier of Western Australia just this week which indicated exactly that view. The fact is that this move will continue to lessen the supply of rural doctors, both in general practice and in hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was accepted by a large number of people who made submissions to the committee that many doctors, between the period when they do their year of internship and when they may go into general practice, often will go out into country areas&mdash;</PARA>

She will get plenty of chances later on to debate the issues and matters contained in the bill. What we are discussing and debating now is whether there should be an exemption from the cut&hyphen;off. This is a question of whether it should be, if you like, accorded urgency. The reasons why it should be accorded urgency are what you should be addressing, not the substance of the bill.

No senator can mount that case without, obviously, touching on the substantive issues involved and the urgency of dealing with them. Although it is unusual in the life of this parliament, because the opposition has been very generous, as opposed to what the coalition did when they were in opposition in relation to exemptions from the cut&hyphen;off motion, I think you would find that the precedent has been well established, Mr Acting Deputy President, that the sorts of remarks that Senator Neal is making in support of her case are absolutely in order.

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="B36">Senator NEAL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you for your ruling, Mr Acting Deputy President. Essentially, there is no reason to rush this bill through, on the basis that it does not substantially deal with the problem that it set out to deal with. In fact, it may well worsen the position. It also has some unfortunate consequences for the group of people I mentioned earlier&mdash;that is, medical students, people who have already started their course, interns and doctors in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> training. This group of people, in good faith, started their course&mdash;a long period of training, generally up to eight years&mdash;on the assumption that when they completed that training, without having done any extra general practitioner training of two to three years, they would be able to receive a Medicare provider number and practise in the general community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill substantially changes that. It changes it when they have already started their course and when they have made plans based on the circumstances that existed when they entered university. In particular, this makes the bill unfair and inequitable. It was also pointed out to us in evidence provided by the department of health that the bill is to take effect on 1 November, even though it may not be passed until some time later. Accordingly, their view is that anyone who receives a Medicare provider number post 1 November this year, when the bill comes into effect, will be retrospectively affected and that Medicare number will be taken off them. I think that is a rather extraordinary, unfair and harsh result for those people who have found themselves in those circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am a bit surprised at Senator Woods. I would have thought that, because he is a practising doctor, he would have had some sympathy for the plight of those medical students. You would know very well the amount of commitment required and the careful planning of their careers that is needed in order to comply with all the requirements of practising as a doctor. I must confess that it disappoints me that he is so unsympathetic towards that group of people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition is concerned about the way in which this bill is being rushed through, the failure to properly consider the bill and to deal with all those people who have an interest in the area. It has not been properly considered. In fact, in their wish to rush this bill through, the government refused to allow the bill to be referred to a committee by the House of Representatives and therefore to have it considered there. Although we did have the benefit of an inquiry through the Senate community affairs committee, that was for less than one month. I do not believe&mdash; <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6082">and I think a lot of people in the community do not believe&mdash;that it was an adequate amount of time to deal with the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last issue in the sorry tale of the procedural unfairness and inadequacy of the way this bill has been dealt with is the fact that the AMA&mdash;I am sure Senator Woods is a member of that organisation&mdash;is a body that you would think is very much involved in the process of how doctors are trained and the requirements set out for Medicare provider numbers. That organisation was even denied the right to appear before the community affairs committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the fact that, traditionally, there has not been a great accord between the doctors union and the opposition, certainly, in these circumstances of having been dealt with unfairly, as they were, we strongly supported their right to speak. But it represents the way that this government believes that legislation which adversely affects members of the community can be rushed through and that they do not need to have proper regard for the issues of fairness and consultation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to be able to continue some remarks in relation to the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 1996. I confess that my brief contribution yesterday evening was made somewhat out of anger in response to the comments made by the Australian Democrats' spokeswoman on the matter. This morning I engage in the debate more with a degree of sorrow after having had the opportunity to read <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  and see exactly what was said by the Democrats. Allow me to quote from yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  to put some of my comments into context. The Australian Democrats' spokeswoman told us:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Apart from a government ideologically bound to private education, who else came forward to support this bill? The Coordinating Committee of Jewish Day Schools said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We would believe that any group in the community who wishes to operate a school and to meet appropriate criteria, should be permitted to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This was the general tenor of submissions by the Australian Association of Christian Schools, the Anglican Schools Commission, the Christian parent controlled schools and the Lutheran schools.</PARA>
<PARA>We were then later told in the debate&mdash;and these comments were addressed to government senators, I assume, as well as to other senators:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">If you want to go down in history as being part of a government which places the interests of small, fundamentalist and extreme schools at the expense of Australia's public schooling system, then by all means vote for this bill.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, we had some very divisive&mdash;nearly spiteful&mdash;language towards, and stereotyping and vilifying of, the Jewish day schools, Christian parent controlled schools, Anglican schools and Lutheran schools.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I went for my walk this morning I could not help but think how would the parents react as they were dropping their children off at school, and how would the children themselves feel being dropped off at those schools&mdash;thousands of schools around the country&mdash;knowing there are people in this place willing to describe Jewish day schools and Christian parent controlled schools as extreme and fundamentalist? Of course, we were never told what was meant by the term `extreme'. It was just a throw away line, a put&hyphen;down, of those types of schools. But I wonder what sort of reaction would those people have. How would they feel?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you listened to the Democrat contribution, we were asked somewhat rhetorically whether this bill would reopen the divisive state aid debate. I ask rhetorically: who is being divisive by describing Jewish day schools and Christian parent controlled schools, Anglican schools and Lutheran schools as being extreme and fundamentalist? Who is the one being divisive?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After that pejorative and hurtful description, Senator Allison has the audacity to walk away from the consequences of her comments with all the finesse of Pontius Pilate and say, `Any of the consequences do not visit upon me.' But those words were spoken by her and she is the one who I submit is being very divisive in this debate. I wonder what she meant by `extreme'. What did she mean by being fundamentalist? Is it that they start school with prayer of a morning because they honour God in what they do? If that is what you mean, have you ever thought that this parliament starts every morning with a prayer and has done so for 95 years? Does that somehow make this Senate extremist, fundamentalist, not representative of the Australian community?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would really urge the Democrats and other honourable senators to give serious consideration to the sort of division that will be occasioned in the Australian community if this bill is not passed. If it is not passed, it will be seen as being defeated on the basis of the sort of pejorative language and put&hyphen;downs employed by the Democrats spokeswoman. I just remind this Senate that it was only some <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6084"> 27 days ago that we unanimously passed in this place a motion which, in part, read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) reaffirms:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> its commitment to the right of all Australians to enjoy equal rights and be treated with equal respect regardless of . . . creed</PARA>
<PARA>I have left a few other words like race, colour and origin out. What do you think the Jewish day school parents and the Christian parents feel who want to be treated with equal rights and equal respect? Do you know what the Democrat contribution to that motion said? This was submitted by their leader, Senator Kernot:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am reminded that, in 1977, the Democrats were founded on the slogan of tolerance . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I ask you: Jewish day schools extreme, Christian parent controlled schools extreme, Anglican schools extreme, Lutheran schools extreme? That is the language of tolerance courtesy of the Australian Democrats. That is the sort of language that they always mouth but when it comes down to the nitty gritty they can be as vilifying as any of the worst elements in our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just found that contribution by the Australian Democrats very sad because I think it causes deep hurt. Allow me to quote Senator Kernot again from that speech. Those comments that were made yesterday have caused `deep hurt and offence that has been given to many decent Australians who are simply going about their business of living and making their own contribution to this nation'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are really debating with this legislation is whether or not people who have the right to establish a school, who have all the necessary state criteria to establish a school, are then entitled to some degree of funding. What we have here in this debate is double taxation. These people have made a contribution to the tax system for the free education in the state system. I have no concerns about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is fine and that is the way it ought to be. But each time a parent makes a decision to send their child to a private school they save the Australian taxpayer about $2,000 per annum. Just keep in mind that if there were <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> no private schools in this country the burden on the Australian taxpayer would be huge. Some have estimated it would require about another $1 billion from our taxes to fund the education system if there were not the private school sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said yesterday evening, rich people do not mind this new schools policy. It does not impact upon them. They have the money anyway. It impacts upon those smaller groups within the community and those groups that do not necessarily have sufficient funds to fund the totality of their child's education on a private basis. So all we are doing as a government is sticking by one of our election promises, a very up-front election promise, that we would abolish the new schools policy because we thought it was discriminatory, that it was unfair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Basically, we are told by the Democrats and those opposite that we ought to celebrate diversity, that we ought to celebrate differing views but not if you happen to be Jewish or Christian or Anglican or Lutheran. They say that we should not fund those elements within the community because they are extreme. But we are never given an explanation as to what extreme actually means in those circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will give the opportunity to ensure proper funding to numerous community groups and parents right around this country to get a fair deal from the education system. Why is it that somehow the state government is allowed to run a school that only has 40 pupils or 27 pupils? When I mention those figures I think of specific examples in my home state of Tasmania. Yet if a Christian group or another group wanted to set up a school with just 40 pupils or 27 pupils under the current Labor policy they would be denied funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us keep in mind, when people say that this funding for the private schools will somehow be at the cost of public schools, that the reality is that over the next four years funding from Commonwealth government sources is estimated to increase funding per student in a government school by 17.9 per cent and for a student in a non&hyphen;government school by only 14.92 per cent. In other words, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6085"> there will be a lesser increase for private school students than there will be for the public sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a huge number of provisions in this legislation that will allow for a fairer and more competitive system. To those who support the state system, I say, `Good on you, I support it as well.' I went right through the state school system for my education and I think that it was a pretty good system. I do not mind the thought of competition and of parents being given a real choice and not being told, `Your taxes can pay for the public sector but, if you want to send your child to a private school that happens to have a few lower numbers, we will deny funding to that school.' I think that is unfair. It is grossly unfair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can see that there will a contribution from Senator O'Brien, a senator from Tasmania, later on. He might like to give some thought to the Kingston Christian Community School, for example, that does not get any funding for its secondary school. It has the numbers in the primary school, so it gets Commonwealth funding. It is slightly short in its secondary school, so it does not get Commonwealth funding, but kids have gone, and will continue to go, through that school at great sacrifice to their parents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator O'Brien might like to give some thought to the Circular Head Christian parent&hyphen;controlled school, which is still battling to get federal government funding. The reason it is denied funding is not&mdash;as Senator Allison would suggest&mdash;that it is extreme or fundamentalist, or some other reason. The only reason is that it falls short of the threshold of numbers. If a state government is entitled to run a school with Commonwealth assistance with only 40 pupils, why should a private school not be given the same sort of funding?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In short, the question has to be asked: what message will be sent out to the Australian community if this bill is defeated? Everybody will read the commentary, especially from the Australian Democrats, and they will say that there is a view in this parliament that if you are a Jewish day school you are extreme, if you are Lutheran school you are extreme and you be can be discounted and we do not have <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to worry about you at all, unless you have a huge number. Of course, the more numbers there are, the more wealth there is. Is that fair? Is that really looking after the people who need the assistance?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very pleased to be associated with this bill. It is my genuine hope for those hundreds, indeed thousands, of parents right around this country who are making huge personal sacrifices that this bill gets through&mdash;for their benefit and the benefit of their children.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first major change in this States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill involves the broadbanding of 40 targeted assistance programs into five programs. They are literacy, languages, special language needs, school to work and quality outcomes. This allows the minister to transfer money between all of them. Broadbanding, from my experience, is a tool to merge programs and cut the total amounts available. The message we are getting from the community is that these impacts are minimal. However, it does not preclude the government from making cuts in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All the programs to be merged under the five areas are relevant to those outcomes. For instance, the disadvantaged schools program, or DSP, the English language program, or ELP, and English as a second language, or ESL, all have literacy outcomes. The crunch issue is that equity programs have different goals from the targeted programs and, therefore, these should not merged. However, it appears that there is not the political opposition to support this move.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second issue involves the abolition of the new schools policy, which instituted planning for non&hyphen;government schools. Most of the current new schools policy is in guidelines, but there are also some fundamental legislative changes to which we are opposed. I understand that the opposition is moving amendments and the Greens are inclined to support them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new schools policy has been in place since 1986 and has provided a framework within which non&hyphen;government schools receive Commonwealth funding. In a non&hyphen;government <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6086"> school application for funding, an assessment is done on the likely impact of that proposed school on existing schools. The NSP is to be abolished in this legislation and the only criterion for Commonwealth funding for a new non&hyphen;government school will be state registration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cost to the government of wiping out the NSP has been estimated at $150 million in new non&hyphen;government schools over four years. This does not include the loss of closing government schools. This $150 million could be spent on the problems facing government schools in terms of professional development for teachers&mdash;funnily enough, some of that has just been cut&mdash;and the enormous capital and teaching resources needed to upgrade information technology in schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An analysis of the impact of the NSP's removal shows a minimum of 65 new non&hyphen;government schools starting up which would serve about 33,250 students. If the government gets away with removing the maximum funding available, which I understand is reinserted in the ALP amendments and which the Greens are inclined to support, more non&hyphen;government schools will get extra funding. This will increase costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the non-government sector will cost more, at the same time, recurrent funding to government schools will be cut by 23 per cent and non-government schools will receive an increase in funding of 12.5 per cent. The shift from government to non-government schools is being encouraged by the government. It is interesting that the research shows that, for parents, the main variable for choosing a non-government school over a government one is the better teacher-student ratio. Therefore as the government continues to run down teaching standards, capital, infrastructure and the number of teachers in schools, the government's policy will become self-fulfilling prophesies. Instead of the rhetoric of rewarding choice, the government will be rewarding entrenched privilege in the schools system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps we will get to the stage of having vouchers, which Milton Friedman used to push in the United States. It is getting close to the system that exists in the United States, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> where you take a voucher to a private school or a government school and that is the limit of government funding. We do not want to see that&mdash;it would not be a fair and equitable system for Australia&mdash;but I am very much afraid that that is what we are moving towards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Without a new schools policy, there will be a proliferation of small non-government schools. As we are seeing in Western Australia, some public schools may be forced to close, which will deny access to disadvantaged students in some geographical areas. The funding differences between private and public schools will be exacerbated by the funding transfer. The gap between rich and poor schools will widen, especially in areas of computer technology. We are already seeing private school students with a laptop computer each while public school students cannot even access a personal computer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The abolition of the new schools policy is ideologically driven and wrapped up in the rhetoric of choice and competition. It is, however, silent on the sacrifice being made in this policy shift towards equity and universal access. Removing monitoring, planning and accountability with the abolition of the new schools policy means that state registration will be the only hurdle for a non-government school to start up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The existing policies that set standards for new schools are highly inconsistent and vary state by state. For example, only six out of our eight states and territories do not have minimum enrolment requirements for non-government schools. There are also inconsistencies in exactly what state policies will be used when they conflict themselves. In Victoria, the requirements are 20 students for a non-government primary school and 10 students for a non-government secondary school. Yet, once the Kennett government was elected, it used the quality provision framework, which specifies 500 students for non-government secondary schools. New primary and secondary schools in growth corridors can only start up with enrolments of 450 and 1,100 students respectively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I want to mention one last point about the new schools policy which shows the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6087"> government's ability to jeopardise school projects due to implementing their policy decisions before they are even legislated. My office has received a call from the Emmaus Primary School here in Canberra, which has been encouraged and facilitated by the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs and the office of the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) to go ahead with their school plans as if the new schools policy was not in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is possible that the non-government parties will band together to ensure that the new schools policy is reinstated. This would mean that schools, such as this one, that have taken out leases, hired teachers and enrolled students may not be able to go ahead. In this instance, I understand that this school will meet most of the new schools policy guidelines. However, how many other schools has the government encouraged to set up under a scenario of no checks and balances for school establishment? How many more schools will be caught in the crossfire of the government's incompetence in pushing ahead with policy implementation without legislative backing? This school I refer to sees the importance of the retention of the new schools policy and is not anti-NSP. The government must bring in transitional arrangements for dealing with schools that have taken on financial commitments through undertakings from the government that the lifting of the NSP was a sure thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third major change in this bill amends the funding arrangements to enable transfers of money from the government to the non-government schools sector. The new system of funding will rapidly increase enrolments in non-government schools. This expansion will be funded from cuts in expenditure on government schools. The major offset will be obtained by cutting $1,712 per student head from the government schools recurrent grants program every time a student enrols in a non-government school. The offset is called the enrolment benchmark adjustment in the budget. Through this, about $128 million will be transferred from the government sector to non-government schools. A further $406 per <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> student will be saved by the government for every new student not funded in the public schools sector, which provides a further $30 million saving for the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cuts are driven by the Commonwealth thinking that it is not getting a good deal from the states on education spending efficiency. The difference between putting a student through the government sector compared with the non-government sector is an extra $3,400. That is how the government chose to take $1,712 away from each student who moves to the non-government sector. The impact will be more profound than the $1,712 per student head, however. This is because schools cannot make savings per head to administration, infrastructure and teaching costs based on a figure of a student moving across to the non-government sector. That is the difference between the marginal costs and the average costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These costs to the government schools sector do not stand alone. In June 1996, the Howard government cut untied grants to the states by $1.5 billion over three years. It claimed that it would not affect education spending. However, the states spend 25 per cent of their grants on education. This cut translates into at least a cut of $400 million from education spending.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Above all, the government have made a strategic decision to cut their costs by pushing people into the non-government sector through the relaxation of the new schools policy, which is far cheaper to them. They have avoided looking at the bigger picture, which is that Australia's education spending compared with the other OECD nations is at its lowest levels. The real policy problem is how to increase this spending. However, the federal government has misdirected its efforts by targeting state expenditure as a problem as well as having its own goals of reducing financial responsibility for education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As an aside, part of that problem is insufficient attention to the revenue base. It is well over time that we started looking at a decent revenue base for those things which people know and expect their taxpayer dollars to be spent on. They include decent and equitable education, a decent and equitable health <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6088"> system and decent spending to protect the environment now and into the future. There are also the other issues in which government is expected to play a positive role in the community and provide a fair go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, the Greens support the principle of universal access to free government schools. Unplanned provision of non-government schools will potentially destroy the public school sector and leave non-government schools as the only option in some areas. The Greens support planned provision of schools so that government resources are not wasted, and universal access to public schools. We do not support the transfer of moneys away from the government sector to the non-government sector. We also agree with the calls from lobby groups for an ombudsman or ombudsperson or independent review mechanism to ensure that communities can voice their concerns about the proposed changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that the amendment which is being proposed by Senator Allison is an improvement. Certainly if the bill is to be dealt with properly, we need that time to consider it and to delay committee consideration of the bill until proper independent research has been done. That is certainly a step up from the current situation. Therefore, I indicate that I will be supporting Senator Allison's amendment at the second reading.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think a lot of senators will be asking why the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 1996 is so important. I trust that senators are asking that question and I ask them to give very serious thought to the answer. This is a bill that involves the expenditure of some $14 billion. This is a bill that represents a major shift in the arrangements between the Commonwealth and the states with respect to the funding of education. It heralds the very first moves that this government is making in terms of abrogation of its key responsibilities for ensuring an equitable and high quality schooling system within this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the better part of a generation Commonwealth governments of all parties have assumed, for very good reasons, an important <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> leadership role in promoting and advancing the curriculum for Australian schools, for teaching in Australian schools and for infrastructure in Australian schools. They have done that both for the government sector and the non-government sector. Governments of both political persuasions, but especially the Labor government, have presided over a continuing and unprecedented rise in the number of students actually staying on at school.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen quite dramatic improvements in retention rates. We have seen quite extraordinary moves in the development of national goals for schooling and we have seen dramatic and very worthwhile developments in terms of professional development opportunities for teachers. In fact, the Commonwealth has funded the majority of professional development for a number of states in this Commonwealth. In recent years in Victoria the overwhelming bulk of funding for professional development came out of Commonwealth government sources. Probably as a result of these various policies, they have produced the most equitable schooling system that this country has ever seen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of this is put at risk by this government's action in this bill. This is simply because this government is unwilling to bear its responsibilities for the promotion of the national interest. This is particularly important in this area where we see that there is a universal understanding outside of this government of the importance of education in ensuring this country's future, particularly this country's future prosperity. Education and training is understood to provide the single most important long-term leverage point that is available for all levels of government for improving the quality of life and the general prosperity of this country. It is an essential priority of government for economic reasons but also for social reasons, particularly if you are actually interested in ensuring the promotion of a just society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Contrary to the election promises and with no effective consultation with the Australian people or, for that matter, state governments&mdash;I say that given that I am a longstanding critic of the way in which state governments have undermined education in this <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6089"> country&mdash;this government has clearly ignored governments, even of their own persuasion. Universally they have said&mdash;not quite universally; all except Victoria&mdash;that these proposals are wrong and that these are the most radical shifts in Commonwealth funding policy they have seen in the better part of 30 years. This is a program that outlines a public policy option which will see the most dramatic change in the way in which the Commonwealth faces its responsibility&mdash;and, ultimately, will have an impact on the way state governments face their responsibility&mdash;since the introduction of public instruction acts in the 1860s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While successive Commonwealth governments have sought to recognise the importance of the non-government sector and they have contributed support on the basis of need, this bill is framed on a policy base designed to deregulate&mdash;that is, to destroy any notion of planned educational provision&mdash;and to replace it with the introduction of a concept of market rules in education, to turn education into a commodity like so many packets of cornflakes, and to subsequently rapidly increase the rate of privatisation for public education in this society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What do we hear from this government? Contempt. We hear a minister who states publicly in his own second reading speech that this government has no preconceived ideas about the size of either sector. This is the point of choice as he sees it in terms of one group of students' responsibility for the decimation of the choice for other students who do not have the capacity to pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly that is the public position of this government. Its private position is spelt out equally clearly in the minutes of the Expenditure Review Committee of 3 and 4 June which noted that the coalition has sought to encourage students to move from government to non&hyphen;government schools. That is what this bill is all about. It is providing the financial incentive to underwrite the decimation of public education in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this bill is passed unamended it will allow the Howard government to promote its ideological view of education as a private benefit rather than a public right. Under the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> banner of choice it will encourage those who can afford to pay to separate their children from the children of those who cannot. Free, universal, quality schooling&mdash;which are the hallmarks of public education in this country and which are understood to be important in underlying any democratic society&mdash;will be in decline. A democracy which once prided itself on the concept of a fair go for all and could hold its head high in terms of the aspirations of ordinary Australians to build a genuine, tolerant, egalitarian society, will be equally undermined. The democratic ideals that go towards the notion of a universal, comprehensive public education system will also be undermined directly as a result of the actions of this government. When honourable senators are asked why this bill is so important, they should consider what their role is in ensuring or otherwise the protection of those ideals that underwrite a democratic society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under international law Australians do have commitments through their government under various treaty organisations to public education. There is Australia's commitment to international conventions such as the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the UN Convention on Rights of the Child. These treaties establish that education is a right which must be universally available to all; that primary education must be free and compulsory; that secondary education must be equally available to all on the grounds of ability and merit and must be made progressively free; and that there should be no differential in the quality of education allowed on the grounds of socioeconomic class or income of students. Quite clearly this bill will entrench Australia's failure to comply with these four basic principles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By and large Australians are not yet aware of this government's actions because it has been too cowardly to outline its real policies to the electorate. During the election it said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the first meeting of the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) after the election we will take up the issue of Australia's low OECD ranking.</PARA>
<PARA>It has failed to do this in the context of promising fairer progress that is less obstructive and more responsive to community and parental need. The only parental need con <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6090"> sidered in the legislation which has been introduced into this parliament is in the government's attack on public schools where those parents who can afford to pay will have their children schooled separately.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the government talks about low fee paying schools, many of the schools it is talking about are schools which charge a minimum fee of $2,000, which is far beyond the means of many families in this country. Surely the life opportunities that education provides must be a social investment for all our children and should be guaranteed in a democratic society which considers itself to be free.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of the budget and this bill this government is about changing the face of schooling in this country. Firstly, it seeks to abolish the planned education provision, previously known as the new schools policy, and intends that new private schools will no longer have to demonstrate that they are needed, that they can enrol viable numbers of students, that they have a viable financial plan or that they will have no adverse effect on the quality of schooling provided by existing schools in their chosen locality. Secondly, in a country which has one of the largest publicly supported private school sectors in the world, the federal government has set about increasing funding for private schools to levels greater than at any time in our history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, through the enrolment benchmark adjustments the federal government is intending to pay for the expansion of private schooling that will occur in the new deregulated and generously funded environment by taking the money from state schools. This government is deliberately setting about forcing government schools to pay for their own demise. Fourthly, through the broadbanding of equity programs, this government abdicates all responsibility for directly targeting communities in poverty or other significant areas of disadvantage, an important flagship of commitment to social justice under the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This has been established through Commonwealth responsibility for 20 years and now, with more than 10 per cent of children actually living in poverty&mdash;second only to the US <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in terms of developed countries&mdash;it is a national, social and economic disgrace which has been perpetrated and encouraged by this government's actions through its failure to recognise its responsibilities in education. This government will decide sector enrolment share only on a socioeconomic index and then allow the states to disburse the money as thinly as they please. Under these arrangements premiers can quite easily wallpaper the walls of their offices with Commonwealth dollars, as has happened in Victoria, and there are no effective accountability mechanisms within this legislation. This is a disgrace, an appalling disgrace which is being perpetrated upon the people of this country. The inadequacies of those accountability mechanisms have been established time and time again through the estimates committees and through the inquiries of the Senate education committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this bill is unamended, the Prime Minister, John Howard, with the help of the education ministers, Senator Vanstone and David Kemp, will be remembered for selling out the rights of future generations of Australians. In particular they are selling out the rights of future generations of Australians to the concept of a comprehensive, universal, quality public education system. In that process they will be responsible for reigniting the state aid debate which we all remember as one of the most divisive in this country's history. According to this bill, the unrestrained power of the market is being encouraged and equity is being outlawed. The principle of comprehensive, universal public education is being abandoned and our public schools are being left to die the death of a thousand cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The withdrawal of Commonwealth funding to the states for schooling was a recommendation of the commission of audit employed by  <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6091"> this government to develop funding policy. While Dr Kemp has denied that he will accept the advice of this body, clearly he has set upon action which is quite complementary to the advice of that commission. He is only telling part of the truth. This is, of course, the pattern of this government in its administration of education in this country; you only tell part of the truth. In the public debate you are quite sloppy with the presentation of facts about the levels of funding that you are administering and, of course, the way in which that funding is being administered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You work on one simple premise: the bigger the lie, the more people are likely to believe it. Nothing more clearly demonstrates this than the claims that are being made that there are increasing resources going to public education as a result of this budget. The department has clearly indicated in answers to questions that that is not the case. You rely upon a mythical notion that somehow the states have been spending more on education. The evidence in recent years is quite clearly to the contrary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government also seeks to introduce through this enrolment benchmark adjustment process a device whereby you will actually see cost shifting of resources from the Commonwealth to the states. In recent times I have complained bitterly about the way in which the states have used education funding to cost shift from the states to the Commonwealth. This government has reversed that process as part of its policy of undermining the commitment of national leadership in terms of education.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For every percentage transfer of students from government schools, the actual amount of direct or general recurrent funding from the Commonwealth for state school students declines. Currently, the amount for a state school student is $420, compared with $2,019 for a private school student. With a two per cent enrolment shift, the Commonwealth contribution declines to $370. With a five per cent enrolment shift it declines to $289. With a 10 per cent shift, the contribution for every child in a government school is a mere $137. With a 13 per cent shift it all but cuts out entirely. If this policy is not changed, the federal government could effectively withdraw all Commonwealth funding to state schools within 10 to 15 years. This is unprecedented.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is quite clearly demonstrating its bias to private schools. It is doing so in a manner which will ensure that the public sector is forced to pay for its own demise. In terms of social justice and democratic rights, this is intolerable. For this reason, I ask senators to consider this bill very carefully.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The abolition of the new schools policy and the end of planning provisions for the growth of private schools will, through the proposed <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6092"> enrolment benchmarks and the cuts to financial assistance grants, see hundreds of millions of dollars shifted from the public to the private sector. It will place an enormous strain on those state governments which seek to nurture public schools. It will provide enormous encouragement to governments such as those in Victoria which seek to undermine public education. It will provide a model which all state governments may well be forced to follow. Of course, it is clearly the intention of this government to fundamentally undermine public education in this society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Enrolment benchmark adjustments are a fundamental issue. They are the vehicle by which this government seeks to deliver the demise of public education in this country. State governments consider that they are being disenfranchised by the Commonwealth's failure to consult them on this extraordinarily radical proposal&mdash;this bizarre experiment that is being undertaken by this government. Many witnesses at the committee hearings that we have held argued that the use of average cost as opposed to marginal cost in calculated savings arising from student transfers will mean that there are no real savings to the states. This is transparently a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> blatantly misleading device by which the Commonwealth government seeks to shift costs to the states. Quite clearly, we are looking forward to the minister explaining in the committee stage why it is that this government has embarked upon this course of action, and why it is that this particular mechanism has been followed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decision to recoup some 50 per cent of the alleged savings to the states was based on the notion of marginal cost versus average cost. The major criticism of the enrolment benchmark adjustments is that the transfer of students out of the government system will be manifested at the individual school level, often with only very minor changes in the number of students per class. The schools will still be required to provide teachers and all the other running costs of the schools; therefore, those costs will not be a saving for any particular government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The state governments have made it clear that the figure suggested by DEETYA for attributed savings arising from this enrolment benchmark adjustment will not be realised, and that they regard the methodology employed as being totally inappropriate. The New South Wales government in particular highlighted that it would cost between $20 million and $30 million. The Queensland government indicated that it supported the concern of the New South Wales government. The Tasmanian government indicated this proposal is based on a misconception that there will be savings to the states in the enrolment mix changes. There were similar expressions of concern in Western Australia and in other states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I would like to turn to the issue of choice. This government's only rationale for this proposition&mdash;this propaganda device that they are employing&mdash;is to argue that this is a question of choice. I ask: what is the choice for government sector parents? The choice of one seriously undermines the choice of many.</PARA></SPEECH>

The bill gives substantial funding increases to schools, as announced in the August budget.

The bill therefore delivers on the government's promise before the election and as shown in the budget to deliver a quality education system for Australian students.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Various opposition speakers today and last night, particularly Senators Carr and Allison, have tried to debunk this. I would like to turn to a few of their rather hysterical reactions to the states grants bill. They do not do their cause any great service by putting their claims in such extreme and unbelievable language. I will quote directly from their speeches to prove the point that I am making.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn first of all to Senator Allison and some of her comments last night. In her speech she asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">. . . is this a bill which seeks to destroy the public education system? The answer is, yes.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Senator Carr followed up with a similar claim; that there would be no public funding for state schools in the future. This government has just outlined a package of $14 billion over four years, an increase of $1.5 billion. Given the very strict budget stringencies that we are under at the moment, and given that there has been a need for enormous savings across a wide number of government programs in this budget, we have committed increased funding. If those rather alarmist claims had any merit at all, would we not be treating it a bit like other areas? Would there not at least be a decrease? Their claims are nonsense because what this government will do over the next four years is increase funding, not decrease it.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us turn to another rather hysterical comment of Senator Allison. She asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Is this a bill which promotes the rapid and uncontrolled expansion of new and existing private schools and punishes students who remain in government schools . . .</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Allison used the words `rapid and uncontrolled expansion', which she knows is absolute nonsense. The expansion in recent years has been very modest, at about half a per cent per year. The projections under this policy are not a great deal different from what has already been happening. The projections are that it will go from 29&half; per cent of students in private schools to about 31&half; per cent. If you average that out over four years, it is really half a per cent per year&mdash;exactly the same as it was under the last Labor government. Her statement that this `promotes rapid and uncontrolled expansion' does not do her cause any good. It brings her whole case into discredit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose this was the most shameful comment of all, and Senator Carr also raised it. On ABC radio this morning they were trying to beat the same issue up. The statement was, `Open the divisive state aid debate.' The only people I have heard mention it are Senator Carr and Senator Allison. These are the only people talking about a state aid debate. Out there in the community I cannot hear any state aid debate. I cannot hear the talkback lines jammed on this issue. I do not see people marching in the streets. I do not see letters to the editor. There is no divisive state aid debate at all. That debate was settled quite properly several decades ago.</PARA>

There will be other opportunities in other places for you to respond. As I have just indicated, there is no comment out there in the public about a state aid debate. I appreciate that you are trying to stir one up, but that is the only thing we are hearing. We are not hearing that from anyone else.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did not take too many notes on what Senator Carr said. It was all pretty predictable, pretty boring. There were a few things that grabbed my attention. Senator Carr claimed that we were going to turn education into a commodity `like cornflakes'. Some <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6094"> time in some other place he might want to explain that statement. There has been a trend over time for the gradual expansion of public schools. All this bill does is continue it. He related that comment to rapid privatisation. As the figures show, that is an absolute nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Carr made the rather astounding claim in his speech: `All government funding will be withdrawn from public schools at some time in the future.' Again, like Senator Allison, Senator Carr does not do his case any good at all by making such stupid and alarmist statements. The commitment is $14 billion into the school system over four years, an increase of $1.5 billion, hardly showing a drop. He mentioned the enrolment benchmark adjustment, which has been central to this debate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those two senators have not been the only two to make misleading remarks. Sharon Burrows, who is head of the Australian Education Union, signed off on a letter to parents which contained some rather disgraceful political propaganda. We did have considerable things to say to her about that in the hearings, when we confronted her with those comments. I would have thought a head of an education union should be concerned a bit more with the truth rather than make such misleading remarks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, because we are short of time, I wanted to deal specifically with some of the comments in the dissenting report by the Democrats and by the Labor Party.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="O15">Senator TIERNEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it was not, Senator Carr. It was actually full of alarmist inaccuracies. I want to deal with number of those in detail and refute them. Let's take your first one, which says that the states and territories will reduce their spending on education. Wrong. The spending on education by states and territories in 1996-97 will increase by 6.4 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Their report says that the Commonwealth favours private schools. Wrong again. Total specific purpose payments and education funding from financial assistance grants to the states for funds per student will be almost equal in both systems. The per capita rate increase in funds for state students will be three per cent greater than that for non-government students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also says that the enrolment benchmark adjustment will cost government schools $150 million over the next four years. Wrong. There will be no change to the funding for government schools if these schools maintain their share of enrolment. It says that the EBA has been introduced because it saves the Commonwealth money when students shift from government to non-government schools. Wrong. By the year 2000, the per capita <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6095"> funding from the federal government for students in both systems will be about the same: for government schools, $2,668 per student; for non-government schools, $2,764 per student. Senator Carr does not like being confused by facts. I have put these facts on the table to refute those claims in the minority report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let's take another furphy they have put up. They said that the abolition of the new schools policy will lead to unrestricted growth of private schools, and we have dealt with that in part. The Labor policy tried to stop the development of these new schools and did not succeed. We have predicted modest growth over this time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have done is actually bring in a real new schools policy that allows for growth in the school system in response to parent choice&mdash;a matter that Senator Carr got to in the last two minutes. Choice is something that sits a bit uneasily with him. As an old unreconstructed socialist, he does not realise that we now live in a Liberal democracy. That is the basic belief of the Australian people. They want freedom of choice; they have freedom in their home; they have freedom in transport, freedom in medical treatment, freedom in jobs, freedom in recreation and, obviously, freedom in education so they can send their child to the school that they think best. Why put a brake on it? There is parent choice under this system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite what those opposite have said about funding, the broad picture overall is that the people who pay fees in private schools inject $1.5 billion a year into education in this country. That is $1.5 billion the government does not have to find. It is $1.5 billion the government can spend on the government schools or spend on any other government program. This is the basic fact which people opposite try to ignore time and time again. They make alarmist claims that, if we allow this system to continue, the public schools will be residualised. The figures put the lie to that. The reality is that 90 per cent of parents surveyed responded that they would send their children to private schools if they had the money. The reality is that they will not. It will not be unbridled expansion in the system, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> because there are natural limits, Senator Carr, which you do not seem to understand.</PARA>

So any talk of residualisation is alarmist. The private school system has been expanded clearly over the last few years. Under this policy, it will continue at about the same rate. It will eventually pull up, probably about a third of the system, because of this cost factor and the fact that a lot of people will not have the money and want to do it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The changes to the New Schools Policy and the abolition of the restriction on the level of funding that non-government schools can receive, together with abolition of the minimum and maximum enrolment limits on non-government schools, will almost certainly lead to a significant expansion in this sector. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6096"> </EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">which is to allow States and Territories to determine policies on new schools within their own system, its justification being the provision of choice for parents. However, any moves to introduce school funding arrangements that rapidly increase enrolments in non-government schools and to fund these places from cuts in expenditure on government schools is vigorously opposed.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">It should be recognised that over the years, the Federal Government has provided more than twice the per capita funding to students enrolled in non-government schools, compared to government schools. Since the commencement of funding for non-government schools, State Governments have increased their level of support to non-government schools at a higher rate than they have increased resources for government schools.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Further on in the letter, he says:</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The temptation for States and Territories to engage in cost shifting between the two sectors was acknowledged by the National Commission of Audit and cited as a major reason to withdraw from funding both government and non-government schools. The Government's current policy shift is justified mainly in terms of cost savings. However, no serious consideration or arguments are proposed within the documentation provided on the educational effect of the policy change and how such a development will improve educational outcomes for students.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">I suggest to ministers and to government members that that is a damning indictment of what you are doing. The Australian Democrats accept choice being made available to parents for the education of their children and for government funds being provided for this purpose. The Australian Democrats do not, however, accept that the consequence of choice should be cuts in state school grants. By all means, advance the private schools if you wish, but not at the expense of state schools.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not have experience of the school system across Australia, so I am going to focus on Western Australia. These are the problems in Western Australian state schools for which more money is needed, not less. The real state outlay per student in state schools has been falling. By 2001, WA schools will need to accommodate an extra 65,000 students. Class sizes need to be drastically reduced, for instance, from the current <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 32 in primary schools to 25 at least. WA has the third highest class numbers after New South Wales and Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More support is needed in classes where students with disabilities are integrated. The Court government is making schools sell their grounds to pay for capital expenditure. Attracting good teachers to the country is a real problem. To implement the Tomlinson report on schooling in rural WA needs money. In technology, New South Wales and Queensland commit $135 million over four years for the computer acquisition scheme in state schools. In WA, it is $6 million for a year. School maintenance needs an additional $250 million over the next five years. That is just a short list of why WA needs more money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Greater problems in WA schools because of less money, fewer teachers, worse maintenance and poor pupil&hyphen;teacher ratios are answered by Premier Court&mdash;how?&mdash;by his saying `Bring back the cane. Put the kids in uniform and march them around as cadets.' That is really imaginative!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Kernot and others in the earlier debate on state grants made it clear that the premiers rolled over to the Commonwealth on state grant reductions. Our plea as the Australian Democrats is that that trend be reversed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In our view, the future depends on investment in two areas and, to use the economic parlance, that investment should be on capital and labour. On capital, the government has launched the biggest anti-business package this country could ever have imagined. On labour, our schools and universities are under attack. Money is needed to invest in a secure and productive future. Schools and state grants for schools are part of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The necessary cooperation and coordination of investment into our future between state and Commonwealth ministers has been grossly inadequate. The movement of the onus from the public to the private school and from the public purse to the private pocket will be found in future years to be just not smart. It is just not good policy.</PARA>

Under the smokescreen of choice, this bill has the potential to strip significant funding from the government school sector; to destroy the orderly regulatory system of the schools in Australia, and I am talking about primary and secondary schools; to reignite the divisive state aid debate; to provoke retaliatory state government action to reduce state funding of government schools; to exacerbate the literacy problems in the community by reducing funding to the government school sector, the sector with primary responsibility for the disadvantaged sectors of the community; and to dramatically alter the ratio of government and non-government schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many elements to this bill. I want to deal predominantly with the abolition of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Labor's new schools policy and with the establishment of the enrolment benchmark adjustment measure to determine the proportion of expenditure going to government as against non-government schools, and obviously vice versa. On the issue of the abolition of the new schools policy, the rhetoric which underlies the approach was expressed by Senator Tierney, who in the committee hearings consistently referred to Labor's new schools policy as the no new schools policy.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8O6">Senator O'BRIEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you very much, Senator Tierney. The evidence really does portray that statement as utter nonsense. It shows that 251 additional, new schools in the non-government sector have been established and funded. On the evidence that the committee received, there are also quite a number of schools which have been set up irrespective of funding. That is the decision that they wanted to take. That has always been open to them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We look at what Senator Tierney has been saying, and we have to say that the evidence just does not back it up. That is what I said at the start of this speech, Senator Tierney&mdash;this debate has been marked by a lot of rhetoric. We need to look at the facts. That was the rhetoric, unfortunately, that the government used, leading up to the elections, to justify this policy&mdash;the statement that Labor's policy was of no new schools. Arrant nonsense! You know it, Senator Tierney, so does the community, so do the non-government schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With all of the evidence that we receive&mdash;notwithstanding that they wanted more funding, that they would like to have open slather&mdash;they have to concede that there has been plenty of funding for the non-government sector. The evidence is plain&mdash;251 new schools, Senator Tierney. So let us debunk the nonsense and the rhetoric that has been the basis of this policy and underlies this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new schools policy became, in effect, a real regulator of the enmeshing of the educational institutions throughout Australia in the primary and secondary schools area. We have seen and heard at the committee stage of the bill, and it was also mentioned in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6098"> debate in the House of Representatives, that a very minimal regulatory system exists within the states with regard to the establishment of new schools&mdash;very minimal. Most of the states, in fact, have no regard to whether, for example, a new school is being set up next door to an existing school, government or non-government. But the new schools policy did have regard to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill proposes to eradicate that and to basically say to the states, `It all falls back on you. You make the decision.' The evidence is that there is not the basis for proper regulation in the states. This policy and this bill will create chaos in the states in relation to this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is fair to say that even the government members of the committee are uneasy about the demise of the policy&mdash;even though they might not want to admit it. You have only to look at their first recommendation, which basically says that there should be a mechanism, which could take the form of restructured new schools committees or joint planning committees, which would need to be representative, accessible and open to public scrutiny. They are saying, `Yes, there are deficiencies. The bill does not deal with them. Something has to be done, and this is a recommendation we make.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the government members of the committee who reviewed this bill, even though they had to be loyal to their party's position to pursue this legislation, have to say, `There are some matters we are uneasy about, so we will make a recommendation and maybe it will all go away.' That is not good enough. How ill considered this bill must be if those government members of the committee are making recommendations which effectively reveal such a gaping hole in the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In another passage of the report, on page 25, the government members recognise another implication. In talking about aspects of the bill which might constrain the expansion of the non-government sector, they say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The State, of course, will retain 50% of the savings&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">capital savings&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">for use . . . but it might be expected that under such arrangements States will consider, perhaps <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> more seriously than they have before, the implications for government enrolments of the establishment of a non-government school.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">So what are they saying? They are recognising what was revealed in evidence, which is that perhaps some states will say, `We now have to take some action to haul things back to suit ourselves, so we will make things harder for the non-government schools to establish to protect our funding base.' That is what you must draw from that passage in the report.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government members of the committee themselves are concerned that there is a possible unintended consequence. It might be good for this government to say, `It is not our fault; it is the state government, go to them,' when there are problems in the states. But the reality is that this bill is removing an existing regulatory mechanism, effectively throwing it open to the free market. Their own committee is saying that there is another problem, and it might be that someone else takes a hand and becomes the regulatory body.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, the states may have a vested interest in regulating against the establishment of more new schools just so that they can protect the revenue base that supports the government school sector. It might not happen in every state, and it might not happen tomorrow, but they are recognising that this is a distinct possibility. So maybe the states will and maybe the states will not, but is that a risk that a good policy&hyphen;making bill should take? I suggest not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a topic which, if it does arise, is certainly going to arouse the passions of those on both sides in this debate. Whether they like to admit it or not&mdash;and they did hear plenty of evidence about this matter from quite a number of people, both from the government side of the debate and from the non&hyphen;government side of the debate&mdash;this bill has the potential to re&hyphen;create the state aid debate. So it is quite disingenuous to suggest that that is not a reality, that is, that the possibility is not there for this debate to be re&hyphen;created.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the subject of the abolition of the new schools policy, the committee received submissions for and against the abolition of that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6099"> policy. You could argue that the various points of view came from parties with vested interests in one or other of the outcomes that are possible with the passage or denial of passage of this bill&mdash;that they were either wedded to or opposed to the new schools policy because the outcome one way or the other benefited them. For example, certain of the non&hyphen;government school sectors would see that they had a much greater chance to expand their sector under this bill. Certainly, those who supported the government sector saw a great threat to the government sector and were supportive of the new schools policy because they saw it as a responsible regulatory measure for the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one submission which I would put to the Senate is able to be set apart from the others on that issue with regard to the new schools policy. That submission came from the Independent Education Union, which represents teachers and others in the non&hyphen;government school sector. They are reputed to be the fastest growing union in this country because of their enrolments in the growing sector which, since 1985, has grown from 24.4 per cent of enrolments to something in excess of 29 per cent. Naturally, there has been an increase in the number of teachers involved. They had positive things to say about the new schools policy. At the bottom of page 57 of the minority report&mdash;I will not read the whole passage&mdash;they are quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The operation of the new schools policy has, in our view, been to minimise that.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">They are talking about the problem with establishing schools in the non&hyphen;government school sector that were not viable. They continue:</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">I would point to the kind of experience that we had with schools in the period 1980 to 1986 . . . Over time, a good number of those schools floundered and the community disquiet about all of that is what led to the inquiry that ended up with the new schools policy . . . </EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">They did not have a vested interest in opposing this bill because the sector that they represent, it is suggested, will grow. Therefore, their potential to enrol members will grow. They were quite open and candid about that. But they were also, to their credit, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> prepared to say, `We have to recognise the very positive aspects about the new schools policy and we really don't think that it is a wise move to jettison it in the environment that we will be going into vis&hyphen;a&hyphen;vis lack of proper regulation elsewhere.'</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now turn to the enrolment benchmark adjustment. Senator Carr in the minority report dealt with that fairly well. I think the states, it must be said, are almost unanimous in their depiction of this policy as misplaced and illogical. Government members of the committee want us to pass the bill, yet even they were not convinced of the logic of the bill in relation to this funding sharing mechanism. You have only to look at their own recommendation, which is the second recommendation by government members of the committee. They do not want to do anything to the bill, and I would not have expected that they would recommend that. No doubt they would be loyal to their party position in relation to the bill. But they recommended that the department&mdash;and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">. . . undertake immediately a round of detailed consultations with the State and Territory governments in relation to the anticipated savings arising from the Enrolment Benchmark Adjustment, and report to the Minister on the outcome of those consultations as soon as possible.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Why is that recommendation necessary? Why doesn't the bill contemplate that? If that is a matter that has to be properly considered, why is this bill being rushed through now? Why isn't that a matter on which there has been much greater consultation? There has been a lot of criticism in the community and also at a government level about the lack of consultation in relation to this measure. So they are saying, `Pass the bill but rely on the minister to consult the state and territory governments.' And do what? What is the minister going to do? Is he going to rush back here and amend the legislation if it is wrong? Is that the suggestion that the committee is making? If they are not convinced, why should the Senate and the public be convinced? It is too big a question to be left unanswered. If this measure is not needed until the 1998 funding year, why rush and pass it now?</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6100">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to my own state of Tasmania, it is very clear that the Tasmanian government is concerned about the enrolment benchmark adjustment measure in terms of the funding ramifications for the state. It is also concerned about the lack of consultation. We are talking about a government that is of the same political persuasion as this government. So it is not a case of simply being partisan to a party point of view. This is the view of one of the number of Liberal state governments who are concerned about this legislation, who want more consultation and who are concerned about the financial ramifications of this bill. Again, we are being asked to rush through and deal with this matter quickly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Tasmania, there are 29 non&hyphen;government schools funded under the current legislation. Three of those schools are not fully funded and they will benefit from the passage of this legislation. I intend to deal with Senator Abetz's challenge shortly, and I will deal with that very point. There are three other schools that are not funded and yet operate. In relation to the current policy, it certainly has not been a barrier to the establishment or the functioning of the non-government school sector in the state of Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was going to refer to the evidence of Mr Graham Speight, the Principal of Bridgewater High School. That is in the table of evidence at page 157. He indicates the concerns of the government school sector, particularly as to the potential impact on a very important school in a disadvantaged area in Tasmania with a growing student number. I think the reality is that, if this bill passes, that school and schools like it will suffer. I can only, to try to deal with my remarks in the time permitted, abbreviate my comments in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This matter is too important to be rushed through, and this bill is too important to be rushed through intact. The Labor opposition will be moving a number of amendments to the bill during the committee stage. Unless they succeed, the Senate will have effectively ignored the concerns of the states and many in the community. There have been a great many submissions opposing this bill. We will be passing into law a very dubious, very <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> unsound and very dangerous piece of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come now to the challenge Senator Abetz put to me to make some comments. Firstly, I would have to categorise his representation of the new schools policy as a gross misrepresentation. Frankly, to suggest that there was opposition to the funding of the various religious and ethnic groups and that that is why there was opposition to the bill is to grossly misrepresent the position that is taken not just by Senator Allison and the Democrats but also by the overwhelming majority, if not all, of the people who oppose this bill. I remind Senator Abetz that if he looks at the list of schools that are now funded under Labor's policy he will find that the schools that fall into all the categories he mentioned, whether they be fundamentalist Christian, Jewish or whatever, are able to be funded under the same guidelines as apply to every other group in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to his reference to the Kingston Christian and Circular Head Schools, I think Senator Abetz has challenged me to justify why they are not funded. They are not funded because they do not meet those tests. If the tests need to be amended, then perhaps that is the way to go. I remind him that there are government schools that have closed because funding has not been available to support the number of schools existing in that sector. He referred to a school with 40 pupils. That school will no doubt be in a remote area, not in the areas in which the private schools operate. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 1996 as a government member of the Senate Employment, Education and Training Legislation Committee. This bill attempts to fulfil the government's election commitments to education. It puts in place a four-year commitment to basic resources for schools. Most importantly, it widens the options for parents to choose the most appropriate school for their children.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6101"> The legislation also reflects the government's commitments to providing a quality school education system for Australian stu dents, wherever they choose to attend a school. It contains additional funding for literacy and for school&hyphen;to&hyphen;work programs to ensure that when students leave school they are properly prepared to gain real jobs. It contains funding for a languages program. It contains funding for a special learning needs program. The broadbanding, which has reduced the number of targeted programs from 40 to five, still services the needs of specific client groups who are educationally disadvantaged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new literacy strategy is an important and long overdue improvement to our education system. Currently, one in five children leaves school with literacy and numeracy problems. Indeed, an article in one of this morning's newspapers commented that if children cannot read and numerate well by the time they reach about grade 3 and 4 in the primary school system it is highly likely that those children will leave school with those problems never being addressed. Certainly, the national schools English literacy survey, the results of which will be released next year, will establish benchmarks as to the way in which governments should target funding to address this very important national concern. It is this government's policy that both literacy and numeracy should have the first call on the education dollar. This bill commits funding of $45 million over the next three years, from 1997 to 1999, to this strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a great deal of comment in this debate on government versus non-government schools. As Senator Tierney did, I point out that over the next four years government is estimated to increase funding per student in a government school by 17.9 per cent and for a student in a non-government school by 14.92 per cent.

<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Over the next four years government schools will receive an additional $2.3 billion from Commonwealth sources and that is through this bill and financial assistance grants. As I said, funding for students in government schools will increase by 17.9 per cent. Funding for students in non-government schools will increase by 14.92 per cent.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to comment on the new schools policy in this way: since the election I have opened many extensions to non-government schools for the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp). At those schools I have been received with open arms as a representative of a  government that has lifted the restrictions on new schools that were placed on it by the former federal government. In fact, that policy failed because the proportion of students in non-government schools increased from 26.4 per cent in 1986 to 29.4 per cent this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That policy discriminated against low income families, far from the stereotype that is presented by the opposition of non-government schools as those being exclusively the preserve of the rich. Every single one of the schools at which I have opened extensions belonged to low income families who <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6102"> have a keen interest and a stake in providing quality education for their students whether they choose to enrol them at a government school or a non-government school. That puts paid to the opposition's claims to represent the battler.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government intends to abolish the failed new schools policy by 1997. Overall funds from the Commonwealth in 1996 provide $2,263 per student in government schools and $2,405 for students in non-government schools. There is additional funding for government schools provided by the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lastly, I would like to move to the issue of choice. Senator O'Brien I think referred in his remarks to the issue of choice being a smokescreen. On the contrary, the issue of choice is one of the fundamental educational principles embodied in the constitution and the way in which educational practice has grown up in this country. Parents should have choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee report talked about choice for parents. I refer particularly to the comments by Mr Rockman of the Australian Coordinating Committee of Jewish Day Schools. He said:</PARA>

<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Similarly, I would like to draw the attention of the Senate to an article in this morning's  Australian</EMPHASIS>  entitled `Why state schools are my choice' by journalist Deborah Hope. That article is subtitled `In the debate about private versus public education, tradition doesn't always win'. The journalist goes on to emphasise the choice that she and her family made between a government or a non-government school. She emphasised that the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> choice was one that they made for a variety of reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Choice is paramount in this article and choice is something that we should be promoting. She promotes the excellence of government schools, which is fine and that is the choice that parents make. There are many excellent government schools. By the same token, there are many excellent non-government schools. That is a choice that every parent makes on the basis of factors which they take into consideration. I might add that Ms Hope finishes the article by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And the money that we would otherwise be pouring into school fees will be going into family travel. Next stop Indonesia.</PARA>
<PARA>She chooses to make that choice because she has chosen government schools over non-government schools. Similarly, many parents make the choice of a non-government school over a government school. That is something that should be borne in mind in this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is, above everything, finding the right balance in education. It is about providing opportunities for all young Australians pursuing an education whether they be in government or non-government schools.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to oppose the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill. In particular, it is a very clear bill that has a very unclear policy shrouded underneath it, that is, the privatisation of education by stealth. It is a clear shift of dollars from the public sector to the private sector. The most important thing that the government has run by way of arguing against this is to say that those on this side who want to argue the way I want to argue are opposed to private schools. Nothing could be further from the truth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous Labor government established the new schools policy to try to make sense of exactly the sorts of concerns that the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6103"> government now claim are highest in their priority. The Labor government did not want to see new schools springing up all over the place that clearly did not have sufficient numbers to remain viable or sufficient numbers to provide the children attending those schools with an adequate and proper range of educational opportunities. It is precisely because of the Labor government's commitment to an adequate alternative provision of private schooling options for people that they established the new schools policy. There is absolutely no clear guidelines or policy from this Howard government for why it wants to abolish the new schools policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no clear evidence that the new schools policy has disadvantaged people. There is no well&hyphen;documented evidence that the new schools policy has done serious harm to the private sector. There is no evidence that children attending those schools, as instituted under the new schools policy, were given anything other than a reasonable education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the years prior to that, there was a lot of evidence that private schools that started willy&hyphen;nilly, or with very small numbers of students, certainly got into major trouble and became a significant call or drain on both the state and the Commonwealth for continued funding. The new schools policy was established to make sense and give assurance to the people choosing those options that they would continue to have the reasonable and viable education alternative for their children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another important point here. If this government were able to proceed with abolishing the new schools policy&mdash;and I do not know that it is clear in this chamber that they will be able to, but let us say they do&mdash;when and by what criteria are they going to come back into this place and say, `We got it wrong'? They have actually made sure that it is not necessarily going to be the case because they have said, `We will be shifting funding from the public sector to the private sector.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Abetz came in here with one of those marvellously spurious arguments, `You're hopeless. You're wrong. We're giving more money to the private schools and we're giving more money to the public <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> schools.' You can say what you like, Senator Abetz, but this whole bill is based on a shift. There may be more money to both sectors, but there is a direct shift of dollars from the public sector to the private sector, contingent on those enrolments increasing in the private area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why would you want to do that? Why would you want to cut money away from the public sector? Those of us who stand on this side in opposition to this bill should note, to our some time discomfort perhaps, that we are joined in our opposition to this bill by the premiers of the states of this nation, many of whom would not stand with me on just about any policy at all! They are furious about the consequences to them, of what will happen in their states as a result of this reduction in public funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Troeth was claiming that, under the constitution, there is a right to choice in this country. Senator Carr said, `Show us where.' It would be hard to find it, but there is clear evidence, which I have sought and had provided, before a current inquiry of the Senate Employment, Education and Training References Committee, which I chair, that in the constitution of every state in this country there is a bill and a promise for free secular education for our children&mdash;in other words, our public schooling system. That is enshrined in the laws and the guarantees of the states on behalf of the children of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those states are very concerned about how they will continue their commitment to free secular education. The inquiry we are actually conducting at the moment is about private funding for public schools. The public schools cannot continue on the current funding. Indeed, most states are now defining free education to refer to the salaries of teachers and some capital grants. But, if you are asking for the funding of chalk, textbooks, pigeon holes or lots of other bits and pieces that go necessarily with education, that is no longer being defined&mdash;usually by regulation or some kind of edict from the governments&mdash;as the core part of the promise of free education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More and more parents are being required to pay fees for free education. They are called <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6104"> voluntary contributions. The word `voluntary' is often dropped from the advice to parents about their contribution. We hear stories and read about them daily in the newspapers of parents who are being pressured. In one of the major dailies&mdash;and I cannot quote the place, I do not have it with me here&mdash;there was a report about one child who said, `My parents were told they would not be able to attend my speech day break&hyphen;up unless they came up with my voluntary contribution.' Schools subsequently rushed to deny it, but the evidence before our committee of inquiry has been that all over the country there is pressure on parents to make the payment of those voluntary contributions. Schools are not being provided with sufficient funding through the states or the Commonwealth at the moment to provide what any of them would call a satisfactory free secular education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my own state of South Australia, there is now provision for schools, the boards of the schools, the parents association, or whichever is the body approved in that school to make the decision, to make decisions about the sale of land on which the school is sited. Fifty per cent of the money from the sale of that land will be returned to the state, but 50 per cent will be retained by the schools to assist with their further and continuing costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One organisation from Queensland is now going around to the public schools in South Australia trying to buy land on which it will build a private child-care centre. As I said before, 50 per cent of the money from the sale of that land will be retained by the school to enable them to continue to provide what they regard as being sufficient, adequate or necessary for free secular education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In one place, the child-care centres in the neighbourhood of that school heard about this proposal and attended the meeting. They were so persuasive in pointing out the number of child-care centres around that school and that a further one at the school was absolutely unnecessary and would only guarantee the failure of all the centres that, in the end, the school decided not to proceed that way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now what is happening when schools are having to go to these lengths to find sufficient funding? They are certainly not going to be <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> assisted by this piece of legislation, which says that if students move from the public sector to the private sector, a lot of the dollars will go with them. That is not going to help state governments deliver free secular education. It is certainly not going to help the states to continue under the current financial constraints that they bear and which they have made extremely clear to the Howard government. These involve cuts to untied grants&mdash;the financial assistance grants&mdash;to the states of $1.5 billion over three or four years. I believe that one senator in here today estimated that it would mean at least $400 million out of state education&mdash;that is if the states continue their commitment to education on the current arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge people to look at the dissenting report of the legislation committee on this bill, because it points out that one way the government is obfuscating with the figures is by rolling in the financial assistance grants, or FAGs. I will read a paragraph from that report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Labor and Australian Democrat Senators note with interest that, although the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">States Grants</EMPHASIS>  Bill deals with the allocation of Specific Purpose Payments to States, the Commonwealth's submission to this Committee, and the Minister's arguments elsewhere, insist on the inclusion of attributed levels of Financial Assistance Grants throughout the Commonwealth's justification and explanation of its funding proposals.</PARA>
<PARA>There are lots of concerns. One is that the states will continue to provide something like a 24 or 25 per cent share of FAGs to education. It is also important to note that those so-called FAGs grants now include road grants of something approaching $400 million and will pass $400 million by the year 2000. That is a significant distortion of the total FAGs money that might be available to the states, from which you could ascribe 25 per cent to education. Take out the road funding first before you do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have is a significant cut of money directly to the states. We have now got a clear statement that, for the enrolments to private schools, the funding for the public schools will be reduced. It is a simple proposal. It is actually all part of allowing anybody who wants to establish a private school to do <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6105"> so, with the only real restriction on their opportunity to do that being registered with the state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The arguments are very clear. State registration might be adequate for some sorts of assessments, such as the ongoing viability of the school and the capacity of the school to provide an adequate education and so on, but it certainly does nothing for the adequate placement of our schools in this country or the overall planning requirement for the distribution of Commonwealth, let alone state, dollars for schools. It is a certain move away from the brakes, checks and balances that allow the proper allocation of both Commonwealth and state dollars to education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nobody in this place is standing up and arguing against private or public schools. If anybody says that I am, let them say it to my face in here or outside and I will make it clear that that is not what I and rest of the opposition are saying. The opposition is saying that it objects strenuously to removing the new schools policy, with its balances, program and planning, and allowing people to establish a private school with nothing more than state registration. There is now no coherent proposal or planning possible under that kind of arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Worse is the concurrent removal of money from the public sector to the private sector. The comments of Senator Murray earlier today are also very useful. Again, I say on behalf of the opposition that we do not object to private schools. Indeed, look at the history of the Labor Party's contribution to sorting out the debate between public and private schools, sometimes short handed to the expression `state aid' in times past. Labor governments have done so much to contribute to the balanced provision of public and private schooling. This bill blows apart that coherence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask the minister how he will know when this is not going well. What criteria does he have that will highlight when public schools are underfunded to the point of becoming unviable? Most public schools around this country are already screaming for more funds. They are seeking outside private funding to enable them to continue what they call basic <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> level funding. Schools have told us that some of their private funding goes to pay recurrent costs, particularly teachers' salaries, and that state governments are managing to obfuscate their books by not being totally honest about actual recurrent funding for teachers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will continue to take evidence on these very serious matters in our Senate inquiry. Nobody around Australia says that schools are so flush with dollars that they are happy to see any shift in allocations. They are not. They are struggling very much to provide the sorts of things that the parents of Australia want. The parents of Australia are asking, `If we are having free secular education through our public schools, how come we are paying and being asked to pay more and more each year by way of voluntary contributions or fees?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Funding to our public sector schools is not adequate. That is the consistent report from all over Australia. As honourable senators would have read, schools in various places have toyed with varieties of sponsorships. We have had proposals from chains, such as McDonalds and others, to start providing assistance to schools. Most education departments have worked out that they are not satisfactory provisions. Some state systems are looking at ways in which they can be assisted by private contributions and not in any way jeopardise the independence or quality of schooling provided. They are very major concerns about the adequacy of funding. Allowing new schools to emerge with no coherent planning and with no more than the requirement of state registration is moving very clearly in the opposite direction of coherence and best planned support for our schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, I ask&mdash;I am sure it is a question I asked rhetorically before and forgot to finish pursuing&mdash;what criteria does the minister have for when this proposal will need to be reined in? What criteria will we have when there are too many too small schools or is this a case of saying, `Oh, well, the states can manage that; they'll be approving the registration. If it blows up, it will blow up in the states' face and the Commonwealth will be clean'? That is a very nice policy if you can pull it off. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6106"> But I do not believe that the community will be fooled any more.</PARA>

Thousands of people do choose the public sector for their children but, more importantly, we know that even within the public sector there is a range of differences between the schools. If you visit the public sector schools in our western suburbs, they are the schools which are much less likely to find sponsorship or private assistance for them to meet what they require and regard as necessary for adequate schooling to supplement the shortfall from the state and Commonwealth allocations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further run&hyphen;down in funding to our public sector schools will do nothing to advantage those schools already struggling.

The big tick for that kind of behaviour and that kind of movement is now written in law if this bill passes. That is what this bill is about.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to participate in this debate on the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 1996. I support fully the remarks just made by Senator Crowley and earlier by Senator Carr and other Labor and Democrat speakers regarding the grave concerns that not only we have about this legislation but also the concerns felt by many people out there&mdash;parents, staff, students and organisations involved in public education in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my view, this legislation is hasty, it is ill-considered, it has been brought in with a lack of consultation, it is ideologically motivated and it is potentially damaging not only to public education or the government education sector of this country but I believe, overall, to the quality of education in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to begin by quoting from the opening paragraphs of the dissenting report of the Senate Legislation Committee on Employment, Education and Training that looked at this legislation. In doing so, I congratulate Senators Carr, Crowley and Allison on what is a very thorough review of this legislation, albeit it having to be completed in a very short space of time given the undue haste with which the government has moved in this most important area of public policy&mdash;that of education. I quote from the introduction:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6107">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 1996 represents a major shift in the financial arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States with respect to the funding of education. Moreover, it heralds the first moves by the Commonwealth to abrogate key national responsibilities for ensuring an equitable and high quality schooling system in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the past two decades the Commonwealth has assumed, for extremely good reasons, an important leadership role in promoting advances in the curriculum, teaching and infrastructure of Australia's schools, in both the government and the non-government sector. It has presided over an unprecedented rise in the number of students staying on at school beyond the compulsory years; the development and implementation of the National Goals for Schooling; dramatic improvements in the professional development opportunities for teachers; and the establishment of probably the most equitable schooling system in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All of this is being put at risk by a government which is unwilling to bear its responsibility for the promotion of the national interest . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Those two paragraphs sum up superbly the grave concerns that we in the opposition, the Democrats and people involved in government education have regarding this legislation. What we are placing at risk with this legislation is a high quality equitable education system that has been developed in this country in the last 20 years or so, one which is characterised by the cooperative approach adopted in both non-government and government schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a hallmark of our school system that we have both a viable non&hyphen;government as well as government school system. We have an equitable education system and one which recognises choice already. I will make more comments about this issue of choice shortly. The system also recognises the fundamental responsibility of the national government&mdash;not just the state governments where primary responsibility lies&mdash;to provide education funding to both government and non&hyphen;government sectors. The system also recognises the role and responsibility of national government in ensuring equity across the nation, ensuring equality of opportunity across the nation and ensuring that all children, irrespective of socio&hyphen;economic status, will have access to high quality education in their schooling years.  </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is something that cannot be achieved if you deregulate the system. If the national government abrogates that responsibility and simply leaves it to the states to once again treat education as something that may be a budgetary process for them from year to year, they will not take on board the need to look at national standards to ensure that children in all states have that equity and equality of opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that this was not always the case. Many of us can remember the divisive debate&mdash;and I recall that it was more than a debate&mdash;in the sixties over the issue of state aid and previous speakers have referred to that. It is important to recall that, because what we are placing at risk here is the cooperative spirit that has existed now for many years which put an end to that divisive debate in the sixties over whether or not government should provide support to the non&hyphen;government school sector. As one who was educated in a Catholic school, I recall how divisive that debate was within the community and within political parties, both Liberal and Labor. I pay tribute to previous Liberal governments and in particular to the Whitlam Labor government. I recall how we put an end to that division and said over the last two long periods of government&mdash;the Fraser years and then the Hawke and Keating governments&mdash;that we would never revisit that era.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The principles upon which the involvement of the national government in education is based are, firstly, cooperation with the states. It is based upon also the availability of choice to parents as to which system they wish to send their children into. It is also based upon ensuring that the role of government is to provide first and foremost a quality, universally available government school system and one which can in cooperation with non&hyphen;government school systems&mdash;particularly the Catholic systemic school system which is the largest non&hyphen;government school sector in the country&mdash;ensure that equity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this debate it is also important to remember that those who have chosen in the past and those who will choose in the future to send their children to non&hyphen;government schools have recognised that they make a contribution <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6108"> over and above that which applies to people at government schools. That has been willingly accepted. Therefore, in my view the issue of choice comes down to ensuring that the government is, firstly, providing adequate funding for the government school sector; secondly, providing a reasonable level of funding to the non&hyphen;government school sector so that that burden does not become onerous particularly upon parents who in many cases would be in low to medium income circumstances; and, thirdly, ensuring that both systems can develop in harmony for the betterment of education and for children generally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make those comments because it has never been my experience&mdash;both as a participant, a parent and someone who has been involved in the policy debate on education in this country&mdash;that people do not see the school systems as always being in direct competition. I am afraid that what we have in this legislation is an ideological motivation which deliberately intends to promote the non&hyphen;government school system at the expense of the government school sector. To my mind that represents an elitist view and that is clear from the comments made earlier in this debate by Senator Abetz. I make that comment because it is clear from the evidence that even those involved at the cutting edge of non&hyphen;government education in this country do not wish to see that polarisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For instance, Dr Tannock from the National Catholic Education Commission appeared before the committee. While I accept he did not necessarily accept all the aspects of the new school policy, he nevertheless drew attention to this very serious issue. He said that they do not wish to see an undermining of the cooperation and coordination in the policy framework which has been developed. I quote from his evidence on page 200. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We supported the principle, implicit and explicit, in the previous new schools policy of so&hyphen;called planned educational provision. We think it is reasonable that, first of all, new non&hyphen;government schools should not start up unless they are demonstrably viable and unless their quality is assured. We also felt that it was reasonable to ask people to give due notice of intention to start a school and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that it was also reasonable to have regard in the development of a new non&hyphen;government school to its potential impact on an existing school. That was our position, and that remains our position.</PARA>
<PARA>On page 202, Dr Tannock commented upon the situation in education in this country over the last 10 years. In answer to a question from Senator Carr regarding the enrolment benchmark adjustment and how it might affect the cooperative relationship, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would certainly hope not, and I would be very disturbed if it did.</PARA>
<PARA>These are the important words&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Catholic Education Commission has made it absolutely clear to both government and opposition that in general it regards the achievements of the last 10 years or more in the non&hyphen;government school funding area, where in essence the state aid issue has been settled in Australia, as a major milestone in Australia's social and educational history, and it would not want it to be reopened or revisited.</PARA>
<PARA>It is important to bear those observations in mind. They come from somebody in the non&hyphen;government school sector. When we hear the contributions of people like Senator Abetz and Senator Tierney, you would think that there were people out there right through the non&hyphen;government school sector demanding this legislation. That is not the case. It is well recognised&mdash;and the statistics prove it&mdash;that there has been a significant expansion of non&hyphen;government schools under the new schools policy. But it was done in a planned way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we were in government I had the opportunity on a number of occasions to represent the then minister, Ross Free, at non&hyphen;government school openings and government school openings. Sometimes I attended in tandem with the New South Wales minister. Schools in both sectors continually told me of their appreciation for what the then government was doing in education. Credit was given by schools in both sectors for the substantial amounts of money that were being put into the system. Credit was also given for the improvements and the policy direction. That record, of course, is substantial. In the 13 years of the Labor government we increased real levels of direct funding for schools by around 58 per cent. Retention rates doubled to 80 per cent. We implemented the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6109"> national equity program for schools which targeted children in specific areas&mdash;literacy, numeracy, special assistance in the English language and vocational training&mdash;and people with disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What do we see now? We see a strategy which, quite clearly, seeks to promote the development of new schools in the non&hyphen;government sector without any real regard to the sorts of planning requirements that existed under the new schools policy&mdash;planning requirements accepted by the non&hyphen;government school sector, as I have said. The national equity program is essentially being reduced in its effectiveness. Rather than specific targeting, these programs will now be broadbanded. With that sort of approach, disadvantaged groups will inevitably suffer. Children will once again fall through the net. What do you get if you hand more of this sort of control back to the states? Variations in monitoring, and variations in the provision of this specific special education. As time goes on, it will not be possible to ensure that equity across the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have another concern with regard to this legislation. Far from there being some massive increase in education spending, we are, in fact, seeing an overall reduction in the Commonwealth's contribution to government schools. We have seen a massive $1.5 billion reduction in financial assistance grants to the states. As it has been estimated that around 17 per cent of FAGs are spent on schools, that will result in a reduction of $250 million. Concurrently, decisions are being made&mdash;particularly by the coalition government in Victoria&mdash;to slash the provision of government school education. In Victoria, over 300 schools have been closed by the Kennett government in the name of economic rationalism. We have seen thousands of teaching positions abolished in that state. We saw similar&mdash;but, I must admit, not to the same degree&mdash;action taken by the previous Liberal&hyphen;National Party government in New South Wales. Thousands of teaching positions were abolished and school maintenance programs were allowed to run down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The New South Wales Labor government is one of the few state governments in this <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> country that is improving in real terms the funding for government schools and is trying to clean up the mess that was created under previous ministers such as Metherell and Chadwick.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On top of all this, you have the enrolment benchmark adjustment savings device to cover students who leave the government school sector and move to private schools or non-government schools. That is intended to be the outcome of this legislation. Let us make no bones about it. This is not about choice because choice already exists. This is about the active promotion of students to leave government schools and move to non-government schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The level of funding available to states is going to be reduced for each student in such circumstances by $1,700. That $1,700 represents the level of recurrent funding from the federal government that is provided to state governments for students in a government school. I believe this legislation will cause serious damage to the government school system in this country in the future. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cut will be of the order of $158 million a year on top of the cut already in untied grants to the states, which means education in the public sector will be cut by somewhere between $250 and $400 million a year. So we are moving towards half a billion dollars per annum being cut from education, when the Greens are saying that we should be going in exactly the opposite direction by exactly the opposite amount.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is it that determines whether a parent sends her or his child to a public or a private school? The single biggest factor is pupil-teacher ratio. The single biggest disadvantage to the public sector from this cut in funding is that, because they do not have the money, they cannot match the ability of private schools, particularly smaller private schools, to have a better teacher-pupil ratio. Never mind the fact that the government loses its ability to ensure that schools are presenting an equal education opportunity in the private sector to the public sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that the public sector is having the rug pulled from under it by this legislation. Every time the parents of a student choose to take their child out of the public sector and put them into a private school, the government will cut $1,000 to $2,000 out of the public school system. It will transfer some of that money across to the private school system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So you have a treadmill or a self-enhancing system which is going to inexorably, over coming years, favour the private sector at the disadvantage of the public sector. There are figures bandied about&mdash;we have heard them in this debate&mdash;as to how many tens of thousands of students are going to leave the public sector and go across to the private sector in the next few years. What we do know is that process is being enhanced by this government legislation to the detriment of one of the fundamental institutions of a liberal democratic society, which is an excellent public school system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Greens stand against this legislation. We will vote against this legislation&mdash;notwithstanding the fact that there has been some very heartfelt lobbying.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak only briefly. The Democrats passionately oppose the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 1996. Other speakers have clearly articulated in this debate what so many of us identify as an incredible funding fiddle. So when the minister says, `No, it's not at the expense of public schools,' she is wrong, and other speakers have clearly demonstrated why she is wrong. It is a massive funding fiddle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only reason I want to speak is that I want to talk about this rhetoric of choice. It seems that in Australia at the moment it does not matter what policy decision you want to make. As long as you wrap it up and attach the word `choice' to it, it is okay. But it is not okay. When you look at the policy implications and the long-term implications of what this government is calling choice, it is not okay for public education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would say that all of us in the Senate have economic choice. We can decide whether we want to send our children to private non-government schools or to government schools. We are fortunate. We have economic choice, but a huge number of Australians do not have that choice. It is the role of government to make sure that those who do not have economic choice do not get inferior choice of education. It is the role of government to say that, for the majority of students in this country who still choose&mdash;and in many cases do not have any choice&mdash;to attend public schools, they will not be disadvantaged by policy decisions which are aimed at luring or certainly making it easier for people to move from the public school system and all that that entails.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what choice does not address: who pays for the choice? Who pays for this choice? Those who already have economic choice are the parents and the students and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the teachers who are part of the public education system. If this bill were to fail, the future of non-government schools is not in jeopardy. There are some excellent non-government schools that have great teachers. The kids who go there have wonderful opportunities for learning. They have access to resources and sporting facilities and all of the things that make education a pleasure. But who pays in the long run? Under this bill, kids who do not have choice, kids who do not have access to those resources, will pay in the long run.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can talk all you like about how this is not taking money away from public schools. It is. If you want to talk about choice, in taking money from the public system and moving it across in anticipation of a shift from public education, the life choices of children who attend public education are affected. They are affected because state governments do not have the same resources to provide computers, for example. They are a luxury in a lot of state schools. Teacher numbers are affected. We all know the rules which say you can have X number of teachers if you have X number of students. We all know about the quality of teaching that goes on when you have small classes. Course options are affected. Children who go to these state schools will not have the same opportunity to study the same number of subjects.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, especially in country schools. Teacher morale is affected because we are saying, `Oh, yes it's the role of government to provide public education, but we don't actually think it is quite as important as we used to think it is.' We are not, by legislation, reinforcing the importance of the public school system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I keep saying, for those who do not have choice, that it is not about choice. It is transferring options. It is saying to people in public schools, `Sorry, you're stuck here and you have to take the quality that you get here.' This government is saying, `We're going to help the others set up. There is nothing wrong with that because we want to give them choice.' I say to this government: have your choice. People who have economic choice have economic choice, but do not <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6112"> make the students, the parents and the teachers of the public system pay for your notion of choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We hear a lot about those who are going to have the skills of the future. Robert Reich writes about this extensively. He talks about the one-fifth who have the skills and the four-fifths who do not. I will tell you who will end up in the four-fifths under this government's policies: it will be all the children who go to public schools. They will not have the opportunity to access the resources to equip them with the kinds of skills that are going to be necessary in the so-called new world order and globalisation and all the things that are going to affect life opportunities for students next century. I think it is disgraceful that this government is looking at making this move.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today in this debate on matters of public interest to speak about the ABC and, in particular, about Radio Australia. The ABC is one of Australia's primary institutions with a very significant and valued role in Australian life. The government therefore wants the ABC to continue doing what it does best and will ensure that it remains an independent national broadcaster delivering quality programming to audiences as efficiently as possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ABC will receive around $530 million in 1996-97 and $500 million in 1997-98. This funding represents a very strong commitment in a time where financial restraint is necessary. We promised on 2 March to improve the Australian economy and the situation of Australia for all Australians, and that is what we will be doing.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Through you, Madam Acting Deputy President, Senator Bolkus goes on over there saying `Look what <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> you're doing.' Senator Bolkus, had Labor, when it was in government, actually done something about the Australian economy and actually done something about retiring debt when it sold Qantas, when it sold off the Commonwealth Bank and when it spent beyond its means, we would not be in the situation we are in today. Given the fact that Labor spent beyond its means, we are in a situation where there do have to be cuts. We regret those cuts, but we are a responsible government and we are not into spending beyond our means and spending the money of the next generation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that the issue of the ABC needs to be addressed and given that its funding will be reduced, the government recognised that the ABC would need guidance to address the community's highest priorities of its activities. We have established a review under Mr Mansfield to redefine and reposition the future direction of the ABC. The terms of reference of the review stress factors such as the importance of independence and high quality service and the importance of services to rural and remote communities and other significant groups not well served by other broadcasting services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The outcome of the review will be reported to the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator Richard Alston, before the end of next year. In making its report, the review will be seeking the views of the ABC's audiences, the public broadcasters themselves and other interested parties. The minister has given his assurance that the ABC will remain an independent broadcaster and that its role is to deliver quality programming to audiences as efficiently as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, tough decisions have to be made with regard to government spending because of the parlous state in which the former Labor government left this economy. I only have to remind the Senate that the previous government announced a headline surplus of $720 million when it brought down the 1995-96 budget. In December 1995, that was downgraded to a surplus of $115 million. So, from the budget through to December last year, we went from $720 million in surplus to $115 million in surplus. By the time 12 March <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6113"> came after the election, when the information was given to Mr Costello and Mr Howard and they revealed it to the public, we suddenly found that this magnificent surplus of $720 million had gone to a deficit of $280 million. We were looking at a hole in that year's budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, every time we are concerned about spending cuts, we ought to be reminded that Australians pay $10 billion per annum in interest on public debt&mdash;debt racked up mostly by 13 years of Labor when they were profligate and they spent beyond their means. What we now have is an interest bill of $10 billion, and every Australian ought to remember that. Every Australian ought to remember, too, what happened when the Commonwealth Bank was sold&mdash;mind you, there were promises that they were not going to sell the second half before the election and then they did&mdash;and when Qantas was sold. Was any of that money used to retire debt? No. That money was not used to retire debt. You kept on your spending spree&mdash;spending money of the next generation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of the cuts that the coalition has had to make have not been easy and there has been every attempt to ensure that they were spread as fairly as possible across the portfolios. The Australian people voted for a change on 2 March. What they wanted was a responsible government that just would not keep spending willy&hyphen;nilly. They gave us the job to overcome the problems that occurred due to the irresponsibility of the previous Labor government and the task of getting Australia back on track.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ABC has not been quarantined from the need to reduce government spending. Some of the hard decisions that have had to be made in the ABC are not as a result of the cuts, but as a result of a $13.5 million blow-out in the 1996-97 ABC budget itself, hanging over from the previous government. So some of the cuts that have been made are in fact as a result of a blow-out in the ABC budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Taking into account all the constraints which will be necessary and an understanding that since Radio Australia was launched in 1939 the world has changed, technology has <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> changed and that there are new players in the field such as Australia Television, the Internet and so on, I would like to remind the Senate of the role Radio Australia has played.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Radio Australia, as I just mentioned, was launched in 1939 and has been broadcasting to the world for more than 50 years. It operates from the Southbank Centre in Melbourne. It produces 43 hours of programs for air each day in English and eight regional languages. It is distributed principally on short&hyphen;wave radio but also by audio transcription for relay on local regional stations and, increasingly, by satellite, cable and via the Internet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Radio Australia produces a comprehensive tailored service of news, information and cultural programs about Australia, its people and policies to the Asia-Pacific region in particular but also beyond. It is also involved in foreign language program production, which specialises in the major languages of the Asia-Pacific region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">International broadcasting, particularly radio, is an effective way of reaching a large and diverse audience and having an impact on the regional information agenda. It is cost effective&mdash;it is cheaper than television&mdash;it is faster than newspapers and is accessible by resource-poor audiences. We ought to remember that many people who cannot afford a television may have access to a radio. Some of those people may be potential students for Australia. That is a factor that ought to be kept in mind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the other roles that Radio Australia can play, especially with its English broadcasting programs, is in education, by assisting people to learn, to speak and to understand English. I know for a fact that there are people in the Asia-Pacific region who use English-speaking programs for that purpose and value it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Radio Australia also benefits travellers and residents abroad. Any Australian who has been out of the country for a significant period of time would know this. I can well remember that when I spent six months in Pennsylvania&mdash;on the smell of an oily rag, as a young academic trying to develop my skills&mdash;one of my great joys was to sit with my little, portable Grundig short&hyphen;wave radio <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6114"> and tune into Radio Australia. Sometimes I got the AFL football; other times I got the news.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was of great comfort to me, because it was a fairly lonely experience being away for that period of time with not much money to spend on other activities. It was a great source of comfort and information to me and enabled me to keep up to date. I know there are many others who spend longer periods away from Australia who value being able to keep in touch with developments and changes at home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Public diplomacy in the Asia-Pacific region is also an aspect which is assisted by the programs emanating out of Radio Australia. It also demonstrates Australia's commitment to Asia and projects into Asia an image of Australia. It can be used to promote Australian technology, tourism, trade and culture and to contribute to international forums and training programs in Asia and the Pacific.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also complements Australian foreign aid and trade policy objectives. Work has been done with government departments to produce materials furthering the understanding of Australia. This understanding and relationship is very important to maintain and help with business and trade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It must be remembered that trade with Asian and Pacific countries is vital. That has been brought home to us just in the last week with the APEC conference. The APEC region is Australia's most important and fastest growing regional market. The region now accounts for 73 per cent of Australia's total merchandise trade. Over the past decade, Australia's merchandise trade with APEC has increased at an annual trend of 9.7 per cent, while merchandise trade with the rest of the world has grown significantly slower, at 8.3 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The support for Radio Australia can be assessed by audience numbers. I have been advised that the regular short-wave audience listening at least once a week is estimated to be around five million. The total reach of people who tune into Radio Australia at least once a year is estimated to be 20,000,000.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Radio Australia broadcasts in nine languages. The organisation receives a considerable amount of mail from people in those nine languages, giving examples of how it has benefited them. It has been found in surveys that Radio Australia is one of the preferred services used by the elite of the region, including those who have a higher education and higher income. It is also known to be an important source of regional information for leaders and is monitored by government agencies for internal distribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer to some examples of people who have written to Radio Australia expressing support. One is Norodom Sihanouk, the King of Cambodia. I do not have time to read it, but there is a quote from an honorary minister assisting the King of Cambodia saying that when they were spending some time in Korea they were able to monitor what was happening through Radio Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other examples are King Norodom Ranariddh, the first Prime Minister of Cambodia; the minister for the environment in Cambodia, Dr Mo Mareth; Mahendra Chaudry, Secretary-General of the Fijian Labour Party; and Bernard Dowiyogo, the President of the Republic of Nauru. They have all written saying that they use Radio Australia as a source of information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The chairman of the US Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan&mdash;whom many of us did not know much about until a little while ago; we are now more familiar with him&mdash;listens to Radio Australia to get a round-up of world news before he goes to sleep. He said that it was the only reliable world news at that time of the morning. A number of other Australian trade commissioners and consuls throughout the Asia-Pacific region and beyond have written saying that they support Radio Australia and the work that it does to keep them in touch.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was interested to find out that Indonesia has a Radio Australia listeners club, for the Indonesian service, which has a branch in every city in Indonesia. One would wonder whether they would have bothered establishing a club if they were not so loyal. I am told that you can go into a city in Indonesia and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6115"> meet with Radio Australia listeners who have formed a club.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Radio Australia is a fairly minor player compared with other international broadcasters, such as Voice of America and the BBC. If there is a decision to cut back on Radio Australia, the result will be lost audiences, and it could be hard to get them back. If we leave the broadcasting to other places, then we could be disadvantaged by other countries setting the regional information agenda, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan and France. It must be remembered that these are our economic and political competitors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must emphasise that, if Radio Australia's services are reduced, the blame should be sheeted fairly and squarely home to the former Labor government. That is where the blame will lie. If those services I have just mentioned have to be cut back, it will be because Labor left this country and the economy in such an appalling state that decisions have to be made. I hope that, as the review takes place, we attempt to make&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to focus my comments on this government's industry policy and budget measures. This government lacks any vision when it comes to Australian industry. Innovation is as much lacking in this government's industry policy as innovation will be lacking in industry itself over the next decade. This government's changes to industry research and development will stifle the progress that Australian industry has achieved <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> over the past decade. This government's axing of the computer bounty will directly cost jobs. Combine these two changes with the funding cuts to Austrade and AusIndustry and this government's policies will be truly devastating not only for Australian industry generally but also for industry development specifically.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The business people I speak to are a little perplexed about this government. Australian business thought that the election of the conservatives would provide them with an environment of growth. They must be wondering where their votes have gone. It is interesting to see that the only major portfolio announcements for industry this year have been negative. Business people are shocked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there was one good news story over the past decade for industry to sell which needs to be highlighted&mdash;and indeed there are many good news stories because of Labor's role in industry development&mdash;then it would have to be the dramatic rise in commercial investment in research and development. Business spending on R&amp;D tripled between 1981&hyphen;82 and 1993-94 from 0.23 per cent of GDP to 0.7 per cent of GDP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is particularly impressive is the rate of research and development intensity&mdash;the ratio of research and development to value adding&mdash;which in manufacturing has tripled, rising over the decade to 1993 from one per cent to three per cent. This growth was achieved through government intervention that encouraged and rewarded industry investment in innovation, cutting edge technology and research.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason government intervention was needed was that in the early 1980s industry was trailing the world significantly in research investment. Australians were destined to have a lower standard of living if the economy could not shift from an economy of assets to an economy of knowledge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor recognised this and took a variety of actions over the past 10 years that resulted in the remarkable figures that I have just quoted. Commentators predicted that if this growth in innovation was maintained throughout the next decade then our economy would be transformed. Professor Peter Sheehan from the Centre for Strategic Economic Studies at the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6116"> University of Victoria predicted that if investment continued to grow as it had over the past 10 years, levels of R&amp;D spending would be high by world standards and many industry and service sectors would be leading edge and exports of sophisticated goods and services would be a major force in the national economy. Surely that is a desirable objective. It is not for this government.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7G6">Senator LUNDY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Senator Mackay. It is not for this government. The penny&hyphen;pinchers have won over the innovators and they have won over the people with vision. The budget is proof of the product of that battle. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS>  headline last week&mdash;`Goodbye Clever Country'&mdash;is right. One of the most successful industry policies has been scuttled by the Costello juggernaut of fiscal contraction. The result will be innovation contraction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The foundation of this policy of innovation was a successful 150 per cent tax concession on research and development expenditure&mdash;a business welfare initiative that even the bastion of economic rationalism the Industry Commission described last year as having brought net benefits to the Australian economy. The commission argued that its removal would lead to a reduction in GDP and that the scheme should not be changed. For once the Industry Commission got it right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reduction from 150 per cent to 125 per cent is a sign of this government's lack of understanding of industry. Industry has said that the reduction results in an actual halving of the concession because its value is in the percentage over the 100 per cent that would be available if the expenditure was written off as a normal expense. Companies are already considering moving their research units offshore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor was not the only party to recognise the importance of research and development incentives. We were not the only country to recognise its importance. Our closest neighbours, Singapore and Malaysia, offer 200 per cent concessions. Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu surveyed 125 companies, and 57 per cent that claim the concession said the reduction would have a negative effect on their research and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> development decisions. Nearly a quarter of the respondents, and 34 per cent of those already claiming the concession, said that they were already considering moving their research and development overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Taking the reduction in tax concession and the abolition of the syndication scheme together, that amounts to $2.2 billion being ripped out of industry research and development over the next four years. The government is taking a gamble with our investment into the future. Is it even worth saying that yet again the retention of both of these schemes was a pre-election promise of this government? It is a repetitive theme of debate in this chamber. I suppose the government thinks: if one promise is broken why not break them all? It is obvious that innovation and industry development does not fall into the bag of the core promise. If one promise is broken, then we see the rest fall&mdash;and we have seen them continually fall. I think this government is counting on the fact that the public will become immune to continual bad news.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will continue my examination of the government's attack on the industry through its budget measures; namely, its abolition of the computer bounty. Bipartisan support for the bounty has seen the program set to continue until the year 2000. Again this is another forgotten promise and again another promise broken. How can industry effectively plan for the future when the government changes its mind as often as this government seems to?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The computer bounty, along with other programs that the government has axed, was aimed at encouraging the development of Australia's information technologies. The exports of Australian computer hardware has increased. Information technology will be the major industry of the future, and Australia could have been riding the crest of the wave. Revenue to Australia from information technology grew from less than $20 billion in 1990 to over $33 billion in 1995. The facts say it all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is also an industry centred on small enterprises. I add very proudly that the ACT is home to a vibrant information technology <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6117"> industry dominated by small operators. Nationally, 95 per cent of these businesses employ fewer than 20 people. So we are talking about not only small business but micro&hyphen;businesses&mdash;very dynamic and happening organisations that have risked a lot to take Australia to the forefront of that technological wave.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Already companies have stated publicly that contracts have been cancelled because of the decision of this government to return to the bottom line budget cuts. Contracts cancelled mean jobs lost&mdash;not a favourable outcome when the unemployment figures are so appalling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In light of these changes, it is little wonder that the government follows up with budgetary cuts to AusIndustry and Austrade. In all reality, will there be much demand on these two bodies with the changes to the bounty and research and development? I doubt it, because not too many people will be able to afford to invest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">AusIndustry, a relatively newly expanded body, has had its funding slashed by $34 million while Austrade, Australia's trade commission, has been cut by $100 million. Australian businesses need the support that these two bodies give, the push to establish and the push to export. They have been a successful part of Australian industry. Austrade does take Australian business to the world. This government is assuming that industry can do it on its own. Maybe some will&mdash;I am sure many of them will&mdash;but how many will fail in the process from a lack of that key support provided by that government body? I repeat: what a gamble this government is taking with Australia's investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australian industry was moving towards being a major exporter of leading edge technology and products, but now I foresee that Australian industry will be a major exporter of jobs, particularly regional jobs. Although the past decade has seen dramatic improvements in industry investment in research and development, we will still trail behind countries like Sweden, Japan, the US, Finland and France in research and development spending.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> We have got a long way to go. Before this government came in we had a hope of reach ing those goals. Another decade of similar growth would have seen Australia as a leader in research rather than as a follower&mdash;a leader in the provision of sophisticated technology rather than just a consumer&mdash;and our economy and our children would have reaped the benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to the Bureau of Industry Economics, the small business sector contributed almost $500 million to Australian research and development in 1993-94. Research and development spending by small business has had a faster average annual growth rate than expenditure by big business. Indeed, the sector expenditure on research and development trebled in the decade from 1984.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not surprising, since government intervention encouraged investment at that time. It meant that once high&hyphen;risk ventures would be rewarded in some way, if not in product development. It is not a surprise that the President of the United States, Bill Clinton, chose Australia to raise the importance of information technology in the future. Information technology will be a vehicle of social and economic enfranchisement for many people around the world. But will Australia be a part of this revolution?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The high&hyphen;risk gamble here is the one that this government is taking with Australian industry research and development. The result will be many years off. This gamble will not pay off. This government's policy for industry will be seen as a mistake. In 10 years time we will be looking back and seeing a flawed policy and wondering where we could have got to if the path that Labor initiated was continued with. My greatest fear is that it will take a long time for this government to realise the seriousness of its mistake and it will not move quickly enough to rectify what I see as a glaring and appalling deficiency in its policy structure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australian industry will suffer. There will be fewer jobs. We will lose the momentum of riding the crest of the wave of the latest phase in the information technology revolution. The future will be that much less bright for the next generation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to take this opportunity to place on the record my response to Senator Abetz's highly distorted and misleading representation of comments made by me during the second reading debate yesterday on the schools bill. I was very careful to say that the Democrats could have lived with the abolition of the new schools policy provided it did not proceed at the expense of the public school sector. We do not have a problem with new non-government schools starting up; we have a problem, firstly, with allowing those schools to start up in a completely unplanned, ad hoc and unrestricted manner and, secondly, with funding those schools by taking money from the public sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very clear that, without any restrictions, a number of the new schools which seek to start operation will be small. They will be much smaller than those state schools in Victoria, for example, which are being forced to close down. It is quite clear that a number of them will come from fundamentalist religious backgrounds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I simply asked the Senate to consider whether it was good policy to fund those sorts of schools and that size of school at the expense of mainstream public education in this country. I believe the answer to that question should be no. If Senator Abetz supports that proposition, then he is seriously out of touch with the vast majority of Australians. He is certainly seriously out of touch with Australian parents who have children in both government and non-government schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to address Senator Tierney's remarks about the re&hyphen;emergence of the divisive state aid debate. One thing which was very clear at the two days of hearings of the education committee&mdash;and is also very clear to me when I talk to parents and educators around the country&mdash;is that very few people know about this bill and its impact on public education. Senator Tierney is correct in saying that people are not marching in the streets, but I suggest that they will be. It will not perhaps be in the next few weeks. It may not even be in the next few months. But right <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> now the letters are pouring into my office and they are coming from people who would have wanted to have appeared before that committee but did not do so because there simply was not time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take the opportunity today to put on the public record some of the remarks made by people out there. A letter from the Queanbeyan East Public School says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite your coalition's promises about a `fair go' for lower and middle income Australians, this legislation attacks one of the basic tenets of our society&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">the right to a decent education.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If this Bill is passed, then Australia's expenditure on education will be greatly eroded. This Bill will entrench two levels of Government schools in Australia&mdash;elite and second class. Only when a country's expenditure on education moves away from patronage for the elite does that country's ability to control their future approach reality. We would like to know the numbers of the Liberal and National Party sitting members who attended private schools. Has the Government considered the impact on all Australian schools, particularly in rural areas? Could you please consider the damage this reduction in expenditure will cause to our community's value for education.</PARA>
<PARA>A letter from Rozelle from Ms Jeanette Holloway says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government is wrong in saying that there will be a greater choice by removing the restrictions that have been in place to assess the quality of a new school before it opens. The predicted increase in the number of subsidised non&hyphen;government schools will lead to the closure of public schools and so reduce the CHOICE that parents will have within their areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Specifically I call for:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. The removal of the `Enrolment Adjustment Benchmark'. It is false to say that the government saves several thousand dollars every time a student transfers to a non&hyphen;government school and it will start a snowball effect of decreasing standards within the public school education system due to under&hyphen;funding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. The enshrinement in legislation of the provision that school education be planned, so that all can be involved in the decision making processes. The quality of education and training will affect the long&hyphen;term upgrading of industry. This should not be left to market forces.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. The enshrinement in legislation of the principle of UNIVERSAL FREE PUBLIC SCHOOLING.</PARA>
<PARA>A letter from Leeton High School in New South Wales says:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6119">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Leeton High School Council would like to register its opposition to the proposed changes to the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Assistance) Bill 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe that it is the right for all individuals to receive a quality education. Reduction to funding to Government Schools, for whatever purpose, can only be detrimental to the equality of opportunity for all. The proposed change to the legislation has the potential to create a two class system whereby Government Schools will become second rate institutions. We urge you to reconsider the proposals that will see a reduction in the per capita grant to Government Schools under the Recurrent Grants Program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our community will not blindly accept such a loss to its school.</PARA>
<PARA>A short excerpt from a quite long and well argued letter from the Sydney Road Community School says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Firstly, we are concerned at what we see as the lack of timely consultation regarding the government's intentions with this bill. As a school community, we pride ourselves on the democratic participation that is a priority in decision making in school. It is a great shock&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not intend to delay the Senate long today. I notice there are other senators who wish to make a contribution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My contribution is merely to raise a matter which is currently doing the rounds in Canberra. That is a suggestion which has been forthcoming from some people in the Department of the Environment that we should put a charge on recreational boat owners who enter the waters of the Great Barrier Reef.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you happen to live in Canberra, I am sure this might well be a wonderful idea.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately for the thousands and thousands of people who make their home on the coast of Queensland&mdash;and most of the coast of Queensland is adjacent to the waters of the Great Barrier Reef&mdash;such a proposal is absolutely ludicrous because it would basically be a charge on people who want to use what is effectively their own backyard. There is quite a degree of difference between people who use national parks or world heritage areas for a commercial purpose and private individuals who wish to utilise those facilities for their own personal recreation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Heaven help us in this country if we ever go down the route that has been suggested by various government departments from time to time where we would put charges on Australians enjoying recreational opportunities. There was a suggestion put forward by the Industry Commission some years ago that we put a charge on people going to the beach. That suggestion received the short shrift it deserved because it was ludicrous and contrary to the Australian way of life.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6120">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a Queenslander and as a representative of the National Party, let me say very clearly: nobody would accept a proposal to put a charge on private individuals using Lake Burley Griffin; nobody would accept a proposal for private individuals to be charged for taking their own pleasure craft on Sydney Harbour or on Moreton Bay; so why should people in Canberra or people in the department think that it would be at all acceptable that a charge could be put on private individuals who use their own boat on the waters of Queensland that happen to be adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef? It is thoroughly ludicrous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me make it very clear that my National Party parliamentary colleagues and I will not accept any proposal that the department may come forward with to that end. I know Senator Hill is a very reasonable and intelligent man and I know Senator Hill would see through a suggestion like that coming from the department. But we can save the bureaucrats a lot of time by saying that the way of life that people enjoy in Queensland, especially along the Queensland coast, must be preserved. The right of people to get their own boat and use the waters of the Queensland coast is one of those rights that must be preserved; it is part of the way we live.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People already pay registration charges to the state government and that is a completely different issue because every boat owner has to pay those charges&mdash;and they help fund the operation of harbours and marine matters. It is not at all acceptable to think that we would be willing to wear this. It is very fanciful, indeed, for the bureaucrats to think that they might ever get support from the parliamentary National Party for that proposal. I say in conclusion that those people who might be sharpening their pencils in departmental offices here in Canberra can put them away, and put away the bit of paper as well, because this proposal is one that should go for a long swim.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<TIME.STAMP>(1.25 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to report the very responsible decision by the government, announced by the Minister for Transport and Regional <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Development, Mr Sharp, to invest $2 billion in reforming Australia's rail system. This is a visionary policy and will overcome the mess left by the former Labor government. We have a situation in Australia where the rail system has been allowed to run down disgracefully. Yet we have the sorts of economies available that would make rail transport very competitive with road transport if it was set up and run properly. That is what the minister has announced he intends to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will offer Australian National Rail for sale. It will sell the Commonwealth interest in the National Rail Corporation and set up a national track authority to manage the system which will run both public and private trains. This decision is a renaissance for rail in Australia. It will reverse the slide over the last 13 years in rail's share of the national transport system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decision is essential because if we let it run on as the previous Labor government had let it run on, the financial and job consequences were going to be absolutely catastrophic. Labor's mismanagement was condemning Australian National Rail to a slow and certain death. The former Minister for Land Transport, the member for Charlton, Bob Brown, stands condemned for his role in this. What he did was set up National Rail, which was basically a freight operation. That was fine, but he left the Australian national railways, the remaining segment, to hang out to dry. He took away its most lucrative business and left it with all its debts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You do not have to be a mathematical whiz to work out that if you create a situation like that and just leave it year after year, with revenue plummeting and debt servicing rising, you have a financial catastrophe on your hands. That is what the last Labor government has left us with and that is what Minister Sharp has now moved decisively to fix up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The extent of the mess left by the previous government is indicated by the fact that the taxpayer is currently subsidising each rail worker to the tune of $60,000. Within four years that is going to blow out, if this matter is left unattended, to $220,000 per worker. That was the subsidy this former government left us with. It has left us with a huge clean&hyphen; <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6121">up bill and the clean&hyphen;up bill has a $2 billion price tag attached to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me outline the essential elements of this policy. Rail services in Australia will be rejuvenated through private sector involvement. This government will take over the debt and it will leave the new owners with a clean state of unencumbered assets. A regime for competitive national track access will be established and there will be one authority, under the control of the government, which will manage and control the interstate network.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">World's best practice has shown what can be achieved in rail with private sector involvement. I would just like to mention two examples. In the United States, rail has been traditionally privately owned. Their rail is up to four times more efficient than our rail system. New Zealand are recent newcomers to privatisation&mdash;so they are quite a good model to follow. Tranz Rail New Zealand was privatised in 1993. It is already 50 per cent more efficient than Australian National. It is carrying 15 per cent more freight than it was two years ago. So while our system has continued to decline under public ownership, in New Zealand under private ownership it is increasing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prior to this announcement by Minister Sharp there had been, with his approval, a number of pilot operations on the rail system where private companies were able to move freight. TNT is now offering a private freight service between Melbourne and Perth, and this package of reforms will allow this type of rail service to grow. Why so much is carried by road in this country, which has such an extensive rail network, has often amazed me. The reason why it has been is that, with a very inefficient public infrastructure, the carriers who depend on speed of delivery and timing could not trust the publicly owned utility to move the goods at the time they wanted them to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we give carriers control at both ends of an operation involving the moving of material from, say, Melbourne to Perth, as TNT is doing, they can move their prime movers into the rail depot in Melbourne, put the containers on a train and get their trucks to take them off <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> at the other end. They control the operation from start to finish. With that sort of confidence and control, the private operators will access this service, and with that private sector involvement we will find, as we have found overseas, particularly in New Zealand, growth in rail traffic. This private sector involvement will also ensure that there are more jobs in rail than there are under this current system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Freight will not be the only area of growth. This government is dedicated to turning two of our greatest potential tourist assets into dollar earners for Australia. I refer in particular to the Ghan and the Indian Pacific&mdash;world&hyphen;class rail journeys which would become, if a little flair and investment were added, very profitable businesses. We are offering those assets for sale to a private company. If they are not taken over by a private company, the government has guaranteed that those world&hyphen;class rail journeys will continue under a public corporation. But we will be putting much more of a tourist spin on it, particularly in the lead-up to and the lead away from the Olympic Games.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at what this turnaround will mean for jobs by contrasting what we are about to do with what Labor had done during its rather sorry and disgraceful stewardship of the rail system. During the last 13 years of Labor, 7,000 jobs were lost in the rail system. Under Australian National's business plan signed off by Kim Beazley and Laurie Brereton in the dying days of the Keating government another 1,000 jobs were earmarked to be lost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This major micro&hyphen;economic reform we are intending to make will turn rail into an efficient, competitive and reliable transport provider. There are, of course, offset costs to achieve the reforms that are needed as a result of Labor's incompetent management of the system. The major components of the $2 billion package that Minister Sharp has announced include $112 million for redundancies, unfunded provisions from employee super and other entitlements of $90 million, acquisition of debt costing $779 million, a regional assistance package of $20 million to mitigate the effects of restructuring and $126 <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6122"> million to be expended on outstanding contracts and liabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has made a very difficult decision. The last government left the rail system in a complete mess. We could not allow it to continue, but turning it around needed a very bold initiative. I am quite confident that, with a very imaginative combination of private and public sector involvement, the train system in this country will be back on track.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to mention another aspect that is very important to my own area in northern New South Wales, and it relates to the world-class train making facility at Goninans in Newcastle. As part of Minister Sharp's restructuring package for rail, he is honouring and guaranteeing the contracts that already exist for the production of locomotives at the Goninans plant in Newcastle. At the moment they have a contract to build 120 first-class locomotives at a cost of $420 million. That will continue. It is essential that that continue because not only do we need a world-class system but we need a world-class freight carrying facility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former managers of Australian National and National Rail told us that, when the National Rail Corporation was set up in 1992, as part of the agreement the rolling stock that was handed over to them by the states was generally older stock. At any one point 25 per cent of it was out of action, needing repair. That is an intolerable situation. People will not freight materials if we have those sorts of inefficiencies. This situation is to be corrected, and we guarantee that the plan to correct that will stay in place. There are to be 120 new locomotives for Australian National and $420 million is to be spent on these contracts, which are a great job booster for the Hunter Valley.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and Minister Sharp will be at Goninans tomorrow for the launch of the new diesel locomotives. I confidently predict that, as a result of this new arrangement, firms like Goninans have a very bright future because not only will they have the contracts to complete those but there are real flow&hyphen;on opportunities in the South-East Asian market for the building of similar <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> types of locos for the tiger economies of South-East Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I congratulate the government and the minister on this excellent package. It will put our rail network back on track and ensure that another piece of the jigsaw in the micro-economic reform agenda is put in place.</PARA>

<ANSWER PAGE="6125" SPEAKER="Alston, Sen Richard" NAMEID="LD4" ELECTORATE="VIC" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Communications and the Arts" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Panizza is absolutely right. There is a very serious <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6126"> problem here and it goes to your economic credibility. It is beyond comprehension that Mr Beazley said, as he did, in response to questions about Mr Sharp's $2 billion reform package, that taxpayers have been carrying debt on rail systems for a long period of time and that AN's debt could have been subsidised or sustained for a few years yet. That is absolute nonsense. It might be pandering to a few people who simply want to turn a blind eye to these problems but it is utterly irresponsible. It is interesting that Mr Beazley cannot get his lines straightened out with his shadow minister for transport who said, pretty much at the same time, that the debt is too high.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You cannot understand how these people can get it so wrong so often. The fact is that Mr Martin Ferguson, who is the shadow minister for employment and training, on the same issue said that the key to security in life is job security. The fact is that you are the crowd who presided over 7,000 job losses at AN over the period of your government and in 1995 Mr Brereton and Mr Beazley both announced a jobs loss package of a further 972 jobs over a four-year period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If Mr Ferguson is right, that the key to security in life is job security, then what can you offer them other than that sort of continuing deterioration? It seems that your idea of job security is simply to put people on the scrap heap. It is very disappointing that you cannot comprehend the difficulties that are obviously apparent to everyone else and do require the firm and decisive action that Mr Sharp took.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That does point to a much wider problem that the opposition has on this and other issues: they simply have not learnt from their mistakes. Not content with bequeathing us an $8 billion black hole, effectively what Mr Beazley is doing is trying to dig even more black holes into which you are about to tip more and more workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem with AN is that it has something like 500 employees at the present time but it has enough work for 50. What are those people meant to do? They are not unproductive; there is just no work for them because of your so-called restructuring. That is an <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> absolute tragedy. That is an issue you ought to face up to if you are serious about the significance of employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think all of this is summarised in the news poll in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, which makes it clear that Mr Howard is regarded as more trustworthy, less arrogant, more likeable and more caring than Mr Beazley. When it comes to who is best to handle the economy, what do we find? A massive 54 per cent to 22 per cent difference. If you analyse that, what do you find? Less than half of Labor voters endorse Mr Beazley and 24 per cent of Labor voters support Mr Howard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In other words, the Australian community overwhelmingly understands that in order to get the economy back into shape, to get Australia moving ahead again, you have to take some tough decisions. It is a great shame that you were prepared to endorse privatisation in government but now in opposition you take this opportunist, negative approach to issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps you should have a look at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Telegraph</EMPHASIS> in England, which I happened to have sent to me today by one of our networks of international contributors who are all appalled at the way in which the Labor Party in this country simply buries its head in the sand. This reports that even the left leaning French weekly, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Le Nouvel Observateur</EMPHASIS>, claims that it is now quite apparent that economic issues in the UK might have been handled in the right way all along, and they deal particularly with privatisation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An assertion was presented yet again in the question today that funding to government schools is going down.

The quarterly `Social Security compliance report', which was tabled this morning, reported that your department had significantly improved its efforts on the fraud and compliance front in the September quarter of 1996. What improvements in administration has this government put in place to bring about these dramatic savings of taxpayers' money and how do these reforms assist genuine welfare recipients?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a very good question from Senator Knowles. Do you remember, Madam President, the former minister Peter Baldwin who constantly used to crow how you could not do anything to the social security system to make it any cleaner? In August last year, he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In fact, what we do by way of compliance is now recognised as being of world leading standard in many respects.</PARA>
<PARA>We, when we were in opposition, did suggest that it could be done better. He would rubbish us and would crow again about how great his system was. I remember him talking about a United States professor in 1993 who said how top notch the system was and how it could not be improved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These new compliance figures that were tabled this morning put the lie to all these claims. If Mr Baldwin's system was so good, how come the department in the past year has increased the number of compliance reviews by 27.6 per cent? That is over one-quarter more reviews, with the resulting increase in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6132"> payment cancellations nearly 30 per cent. The figure that really exposes Mr Baldwin's posturing is that recovery of debts has increased by $26 million in the quarter to $84.4 million, which is an increase in debt recovery of 44 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other improvements have been a 31 per cent increase in investigations of reports from the public and a 20 per cent rise in the savings achieved from data-matching. It is hard to claim that you have got a world-class social security system with no substantial rorting if, in the space of one year, the department has achieved 20 per cent plus gains across a range of fraud and compliance indicators. I welcome the improvements that the department has made since the change of government. I do commend the department's hardworking staff for their efforts which have been vital to the success of the exercise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has placed greater priority on addressing fraud and non-compliance. We have announced a number of further initiatives in the budget, such as: tightening activity testing, changed penalty provisions, medical reviews, computer investigation and analysis, extra resources for raising recovery of debts, legislative changes to allow DSS to maximise overpayment recovery, and data-matching to include parenting allowance customers as well as customers' aliases and maiden names.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For too many years, the vast majority of honest DSS customers have been besmirched by the cheating of the few. We intend to restore the integrity of the social security system. This first quarterly report indicates that we are moving in the right direction. We are aiming to bring back respect rather than suspicion for social security recipients. We intend to eliminate the waste of taxpayers' money. The member for Werriwa, Mark Latham, said in a very interesting speech last July:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For those who support the ideals of the wealthy estate, the restoration of its relevance and legitimacy is a first order task in public policy.

You can continue scaremongering, if you like, on the basis of earlier reports. But until this matter is settled there will be no further comment from the government, other than to say that if there is a problem we will, of course, act to fix it.</PARA></TALK.START></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question without notice is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Senator Vanstone. Does the government intend to take any action to ensure advocacy resources to clients of the Refugee Advice and Casework Service in New South Wales&mdash;I might say it is a very good body&mdash;which has closed following a dispute over funding? I think there are 107 clients involved in that area, but don't hold me to that. Is it true to say that these asylum seekers have been left without advocacy assistance and have, in effect, been put into limbo? Did the Legal Aid Commission's managing director say, `The capacity of my <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> staff has reached its limit,' and, `The most simple solution is obviously to resolve the funding deadlock'? Could whatever action the government intends to take to resolve the funding crisis faced by the Refugee Advice and Casework Service be taken urgently?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Cooney, I have some information in relation to this matter. I will give you what information I have. To the extent that more is required, I will ask Mr Ruddock to come back.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand there was a suggestion in a press release by Duncan Kerr a few days ago that Legal Aid New South Wales is under pressure to take over RACS New South Wales cases. It is apparent&mdash;if that is what you are referring to, and I think it is&mdash;that Mr Kerr does not have all the facts on the matter of applications assistance and contract negotiations within RACS. Funding has not been withdrawn from RACS. At the beginning of November, RACS were advanced funds to continue to supply application assistance until 30 November. RACS has chosen not to draw upon these funds. In addition, RACS has informed the department that they will not accept further detention case referrals. Agreement on contracts for this year has been reached with all contractors other than RACS New South Wales, which has asked for a 10 per cent increase in their unit costs. We are prepared to grant an increase of three per cent, consistent with the increase sought and approved for RACS in Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are continuing to negotiate with RACS in good faith and in the proper manner&mdash;that is, on a one&hyphen;to&hyphen;one basis. However, it is increasingly difficult to do so in the very public environment which now exists. We simply cannot negotiate by press release; that is not appropriate. As has been the case throughout this process, we are prepared to continue to seek an appropriate solution. RACS remain responsible for cases on which final decisions have not been made, but for which they have received payment. We have not asked the Legal Aid Commission of New South Wales to take over any RACS current <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6135"> cases. Should the situation warrant, we will enter into proper discussions with Legal Aid as one of the agencies funded to provide application assistance services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is as much information as I have now, Senator. But if you want more, I will get that answer referred to Mr Ruddock. He can add such as he chooses. If there is any further information you require, I am happy for you to give it to me during the afternoon.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs and concerns small business incubators. As we know, small business drives employment growth in Australia. Small business was stymied by red tape and discouraged through high interest rates <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and the unfair dismissal laws under the previous Labor government. Can the minister inform the Senate of any actions that she has taken to assist the growth of employment through encouraging the successful establishment of new small businesses?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="6135" SPEAKER="Vanstone, Sen Amanda" NAMEID="7E4" ELECTORATE="SA" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Abetz for that question. It was with much pleasure on the weekend that I was able to announce quite extensive funding to 11 new small business incubators, the funding totalling $3.4 million over three years. What the incubators do is provide a common location for new businesses wanting to start up which can access management, marketing and administrative support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Through the incubators there is the use of mentors with relevant experience to the new business. This gives some assistance in keeping that business going in the early stages. People are able to draw on the advice of someone in a similar business who has been through similar experiences. One would expect that that sort of mentoring assistance is very valuable and will assist more small businesses that use the incubators to get through that critical 12-month period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After they are established, the businesses leave the incubator and act as independent businesses on their own, like so many others. More small business incubators means more successful small businesses, and that means more new jobs. Most new small businesses fail within the first five years, and it is believed incubators do something very substantial to reduce that rate of failure, to keep those businesses going and, therefore, to make real jobs in small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all understand that, while big business is important, the generation of new real jobs is likely to come from small and medium sized businesses, and the generation of 11 new small business incubators will go some way at least to enhance those opportunities. After three years, the incubators themselves become independent of the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem was that Labor ignored the potential of small business. They said a lot about it but did very little for them. They were very anti&hyphen;small business. Lots of red tape and the unfair unfair dismissal laws put <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6136"> small business off taking new people on and may have contributed to the fairly large increase in people taking up part-time work. The opportunity for full-time work was not there because of the disincentive of the unfair unfair dismissal law. The coalition recognises that a healthy small business sector will result in employment growth, and it is for that reason that we are prepared to put in $3.4 million over three years to establish 11 new small business incubators.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">QUESTION WITHOUT NOTICE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SENATOR NEAL&mdash;26 NOVEMBER 1996</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">COST SHIFTING&mdash;HEALTH SYSTEM IN NEW SOUTH WALES</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SENATOR NEAL&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Family Services. Do you realise that your government's planned $34 million worth of cuts to the New South Wales health care system will mean the closure of 400 hospital beds and the loss of 900 doctor and nursing positions and that this will have a devastating effect on the people of New South Wales?  <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SENATOR NEWMAN&mdash;Claims that the cost shifting penalty to NSW will result in the closure of hospital beds and the loss of medical and nursing positions within the public hospital system are without foundation. Such assertions are merely scare tactics on behalf of the State government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The method of calculating the penalties balances the long term and short term trends in cost shifting. I refute any claims that any particular State is being singled out&mdash;though clearly each State would prefer a method of calculation that favoured its circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Using this method, NSW adjustment in 1996-97 is $33.4m or 45% of the total $75m adjustment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> per capita expenditure in NSW under the MBS were 15% higher than the average of all other States in 1995-96; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> under the diagnostic imaging and radiology parts of the MBS, where there is more scope for cost shifting, per capita expenditure in NSW was 24% higher than the average of all other States.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cost shifting adjustment represents only 2% of the $1.5b Hospital Funding Grants (HFGs) which will be paid to NSW in 1996-97. Even after this adjustment, HFG payments to NSW in 1996-97 are still 1% higher than they were in 1995-96.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should also be noted that, even after adjustment is made for the cost shifting penalties, the funding which NSW receives, on a per capita basis, resulting from the Medicare Hospital Funding Agreement, is higher than the average funding which other States receive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth is proceeding with imposition of the penalties as continued double dipping by the States simply cannot be tolerated. However, there may be some scope for flexibility in the way the measure is implemented. Any reasonable proposal by any State aimed at improving the way the Budget measure has been implemented will be duly considered. The States have been advised by the Department of Health and Family Services that, if they wish to bring forward soundly based proposals for alternative means of allocating the penalties, these will be considered.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All things considered, the States have got off lightly. We have only looked at the growth factors in cost shifting since June 1995 as a baseline point. This is not a reflection of the full extent of cost shifting, nor have we pursued cost shifting over past years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SENATOR NEAL&mdash;How does this proposal sit with Dr Wooldridge's statement in May this year, that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Commonwealth would only agree to specific changes to existing arrangements with the State and Territories if . . . the proposed <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6137"> arrangements . . . provide a better deal for service users?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further, how does your answer accord with Dr Wooldridge's recent statement on ABC radio, that New South Wales is not cost shifting now?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SENATOR NEWMAN&mdash;Practices which result in ripping off the wider health system to the tune of $300 million a year can hardly be regarded as providing a better deal for service users. This is precisely what the States have been doing for quite some time now.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth, by its actions in addressing cost shifting activities, is protecting Medicare, which simply could not be sustainable if cost shifting was allowed to continue unfettered.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Moreover, the cost shifting initiative acknowledges features of `best practice', pending possible structural changes in the delivery and financing of ambulatory services generally, in that persons can access services most suitable to their needs and provided in the most convenient environment, whether this be at a public hospital or in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In regard to the Dr Wooldridge's comments on ABC radio, the Honourable Senator is mistaken if she is referring to the 2BL broadcast on 20 November 1996. In that broadcast, the Minister for Health and Family Services said, and I quote, "New South Wales hasn't cost shifted a lot in the last 12 months because there is nothing left to cost shift. They've done it all before. They just did earlier than other states."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clearly, if New South Wales has stopped cost shifting this will show up in data being provided by doctors from 1 November and such an improved performance will inevitably be reflected in smaller cuts to be made&mdash;if indeed any&mdash;from NSW or any other State.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston), to a question without notice asked by Senator Bob Collins today, relating to aviation safety.</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) has made a number of decisions since his appointment in March. Two of those decisions were made not in the interests of aviation safety; they were made in order to blatantly reward those who supported them during the recent federal election campaign. They were political paybacks with a sting&mdash;a safety sting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first decision was to allow the use of portable emergency locater transmitters as well as fixed DLTs. In doing so, Mr Sharp overrode the advice of the technical experts in safety at the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. He also thumbed his nose at the experience and practice of every other country in the world. CASA made a decision to require the use of fixed automatically activating emergency locater transmitters in all aircraft. It was CASA's view that this system offered the best level of safety. It is also the world view. The minister overturned that decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was purely and simply a reward to the Australian Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association for its up-front political support for the coalition during the campaign. CASA had no option but to comply with Mr Sharp's ministerial direction&mdash;even though, in my view, it may have placed the organisation in breach of the Civil Aviation Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second decision concerns the imposition on Australia's civil aviation search and rescue units of the precision aerial delivery system&mdash;PADS&mdash;search and rescue system. In taking this decision, Mr Sharp ignored advice from such experts as the RAAF Aircraft Research and Development Unit. The RAAF unit tested the PADS system in 1995. Let me quote from the summary of the RAAF report. It states:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The PADS system was considered to be unacceptable for release as the first PADS drop resulted in large amplitude rotational motion of the static line and the drog impacting on the elevator of the release aircraft. Consequently, flight testing was suspended.</PARA>
<PARA>It is there in the RAAF report in black and white. This equipment was so dangerous it was recommended that it should not even be trialled, let alone put into active service. I asked a number of questions about the problems of the PADS system in recent hearings of the Senate estimates committees. I was advised by a senior officer of Airservices Australia that these deficiencies identified by the RAAF with the new system had been addressed `in the new model'. I was further told:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have received advice that they have been addressed.</PARA>
<PARA>We found out in further questioning that these assurances had come from the company that manufactured them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister then released a media statement on 23 September, announcing that the government had decided to equip Australia's aviation civil search unit with this PADS system. The minister said that there had been an independent evaluation of the PADS system&mdash;that is, independent of the RAAF&mdash;and that the system was currently in use. The PADS system had been found to be superior. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 90 days the deployment of the PADS units and training will have been completed providing a final solution and closing the book on this long standing and controversial issue.</PARA>
<PARA>The book is far from closed on this issue. The initial PADS training was conducted on 9 and 10 November at Jervis Bay. There were 13 drops of the search and rescue equipment made. I am advised that in seven of these drops&mdash;that is, seven out of 13&mdash;there were equipment failures, including problems involving the rope and static line. This is the equipment that the minister had independently evaluated and has spent nearly $700,000 of public money on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand the particular incident that saw an aircraft nearly lost involved not an equipment failure but a breakdown in procedure. It appears that the government has chosen to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6140"> ignore the advice from the RAAF Aircraft Research and Development Unit but the release altitude for PADS of 100 feet&mdash;that is above the water&mdash;is unsafe. I understand that the aircraft that was involved in this incident was operating at an altitude of 100 feet when it got into difficulty. At that altitude, there is clearly no margin whatever for error. The failure of the government to accept the RAAF advice had put the crew on board this aircraft at risk, and the minister should be held accountable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that the use of PADS, having spent $700,000 on it, has now been suspended and that aviation civil search units have been directed to revert to the existing Airservices Australia SAR systems. These systems have only a one-year currency, and a number of the units are now reaching the end of their use-by date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Aviation Civil Search Organisation in Australia is now under threat of collapse as a result of this political fix&mdash;all because the minister is indulging himself in a political pay-off. There are a number of outstanding answers to questions I asked in the estimates hearings about both the ELT issue and the PADS issue, which I am advised have now been sitting on the minister's desk for more than two weeks. He has simply ignored the deadline for those answers, which was 11 November. I can only conclude at this stage that it is because the answers he has sitting on his desk are not to his liking.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston), to questions without notice asked by Senator Mackay and Senator Panizza today, relating to Australian National.</PARA>
<PARA>In his answers today, Senator Alston continued to exaggerate the circumstances that Australian National finds itself in. He was trying to shift the attention away from the bottom line of AN's operations and attack the opposition for being irresponsible. It is very irresponsible for the government to continue <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to mislead the community and keep information to themselves about the true circumstances of Australian National.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has clearly been a long-term plan by the government to discredit Australian National so that they can justify its sale to private interests. This has been an ideological exercise aimed at making sure that this government can show off its privatisation credentials. All of the facts about AN should be put on the table, not just the selected facts that we have been given access to. The government's secrecy about the future of AN has been outrageous. It is obvious that they have been planning to sell it all along.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Brew report, or what we saw of it in September, estimated that AN's losses for the 1995-96 financial year would be between $135 million and $148 million. The Minister for Transport and Regional Development, Mr Sharp, told the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program last weekend that it would be $250 million. The minister did not mention, however, that over half of the claimed losses is accounted for by the write&hyphen;down value of some AN assets due to an asset revaluation program. Then there is the money that is accounted for redundancies and other abnormal costs. The truth is that AN has done a bit better than the Brew report predicted in so far as its accounts are concerned for 1995-96.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today Senator Alston alleged that the opposition was quibbling about how the debt was constructed. The fact is that this parliament has every right to know about the financial circumstances of AN. It has an obligation to the community to make you come clean about the motives. Then there is the $50 million set aside for potential clean&hyphen;up activities, which adds to AN's overall liabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Mackay asked a very reasonable question about this and received a very unconvincing answer. Are there any other possible contingencies that the government can tack on to the liabilities list? The reality is that $50 million would only be used for the clean&hyphen;up of sites after they were no longer a part of the rail system, and that could be in many years time. The difficulties encountered by AN have been exploited and exaggerated <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6141"> by this government in an effort to make it look as though the end of the publicly owned rail service is nigh. The truth is that AN has a bright future if it is left to its own plans and allowed to develop its own business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My experience with AN workers and their unions has shown me that there is a real commitment to ensuring that rail becomes more profitable and efficient. The government has apparently begun a campaign to try to convince the electorate that this sell off is a rebirth for rail. But if $200 billion is set aside for redundancies and leave entitlement payouts, what is the future of jobs in rail? To say that Port Augusta and Launceston are going to be better off because of the privatisation of rail is to refuse to accept all the evidence and previous experience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These communities need new industries on top of what is already there. The local members who participated in the government backbench committee on this issue should hang their heads in shame. They have betrayed the people who they promised to represent. They have allowed the decline of their own communities to occur without putting up a fight and questioning what they were told.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has shown its contempt for rail workers and their families by playing their lies for their own political ends. They have also shown a disregard for this parliament by their selective presentation of the facts about Australian National.</PARA></QUESTION>

<STATE> (Tasmania)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(3.17 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to join in the debate on the motion moved by Senator Foreman. The only real praise that Senator Foreman could provide to AN was that they had done a little bit better. That is hardly wholesome praise, is it? He said that they did a little bit better than had originally been anticipated. The reality is that they have done shockingly over many years. That is, unfortunately, the result of government neglect which we, as a new incoming government, are now addressing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were told by Senator Foreman that somehow we have contempt for the lives of railway workers. Senator Foreman, through you, Mr Deputy President, allow me to remind you that when you people came into <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> office there were some 9,200 railway workers in this country. There are now slightly under 3,000, about 2,500. You looked after them really well, didn't you? That is a fantastic record of looking after railway workers!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that we were left with a mess. We have to clean it up and we have to deal with it in such a way that not only the railway workers are guaranteed a future but, more importantly, the whole network itself is guaranteed a future. If we continue along the path that has been suggested by the Labor Party, we would be in a situation where we would be subsidising each and every rail worker in this country to the tune of $220,000 per annum. What a great scheme! Let it keep going and ballooning out and ballooning out. Let it cost the taxpayer not hundreds of thousands, not millions, but in fact billions of dollars. Really, it was an unsustainable situation. I think Senator Foreman knows that in his heart of hearts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the workers, all their full entitlements have been guaranteed and they will be protected. He asks why we have made a provision of $112 million for redundancies. The reason is that, as anybody who knows anything about AN and the work force knows, there is an accrued liability on average of $55,000 per railway employee in relation to redundancy. That is something that is well known by those who know something about the industry. Anybody who would want to take over the workers who are currently employed would not necessarily want to take those employees over with that redundancy liability in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, what is going to in fact occur, I believe, is that a lot of these railway workers will get a redundancy and the very next day be re&hyphen;employed. Therefore, those railway workers will be very well looked after and their local regional communities will have the extra injection of funds into those communities through, on average, $55,000 per employee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also criticised for the environmental clean&hyphen;up. It stands to reason that if you pass over a business to private enterprise then the environmental liability has to be looked after as well. We in Tasmania have the former <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6142"> Inveresk rail yard. That was part of the Labor Party's better cities program which we have honoured and committed ourselves to. Part of the problem when we started developing the site was the environmental clean&hyphen;up, as I am sure Senator O'Brien would acknowledge, because past practices were not environmentally sound. We have made provision for that as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does not matter how the Labor Party seeks to address this problem. The reality is that AN was in a mess. It was getting worse by the day and we have taken the tough decision to clean up the rail system for the benefit of all Australians, particularly for the rail workers whose futures were in doubt and who will now be secure because of the restructuring that we propose.</PARA></ANSWER>

This is another flawed decision by the government. The Minister for Transport and Regional Development last Sunday referred to the New South Wales government's shareholding in National Rail as a barrier to selling that body. He did not mention the barrier to selling off the whole of the Tasmanian operation of AN, which is known as TasRail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On Sunday, his officials were telling the media that the Tasmanian tracks and rolling stock would most likely be sold. But I see in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS> that the state government has a quite different view. That view is based upon the Railways (Transfer to Commonwealth) Act 1975, which is an act of the Tasmanian parliament enacted as part of the agreement for the transfer of the Tasmanian railways to the Commonwealth.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a couple of points I would like to address on the Australian National issue. They mostly arose out of what Senator Foreman had to say in his delivery on this matter. He made two points. One was that there was an unnecessary $50 million going into an environmental clean&hyphen;up fund or sinking fund&mdash;whatever you would like to call it&mdash;and the other was that the trading figures are lessened. But the fact is that the figures allow for depreciation. As most senators in this chamber who have been in business, and those who have not been in business, should know, two principles stand out: to keep a successful business running&mdash;if you want to keep it moving and not let it run into liquidation&mdash;you allow for depreciation and also any contingent liabilities.</PARA></TALK.START>

In Kalgoorlie, for instance, there is a lot of National Rail land that is not being used by National Rail any more. Because of the efficiencies that exist in rail systems, you do not need the land that you used to need some time back. Whether it is going to be retained by National Rail in the public domain or sold off as an ongoing situation, some clean&hyphen;up does have to occur. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Of course, if it is sold off as an ongoing situation and if the $50 million is not in the sinking fund, that will depress the price of the sell off. So you just cannot get away from that $50 million. It is there. If you do not allow for it when you sell off, that is $50 million less you are going to get for your business.

<STATE> (South Australia)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(3.39 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will start with a couple of quotations. The first one is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not an overstatement to say that the system of administering justice is in crisis. Ordinary people cannot afford to enforce their rights or to litigate to protect their immunities. To that extent, the coercive force of the law is undermined.</PARA>
<PARA>This grim prognosis of the state of our legal system is not mine. The words are those of the Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, Sir Gerard Brennan, and they come from a speech he gave earlier this year to the Australian Institute of Judicial Administration in Wellington. His Honour's views on the consequences of the decisions made by the current government also make sombre reading. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The settlement of disputes by legal process is a fundamental function of government in a society under the rule of law. If the function is not performed, the law is not applied and the festering sore of injustice spreads the infection of self&hyphen;help. Power is then unrestrained by law. Peace and order are at risk and, sometimes, tragedy may be the consequence. Laws that are put on the statute book mock the integrity of the political process unless the beneficiaries of those laws can enforce them.</PARA>
<PARA>Let us put this crisis into perspective. At no time in recent political history has an Australian government made such a sustained attack on the right of access by ordinary Australians to our legal system. All in all, the federal <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6146"> budget contained some $320 million worth of measures that will deny many tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of Australians access to justice. The most obvious of these are the dramatic cuts in legal aid funding and the imposition of unnecessarily high court fees. But the government has also cut a raft of smaller measures that, in their own way, will have just as devastating an effect on access to justice. To get it into perspective, the government has cut back twice the amount of money provided by Labor in last year's much lauded Justice Statement. It is a breach of commitment. Before the election, the coalition promised to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . match and extend Labor's commitment to access to justice measures . . . We make a commitment to . . . the achievement of a justice system that is accessible to all Australians, regardless of their means.</PARA>
<PARA>More specifically, in the case of legal aid, the coalition promised:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Liberal and National Government will maintain current levels of legal aid funding and funding to community legal centres.</PARA>
<PARA>Those promises are now worthless. The breach of those promises will have real and devastating consequences in relation to the fundamental rights that should be enjoyed by all Australians. As the Chief Justice stated, and I think we should all agree, `access to justice is a fundamental function of government in a society under the rule of law'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first and most devastating cut has been to legal aid funding: some $120 million over three years, commencing in July 1997. Most importantly, the Commonwealth has also stated that from July next year none of the legal aid funding to be provided by the Commonwealth will be allowed to be spent on matters other than those arising under Commonwealth law. That in itself is grave enough; but it gets even worse. At a Senate estimates committee hearing, the Secretary to the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department, Mr Skehill, admitted that not all matters arising under Commonwealth law would receive funding and that priority would be given to some matters over others. He also refused to elaborate on what those priorities would be. To go even further, when asked, Mr Skehill said: </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decision to reduce the funding</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and to make it available only for expenditure on matters arising under Commonwealth law is non&hyphen;negotiable.</PARA>
<PARA>This decision is contrary to reports of and evidence provided at inquiries undertaken over the years. It flies very much in the face of some 26 years of practice in this country for the Commonwealth government to assume responsibility for a whole raft of matters and to provide funding to states for matters arising under state laws. This decision has been made by the government without consultation, without review and without any understanding of its implications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there had been a broader review and a more systematic approach taken to this, the government would have overcome some enormous problems. For instance, they would have overcome the problem they faced at a meeting with state and territory attorneys&hyphen;general on 25 October this year at which they not only slammed the federal government's decision but also basically indicated that the whole structure of legal aid in this country is being threatened by the Commonwealth government's unilateral decision to review funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To compound the irrationality of this decision, at that meeting the Commonwealth Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) admitted that the figures upon which the Commonwealth had based its decision were flawed. Yet, he publicly refused to announce that he would reconsider the decision or even the level of funding involved. This is not just a case of a lack of review or lack of recognition of need, but also an admission by the Commonwealth government that they messed it up. Even after that admission, they made no undertaking to go back and review the mistake they had made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do have a crisis here. The crisis we have in Australia is not just in respect of the legal aid system. It is also in respect of the whole legal system, as Chief Justice Brennan made clear. These cuts are already having devastating consequences, particularly for migrants, the unemployed, recipients of pensions, students, veterans, the disabled and victims of human rights abuses. They will all <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6147"> find it much more difficult, if not impossible, to receive justice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Law Council of Australia held a forum in the old Parliament House this morning and they had representatives of all sectors of the community from just about all over Australia. It is a pity that members of the government were not there to hear some of the problems currently faced by the legal aid system. That forum agreed to a communique, which stated that the participants call upon the government to meet with a delegation to hear first-hand of community concerns.</PARA>
<PARA>This has not happened as yet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the participants call upon the government to recommit to the concept of provision of legal aid as an essential element in providing access to justice and acknowledge the adverse consequences to other government expenditure of cuts to legal aid. That point acknowledges that legal aid is essential not as charity but as a right in our society and also reflects the fact that many of the savings here are going to be false savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, the participants also call on the government to recommit to the principle of equality before the law. As Mr Peter Short, the President of the Law Council of Australia, said this morning, equality before the law has been something we have been fighting for since the Magna Carta. We should not give up the fight now because of financial restraint.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The communique also calls on the federal government to reverse the decision to cut legal aid funding and to enter into meaningful discussions and negotiations with the states and territories to ensure that legal aid in the Commonwealth of Australia is appropriately funded; in other words, to show some leadership and assume the responsibility that for 2&half; decades at least some governments in this country have taken and assumed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was one particular aspect of this morning's proceedings that I would like to dwell on now, that is, the role and the rights of women and the plight of women as a consequence of this decision. They were stressed amongst all other problems that will flow from this decision. In particular, the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> speaker from the National Women's Justice Coalition, Judy Harrison, made the point that some 100,000 women would be directly affected by these decisions taken by the federal government&mdash;as I say, decisions that were taken without consultation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will not just be women affected by matters arising under state provisions for domestic violence but those seeking justice in terms of criminal injury compensation, those involved in de facto property settlements, those involved in acts of discrimination against them under state law, those claiming compensation, those involved in credit and consumer rights issues, those involved in tenancy issues and those who will be declined assistance in family law because of the necessary decline in available funding. Children will also be affected. All these areas will be affected by the government's decision to cut back funding in this area. We are talking about 100,000 women directly affected and we are talking about a part of our community which report after report has recognised as being treated unfairly by our justice system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister himself is committed to reducing incidents of domestic violence. This government, when in opposition before the election, acknowledged that women are treated unequally in terms of the legal system and that there is an imbalance in the legal aid system with respect to women. This decision by this government will more deeply affect the rights of women and basically accentuate the imbalance that is in the system now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Judy Harrison said that 30 per cent of recipients of grants in the legal aid system are women. But let us take into account that they are more often than not victims of domestic violence. The cuts will put women's safety at risk. Indigenous women have domestic homicide rates at appallingly high levels, but ATSI funding is not enough. The legal aid system discriminates against women, as the ALRC has determined in its most recent report. All these matters were matters raised this morning, and it is a pity that the government was not there to hear them. I am glad we have been able to bring them to the Senate this afternoon.</PARA>

<STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(3.49 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me say at the outset that this government continues to honour the sentiments outlined in its pre-election commitments to legal aid funding. Let us just go back to the policy document and remind ourselves of what the coalition committed itself to. What it said it would do is increase the extent to which legal aid is granted in civil proceedings, particularly in the family area, and explore ways of ensuring equity in the allocation of legal assistance and in devising new and innovative ways of ensuring that all Australians are able to access the court system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that statement the coalition went on to recognise that governments simply do not have adequate funds to assist those who want and merit legal assistance. Consequently, alternative solutions need to be found. In that statement the coalition was alluding to the fact that, prior to the election, funding for legal aid was a problem, that obviously not everybody who wanted or needed legal aid could be funded. That is simply a fact of life. This government has in no way turned itself away from the fact that all are equal before the law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since coming to government in March this year this government discovered the $8 billion black hole which needed to be addressed. So legal aid, just like all other areas of government funding, had to experience a cutback. The government also became aware that the existing legal aid agreements with the states were no longer appropriate. It has been some 10 years since these agreements were looked at and they needed to be renegotiated. The government is currently in the process of renegotiating those agreements. For Senator Bolkus to say that the government is not talking to the states is quite simply not true.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also not true to say that the cuts are having drastic consequences because the cuts have not yet taken place. In fact the cuts that have been mentioned do not take place until the next financial year. Any cuts or any lack of legal aid funding now is as a result of the previous government's decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also take issue with Senator Bolkus on another matter, that the government is not <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> consulting. The Senate legal and  constitutional committee, of which Senator Bolkus is a member, is looking at a wide ranging reference into legal aid and the government is also undertaking a detailed study of legal aid. That study is to be completed by December this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But let us look at the undertaking the coalition made in relation to civil and family law. We need only look back at the figures to see that between 1990&hyphen;91 and 1994&hyphen;95 Commonwealth funding for legal aid increased by 6.3 per cent in real terms. Over the same period, the number of approved applications for assistance in family law matters funded by legal aid commissions fell by 19 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although the Commonwealth was expending more money on legal aid, we had a decrease in funding for family law matters. Therefore, the Commonwealth was not getting value for its legal aid dollar. So the Commonwealth decided that it should fund only legal aid matters. That would thereby ensure an increase in funding for family law matters. That, of course, is what was stated in the coalition's election policy. There is absolutely no question of the government failing to honour any commitment in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the fiscal environment in which we find ourselves, which was inherited from the previous government, it is only proper to allocate costs between the Commonwealth and the states as needed. Senator Bolkus has referred to various jurisdictions which are state matters&mdash;such things as de facto relationships, restraining orders, courts of petty sessions and largely criminal matters. The Commonwealth is saying the states can take care of state matters and the Commonwealth will take care of Commonwealth matters. Indeed, the Commonwealth is currently responsible for providing more than 50 per cent of funding for legal aid commissions and provides additional funding to legal aid commissions for child support matters, war veterans' matters and criminal cases arising under the Commonwealth law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6149"> The Commonwealth's priorities for assistance are largely in the areas of family and civil law. These are the matters that I men tioned earlier were stated in the coalition policy. The Commonwealth has therefore, for all intents and purposes, been subsidising the states and territories for matters which have largely been in the state jurisdiction. The Commonwealth, as I said, has determined that in future it will fund only Commonwealth matters. Of course, funding levels for those Commonwealth matters will be maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition has said a lot in relation to legal aid, mainly portraying doom and gloom. The government does not shy away from the fact that we could always spend more money on legal aid. I am a great proponent of the legal aid system in this country. I believe the legal aid commissions we have in various states function very well, and any cut in this area has to be made with a great deal of thought and care. It is not something the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) relishes, but it is a fact of life that we cannot spend money that we do not have. People do not rely on Bankcard for their household finances. To do so would be irresponsible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a duty, not only to this generation but to forthcoming generations, to put Australia's finances in order. If we continue to go down the slippery slide the previous government was going down, in years to come we simply will not have a legal aid system. We have a legal aid system that we can be proud of, one which I think no other country can boast. But if we are to keep it we have to be financially responsible now and we have to look to the future. If we look after the money now, we will be able to extend into those areas which need attention in later years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is negotiating these legal aid agreements with various state governments. The government has maintained that it will fund only Commonwealth matters, but negotiations are still on foot. Senator Bolkus has implied that the door has closed, but that is simply not so. Over the forthcoming months the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee will be looking at the reference into legal aid which I mentioned earlier. The national legal aid conference held today was attended by representatives from the government. I think Mr Reaburn, the first <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> assistant secretary of the department, was there with other officers. So the government did have representation at that conference today. The government will look at the comments and submissions made at that conference, as will the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has acted responsibly and has approached this matter with great care. It does not make any cutback with any relish whatsoever. I do not believe that we will in any way be facing the abrogation of equality before the law that Senator Bolkus makes out.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps I can begin by correcting Senator Ellison. Commissions have had to make cuts now because some cases can run over two budgetary periods and they cannot take the risk that cases at hand will run out of money. So it does not mean that the cuts to come have not had an immediate effect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats support what Senator Bolkus has put forward for discussion as a matter of public importance. We strongly believe that the federal government should retain responsibility for funding legal aid. First, and most obviously, the coalition parties made a pre-election promise to maintain funding for legal aid. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Law and Justice</EMPHASIS>, the government's key policy document, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a Liberal and National Government will: maintain current levels of legal aid funding and funding to community legal aid centres.</PARA>
<PARA>You have broken that promise. The principles behind this, the document goes on to say, are that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the maintenance of the rule of the law is basic to our democratic system. The fundamental tenets of the Liberal and National Parties' approach to law and justice are, amongst other things, that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> all people should be equal before the law;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> all people regardless of status or financial means should have the ability to access the law;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the law must be accessible</PARA>
<PARA>I think you have broken those promises as well. Has the government changed its mind? Is this merely rhetoric? Cutting $120 million from legal aid over the next three years certainly will not guarantee that all people are equal before the law and will not guarantee that all people will have access to the law <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6150"> and/or to justice regardless of their economic circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this government's economic policies guarantee is that those who are extremely rich will have access to justice. The majority of Australians will be denied access to the law and to justice simply because they will not be able to afford it. Secondly, access to justice is a crucial component of a functioning participatory democracy. Could we imagine our country denying a person access to justice simply because they were unable to afford it? Each and every citizen has a right to access the legal system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, the Democrats contend that cases funded by legal aid should play a role in the funding of test cases. We say that test cases are those cases which are never likely to proceed to court. They are often cases involving high degrees of risk, as they involve issues never before tested in the courts, yet they are of crucial importance in testing the ability of the judicial system to adapt and change. In most instances, solicitors and barristers will take on cases in which they are likely to receive a deferred payment but are less likely to take on a case on a speculative basis. Legal aid is therefore vital to cases that might otherwise never go to court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fourthly, the access to justice reports all refer to the importance of legal aid for the special needs of disadvantaged groups. I quote from the access to justice action plan:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most obvious barrier [to justice] is the financial one. This, of course, affects many people in the community, especially in times of high unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA>The Law Council of Australia's national summit on legal aid was held today. The following facts were noted by distinguished speakers, including Ms Judy Harrison, spokesperson for the Women's Justice Coalition; Graeme Evans, of the Australian Council of Social Services; Helen Bayes, national convener for the Defence of Children International; and the Reverend Harry Herbert, the general secretary of the Uniting Church Board of Social Responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here are some facts. It has been estimated that 60,000 people will miss out on legal aid next year. Probably less than 15 per cent of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australians currently have access to legal aid. Last year in Western Australia, 70 per cent of the people who applied for legal aid were denied it, and that is under the old system. The section of the Attorney-General's Department that administers legal aid received a 6.6 per cent pay increase. There have been cases reported of adolescent children having to interpret for their mothers in protection applications where there has been domestic violence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Access to legal aid is decided on two bases: a means test and a `worthiness' test, which involves a subjective analysis of the case. Presently, for someone to qualify for full legal aid, they have to be earning less than $128 per week. The cuts will have a disastrous effect upon women in domestic violence situations. On the other side of the coin, because of the High Court's decision in the Dietrich case, serious criminals will not proceed to trial without representation. Because of the decision in re Kay, important custody, access and protection issues may not proceed with regard to children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part of living in a democracy means having a vital and well funded judiciary. Legal aid is an integral component in gaining access to justice for those most disadvantaged in our society. Without it, the law becomes a farce. Without legal aid, more indigenous people will end up in custody. Figures revealing the increasing number of deaths in custody released this week are very sobering. Does the government really want to be responsible for ensuring that more and more indigenous Australians end up in gaol cells or at the coroner's court?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Something else has now come to our attention. We have just been informed of federal cutbacks to the corporate watchdog, the ASC. With regard to the Australian Securities Commission, the Western Australian Director of Public Prosecutions, John McKechnie QC, said that this area of cutbacks will result in the advancement and support of white collar crime. This illustrates the same point as those mentioned earlier with regard to legal aid cutbacks. When governments remove the mechanisms that are designed to make the public and private sector <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6151"> accountable, they create a vacuum in which corruption can prosper and grow. We saw this in Western Australia in the 1980s with WA Inc. This recent move by the federal government sets the pace for similar public corruption. Political parties who weaken government accountability are just as culpable as subsequent governments or previous ones that have corrupt elements within them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How about a few more facts. Lawyers of various types in this country number 40,732. There are 683 QCs and SCs and 767 judges. Fifty-one out of 224 MPs in this parliament are lawyers&mdash;that is 23 per cent&mdash;but half of the cabinet are lawyers. That makes for an awful lot of approbating and reprobating. I say about this government that you do not have to be conservative to lack imagination. You are doing nothing to attack the cost of justice or provide vision in this area. Forcing all people out of the public purse, which is legal aid, into the private pockets of the law firms is not good for this country.</PARA></SPEECH>

I have myself been told by North Broken Hill, for example, that everything said by the Wilderness Society was being vetted by four QCs.

This service provides legal advice, a duty solicitor and legal representation, phone advice and valuable community education for the people of Tasmania.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the lead-up to the federal election the coalition promised to `match and extend Labor's commitment to access to justice measures'. That was in the coalition's policy document entitled `Law and justice for all of us'. But it would appear that that is just another of the coalition government's broken promises, or shall we refer to them as non-core promises?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It appears that the intent of this government is to reduce the level of access to justice measures. It appears that the coalition government intends to renege on its commitment to `the achievement of a justice system that is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6152"> accessible to all Australians, regardless of their means'. That was in the same statement. This comes as no surprise for it seems to me that the coalition is committed to reneging on nearly all of the commitments it made to maintaining services, particularly in my state of Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to refer senators to the February 1996 Liberal and National parties' law and justice policy. This policy states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Liberal and National government will maintain current levels of legal aid funding as well as funding to community legal centres. In government we will:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> examine ways, in consultation with the Legal Aid Commissions, of increasing the extent to which legal aid is granted in civil proceedings, particularly in the family law area; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> explore ways of ensuring equity in the allocation of legal assistance and in devising new and innovative ways of ensuring that all Australians are able to access the court system.</PARA>
<PARA>That was February. By June this year, not four months later, the situation had changed. On 28 June this year the Commonwealth Attorney-General (Mr Williams) gave notice to all Australian legal aid commissions that contracts for funding would have to be renegotiated effective from 1 July 1997. The standard Commonwealth government contribution is 55 per cent of the total government contribution. In Tasmania the Commonwealth contribution is 60 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many reasons why Tasmania receives a slightly higher level of funding. I would like to take the opportunity now to discuss those reasons. Forty-five thousand Tasmanian people access legal aid in all areas of the law every year. These clients are able to access services only after completing a strict assets and income test. Over 80 per cent of persons granted legal aid in Tasmania are in receipt of some form of Commonwealth benefit. Tasmania has 15 per cent more people receiving Commonwealth benefits than the Australian average. I rely upon the `Australian demographic statistics' of December 1995 from the Australian Bureau of Statistics for those statistics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tasmania is also in the unenviable position of having the highest unemployment level of any state. This is from the same statistics. The <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> average income for Tasmanians is the lowest in the country. The average weekly income for a Tasmanian family is $620 compared with the New South Wales average of over $740. That is from the Australian Bureau of Statistics `Household expenditure and characteristics by state' statistics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of this means that there are more Tasmanians who qualify for legal aid. The stated intention of the Attorney-General to place emphasis on Commonwealth law matters, rather than people for whom the Commonwealth has a special responsibility, will lead many pensioners and other benefit recipients to be without a safety net if legal problems arise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further complication for Tasmanian people is the high level of decentralisation. More than half of the Tasmanian population live outside the capital city. This is the highest level of decentralisation of any state in the nation. To effectively service this decentralised population, Tasmania is required to have four branches of legal aid services. People living outside capital cities should not suffer in terms of access to service. If Tasmania is to receive equitable funding, there must be a realisation of the special hardships facing the people of Tasmania, and the previous arrangements recognise those.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet despite the additional difficulties that Tasmania faces in terms of provision of legal aid services, Tasmania still manages to have one of the highest levels of service in the country. It is a fast, effective service with sound management. Any reduction in funding could put this effective service at risk. Regional Tasmania has already seen the closure of CES branches and the closure of family law courts, both services that the coalition promised to maintain. The people of Tasmania cannot continue to have their services slashed by this government without effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has long claimed that he is here for the battlers&mdash;that he must demonstrate a commitment to the battlers of Australia. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is an important signal from the Liberal Party to the rest of the Australian community of just how important it is for us to demonstrate a commitment <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6153"> to the entire Australian community. To demonstrate a commitment to the battlers of Australian society.</PARA>
<PARA>He said that in a post&hyphen;budget address in Sydney on 16 May. I would like to tell the Prime Minister that those battlers that he claims to represent in Tasmania are not going to see the attack on their legal aid service as a demonstrated commitment. It is a clear breach of coalition policy, it is an even clearer of breach of the coalition's election promises and it is a blatantly clear message to the people of Tasmania that their needs are irrelevant to this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 14 August this year the Prime Minister, in an interview on Sydney radio 2UE, was asked about the reactions that the battlers would be having after the budget. The Prime Minister answered:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, the battler will be saying; Howard kept his faith . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I ask the government to demonstrate that they intend to keep faith with the people who rely on the legal aid service and to honour their pre-election commitment to maintain funding levels for legal aid, because if they do not, they will stand condemned.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is to be expected that all of us who are concerned about access to justice for those in need in the community will express concern at any perceived threat to reduction in the availability of legal aid. The proposals put forward by the government, however, deserve constructive and careful consideration before reaction degenerates into hysteria, false alarm and exaggerated predictions about the number of people directly affected now or likely to be affected by adjustments which have not yet come into effect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In essence, the changes that the government have announced will ensure that legal assistance for matters arising under the Commonwealth law will be maintained, and the states and territories will assume responsibility for legal aid arising under their own state and territory laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now, there is nothing sinister about this decision. The Commonwealth decision has been prompted by the disproportionate amount of funding which has been applied by the states and territories to meeting demands <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for legal aid in state law matters, such as criminal trials, at the expense of Commonwealth matters such as family law, child support, eligibility for benefits under Commonwealth laws such as pension matters and aid for war veterans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth, very simply, is removing an unjustified subsidy to the states and territories for their own legal matters. It is simply unacceptable and unfair to those needing legal aid in our community to deal with Commonwealth laws and matters when, in circumstances that currently prevail, state funding and administration by state legal aid commissions take an unfair amount of the funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth has estimated that around $33 million of the $150 million appropriated by the Commonwealth for legal aid is currently diverted from Commonwealth matters and is being applied to state and territory law matters, predominantly criminal trials. But as well as getting Commonwealth funding, the states and territories are able to access further moneys from the statutory interest on solicitors' trust accounts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the extent of Commonwealth funding to the states and the use of the statutory interest on solicitors' trust accounts, the states have been able to reduce their contributions to legal aid to an unacceptably low percentage of the legal aid bill. It is high time that the states and territories faced up to funding their own fair share in the provision of legal aid to the needy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is ironic indeed that Senator Bolkus is the mouthpiece today&mdash;and Senator O'Brien&mdash;of the outrage at the Commonwealth's proposals to bring proper balance and fairness into the distribution of legal aid in this country. How can it be fair that people with family law, associated domestic violence problems and other Commonwealth disputes are squeezed out, unable to get assistance to deal with Commonwealth laws, because the legal aid commissions in each state have been able to spend most of their funds on state and territory criminal matters? Where is the fairness in that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6154"> After all, it was the late former Senator Lionel Murphy who, in 1973, used the consti tutional device of designating certain categories of persons as having sufficient connection with the Commonwealth to attract Commonwealth funding and established the Australian Legal Aid Office. Those categories&mdash;pensioners, migrants, students, service men and women and Aborigines&mdash;had hitherto been assisted by the private legal profession funded by interest on the statutory trust accounts in each state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All that is now proposed is that, where these categories of eligible persons have a Commonwealth law problem, the Commonwealth will fund them; where they have a state law matter, the states and territories will be expected to fund aid. An exception is the abolition of the separate Aboriginal Legal Service, recently so much criticised in connection with failure to adequately represent indigenous people, and the transfer of that funding to the state and territory legal aid commissions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Murray is not here to hear this, but that may do something constructive to assist with the appalling toll of Aboriginal deaths in custody. The current system is certainly not helping them. Senator Murray also mentioned need for a bit of vision. How is this for a bit of vision? One may ask, why not take this opportunity to reconsider the whole gamut of legal aid services and how those services are funded? It is not as though the current legal aid system has worked so efficiently that it should be immune from creative and new ideas to deal with this most fundamental of rights&mdash;access to justice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a legal aid industry out there with practitioners dependent on legal aid funding to maintain their professional practices. These circumstances provide an ideal opportunity for the state legal aid commissions to introduce some innovative practices and efficiencies into this industry. A recent call by the Queensland Legal Aid Commission for tenders from the private profession to undertake trial work in blocks of criminal cases in Brisbane, Cairns and Southport has the potential to introduce competition and to hold down costs in legal aid work. New South Wales has also indicated a willingness to try tendering. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A franchise system similar to that operating in the United Kingdom is being tried in Victoria. Legal firms meeting audit requirements are eligible to tender for work, at set prices. Obviously, it is too early to tell whether such innovations will be effective not only to deliver aid but also to deliver it in a cost-effective and responsible way. But the incentive is there and, if the states and territories meet their own responsibilities in their own jurisdictions, the total funding available to legal aid will remain. The point surely is that the current hit and miss system of legal aid funding and aid delivery is not adequately meeting its mark. The taxpayers' legal aid pocket is not a bottomless pit. It is an area which deserves our ongoing attention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In these recent proposals, the Commonwealth has taken the initiative of targeting responsibility for Commonwealth matters for those needing family law, child support and help with pension and benefit matters. It is time the states and territories were accountable for legal aid delivery for their own law and order matters. The dictates of fairness demand it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At risk here is a basic right for many people; that is, the right to access justice. If one looks at the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, I believe article 14 requires the Commonwealth government to provide legal assistance to people facing major charges, regardless of the Australian jurisdictional argument. I have heard that from the other side today. This concept, whilst it implies legal assistance, is not identical to legal aid. Nonetheless, Australia has traditionally provided assistance through legal aid mechanisms to those who are not in a position to defend themselves. The recipients invariably have been the poor, so why do we place this assistance in jeopardy now?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently, the Queensland government, along with others, threatened that if the Commonwealth proceeds with cuts, then they may go it alone and not provide the administrative structure to support the Commonwealth funding of its matters. Of course, the Commonwealth funding therefore would have to be found. To that extent, the administration of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6155"> just the Commonwealth scheme itself is estimated to be about 12 per cent of the current funding budget. Nationally, it would be $12 million. In Queensland terms, it would be $2 million. It would be money which would be taken out of the pool of funds available for legal aid in either my state of Queensland or nationally throughout Australia. That, of course, is a system which would be completely untenable for the poor people of this nation who want legal defence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth has never kept statistics of those who are covered by Commonwealth law or those who are Commonwealth persons. No&hyphen;one really knows therefore what the end result of the proposed cuts by the government will be. It is no idle threat by the Queensland government that it will distance itself from the federal government. Already, I believe, the same Queensland state government has gone down the path of setting up a separate human rights office from the Commonwealth because of a funding dispute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been a few hoary chestnuts put out today by the government. If one looks particularly at the issue of Commonwealth funding, one finds that, on 25 October this year, the Attorneys&hyphen;General from the various states issued a media release which says `Commonwealth snubs needy Australians in a broken legal aid electorate promise'. I will quote some excerpts from that media release because it really gets to the nub of what this argument is about. These people are predominantly from the conservative side of politics. They say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth's efforts to rip $33 million out of Legal Aid (nearly a third of the current Commonwealth funding) is clearly a major broken election promise by the federal coalition.</PARA>
<PARA>Their own kind is saying that it is a broken promise. In their media release they go on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rather than improving access to justice, we are all concerned that the Commonwealth's commitment to access to justice for those unable to otherwise afford it is being seriously eroded. This decision is not about better utilising money, it is about taking that money away. It is a straight budget cut.</PARA>
<PARA>As I said, that is from Attorneys&hyphen;General who predominantly do not come from this side of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> politics. In the media release they went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now those people will be left without representation by the Commonwealth's budget cut. All the promises before the election of consultation with Legal Aid Commissions, better funding for access to justice and a secure future for Legal Aid have been jettisoned for little more than a budget saving. Legal aid is a social issue and not just a legal measure. Legal aid is provided to assist those people in society who need help.</PARA>
<PARA>That is precisely what this argument is about: helping those people who can least defend themselves&mdash;something that the people on the government side do not understand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The annual report of the Legal Aid Commission of Queensland for 1994&hyphen;95 shows the number of people who were helped and their income brackets. According to the report, 72.4 per cent of the applicants rely on pensions and benefits for their income; and the average weekly income of pensioners and beneficiaries is $217.74. The report shows that 20 per cent of the applicants had cash or money assets in banks and building societies. What about the other 80 per cent? One can only assume that they had nothing in banks or building societies. The average amount for those who did have assets was $826.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report shows the housing situation for those people. It tells us that 36 per cent of the applicants rented accommodation at an average weekly rent of $97; only five per cent owned or were purchasing their own homes; and the average weekly mortgage payment was $136. These are the true Aussie battlers. These are the people whom the government pretends to represent. These are the people who are being thrown aside by this savage cut to funding for legal aid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you go further into the report, you find that the number of applicants with no income rose from 10 per cent to 15 per cent in 1993&hyphen;94. As to the extent of the funding, one only has to look at the extent to which the funding is used throughout Queensland, particularly rural Queensland. The reports lists civil cases as: Bundaberg, 24; Cairns, 10; Ipswich, 9; Maroochydore, 11; Toowoomba, 52; and Townsville, 11. The number of people is not large, but they are people who would be affected by this decision. The report <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6156"> also lists family cases as: Bundaberg, 17; Cairns, 24; Mt Isa, 20; Toowoomba, 47; and Townsville, 39. The numbers, whilst not great, are significant. They are people who find that their backs are to the wall. This is all from a government that pretends to represent the battler. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon we are discussing a matter of public importance raised by Senator Bolkus, which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The failure of the Government to honour its pre&hyphen;election commitment to maintain funding for legal aid.</PARA>
<PARA>I think every single Australian knows by now that the biggest failure of any party to honour a pre&hyphen;election commitment was when the Labor government, under Mr Beazley, the then Minister for Finance, promised that the budget was in surplus. When we came to power we found that, rather than the budget being in surplus, it was in fact in deficit by $8 billion. If the Labor Party want to cry crocodile tears about the cuts we have to make, they should have thought about that before they overspent. In fact, they remind me of the spouse who takes the family pay packet to the pub and then complains when the car is repossessed. They say that the family ought to have a car; that the family is entitled to have a car. Sure, the family ought be entitled to have a car, but it can no longer afford it if all the money got spent in the pub.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, with the Labor Party, over 13 years they virtually bankrupted this country, and we now have to make some very tough decisions. The promise we made before the election was on the basis of the promise by the then Minister for Finance, Mr Beazley, with hand on heart, that the budget was in surplus. That clearly was not correct. I will not say that it was a lie because that is unparliamentary, but I think the people of Australia have made their decision as to whether or not the truth was told by Mr Beazley and the Australian Labor Party. We made our promises in good faith on the basis of the Labor Party's promise about the state of the budget. That clearly was not the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Time and time again we have these discussions in the Senate about the government not <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> keeping pre-election promises. Then we are told about the devastation being caused within the community because somehow we are unable to match the promises that we made. It is a bit like an arsonist standing by complaining about the water damage being done by the fire brigade, taking no responsibility for his action and for the real damage that has been caused, but standing by saying, `Look at these terrible fire people. In putting out the fire they are causing a bit more water damage.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we did not put out the financial fire in this country, there would be no legal aid, there would be no social security for anybody because the totality of this country would be bankrupt. Yet they have the audacity to come into this chamber and suggest that it has nothing to do with them. The cuts that this government has to implement is a direct result of their overspending over a period of 13 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I seek to make a few comments in relation to previous contributions. In question time Senator Bolkus spoke about increased lawlessness with cuts to legal aid. I confess that, whilst I was practising full time as a lawyer, I often did legal aid cases in the criminal area. I have to say, quite frankly, that a lot of people got the benefit of technicalities and other matters that let them out of gaol, when some casual observers might say that they should have been in gaol.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we want to talk about lawlessness, we are really talking about more money for the police rather than legal aid to defend people to keep them out of gaol to commit more lawless acts. I am not quite sure where Senator Bolkus got that terminology from, other than somebody from the legal aid area whose letter I did read. The assertion about lawlessness simply does not make sense. However, I do agree that it is a pity that we do not have enough money to fund legal aid to the extent that we might wish to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Murray made an emotional plea about deaths in custody of our indigenous people. I would have thought that anybody who wished to partake in this debate would have made themselves aware of the facts. The Aboriginal Legal Service is not funded out of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6157"> the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department but out of the department of Aboriginal affairs. So that was a complete furphy thrown in. It was a good emotional topic to try to latch on to but, as so often is the case with the Australian Democrats, is completely irrelevant to the topic that we are discussing today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Murray then commented about the cost of justice and this provision of money from legal aid to private firms in the event that we cut legal aid. Possibly he does not understand, but a substantial bulk of legal aid money goes to private firms because private firms, such as the ones I am associated with, do legal aid work on behalf of the legal aid commissions around this country. So it is not to put more money into the hands of private lawyers. In fact, these cutbacks will undoubtedly mean that private lawyers will get less from legal aid. So that argument can also be thrown out and has no substance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Brown made a very emotional plea about community activists. He talked about how they cannot get money, how they need legal aid and how the big corporations are able to get tax deductibility. Allow me to remind Senator Brown that, when he was up on police charges and was in fact convicted, the Coordinator of the Tarkine National Coalition sent this memo around. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Court defences are very costly and those who place themselves in this position are standing up for the environment and need our fullest support. The best way you can assist is to provide cash donations&mdash;any amount, $20 or more, whatever you can spare&mdash;to the fighting fund. Please forward your donations either direct to the Tarkine National Coalition or&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and wait for this&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">for tax deductibility through the Tasmanian Conservation Trust Inc. marked for the Tarkine campaign.</PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators would be aware that, under the terms of the gift provisions of the income tax law, a body seeking acceptance as a tax deductible environmental organisation must have a policy of not acting as a mere conduit for passing on donations to third parties. So perhaps Senator Brown ought to think again before he comes into this chamber high and mighty about tax deductibility, because he was involved in such a rort courtesy of Mr Peter Sims.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To conclude this debate on behalf of the government, the reality is that the cuts that have to be made are simply as a result of the Labor government's overspending.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think I am the last speaker of a fairly long list of speakers on this very important bill, the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 1996. The bill is designed to give effect to the government's commitments made during the election to liberalise the new schools policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have received many representations concerning this bill, both for and against the measure. In these circumstances I think it desirable for me to set down some of the basic principles at the outset, which should guide the Senate in the consideration of this <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6158"> measure. Reference has been made to these principles by other speakers, but some of the principles include, firstly, that it is the parents and not governments who have the primary right and responsibility in determining the education of their children; secondly, that governments have a right to insist that children be educated sufficiently to undertake their responsibilities as future citizens; and, thirdly, that there should be ready availability of quality free public primary and secondary education. I owe a considerable amount to my state school teachers, who gave me my grounding in a bush primary school. So I am very keen on ensuring that the third principle, as well as the first two, is kept firmly in mind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill recognises the first principle by removing Commonwealth restrictions in relation to Commonwealth funding for new schools and by adopting the principle that, where a child moves from one school system to another, federal funding should, to some extent, follow the student. This is supposed to be what the enrolment benchmark adjustment is designed to achieve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am aware that there has been criticism of the formula for calculating the savings which state governments may make when students move from a state funded school to a non-state funded school. I would be interested to hear from the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) during her wrap&hyphen;up of the second reading debate any responses the government may care to make on this particular criticism. It is perhaps a debate which cost accountants would understand better than most in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I see it, no-one can pretend that states do not save money when they have to educate fewer children. On the other hand, it is equally obvious that the savings the state may make from reduced enrolments may not be a smoothly graduated mathematical function of changes in enrolment. Clearly there are fixed costs in maintaining an existing school system, whether state or non-state, and average costs may not represent a proper measure of marginal cost savings. However, I do note that the government has not sought to recover <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> full average costs when enrolments change, but only 50 per cent of that is recovered in a later year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to be pejorative. It would be wrong to accuse states of cost shifting when all that is happening is that parents are exercising their right to place their children in different schools. However, it must be recognised that it is not unreasonable for the Commonwealth to apply and adopt a policy under which some Commonwealth funding follows the student.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In some of the discussions on the Commonwealth funding for schools, it seems to be forgotten that state schools get funding from both the Commonwealth and states, whereas non-state schools are much more dependent upon Commonwealth funding. Of course, this is a result of history. People will recall, for example, the Goulburn strike. I suppose, in many cases, it is also some sort of an expression of the powers of the Commonwealth, which are limited by the constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is misleading just to look at Commonwealth funding for state and non-state schools. I realise that there are fears that the adoption of this principle of Commonwealth funding following the student involves a risk of state schools being under&hyphen;funded. That is a matter that I have been directing my attention to, particularly over the last week or two.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some have suggested that the emergence of new non-government schools runs the risk of drawing away sufficient students from government schools so that they become less economic or even non-viable. I might say that I do not really share the view that this measure is going to attract students necessarily away from government schools. I do not even necessarily think&mdash;although the government appears to, from the figures supplied&mdash;that there will be a flow of students from state schools to non-state schools or that it is even going to be the volume that the government considers might occur, and that is not great.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note, however, that the bill provides for an overall increase in Commonwealth funding for schooling. The real question is whether the reduction in financial assistance grants to the states&mdash;the old tax reimbursement grants which arose from the Premiers Conference&mdash; <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6159">will have the effect of putting pressure on state education budgets. That is of concern, but the pressure on state and, indeed, federal budgets affects the funding of a whole range of activities, not just education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am in favour of improving education generally, and that is much more than a question of money. It involves broader issues, such as the training and status of the teaching profession, social attitudes on the value of education and, in particular, what value we attach to culture generally. However, this bill is about money. I think it quite reasonable, given the history of this particular matter, that Commonwealth funding for students should, to a certain extent, follow the student. If you are looking at the head of power in the constitution, that seems to be a fairly clear indication that that should be so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clear that there are major inequities in the present system where some children in some non-government schools receive no funding at all. If there is a concern that too many new schools will undermine the rational provision of education in the states, there is nothing in this legislation which prevents a state from re-examining its own criteria for school registration. That matter relates to the second principle which I briefly mentioned in the introduction to my contribution to this debate. If there is some concern that this bill will result in the mushrooming of small schools around the place which may in fact affect the quality of education generally then of course it is up to the states to ensure that they exercise their undoubted right which enables them to set criteria for school registration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems that there may be unnecessary fears being generated by some in the debate on school funding. As I understand it, the Commonwealth formula is even&hyphen;handed. If state schools attract more students into their schools, they will receive increased funding. In some states there have been examples of state schools establishing academic reputations more than equal to those of non-government schools and suffering from no lack of enrolments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that parents are not stupid and are not likely to move their children en <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> masse from good state schools. Those who fear a mass exodus from state schools as a result of this legislation are really saying that the state schools are so bad that no-one would want to send their children to them. I do not believe that such fears are well founded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that most parents, whether their children are at state or non-state schools, care about their children's education and are willing to work with their schools to improve or maintain the quality of their children's education. Parents do not lightly change their children's schools. They are well aware of the social and educational disruption that may result therefrom. In these circumstances, I am concerned that unnecessary alarm may be being generated throughout the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the final analysis, if we are concerned about equity and we do wish to respect parents' choices in the education of their children, we cannot argue over the basic principle of this bill if that is the view of the parliament. Whatever the intricacies of federal&hyphen;state tax sharing and expenditure sharing arrangements, these should not be allowed to cloud that essential principle of parental choice in regard to the education of their children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a whole range of government schools in existence. There are government schools, Anglican schools, Catholic schools, Jewish schools, Lutheran schools, Steiner schools and other schools. They are organised by different religious or community groups and are all functioning on different educational philosophies. I do not see it my business to tell parents that their choices are not legitimate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a multicultural society with a tolerance for differences of traditions, it is hard to argue that funding penalties should be imposed&mdash;in fact, that further funding penalties should be imposed&mdash;on those parents who may wish for different choices in the education of their children. I will therefore not be supporting the amendment that has been proposed to the bill. I am disinclined to support the amendments that are being proposed by the opposition, though we will be dealing with those in the committee stage of debate. I will be listening carefully to that.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6160">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a matter that I wish to raise which has not been raised in a substantial way in any of the speeches in the second reading stage. In fact, I am not sure that it was raised at all in any of those speeches. It relates to the recognition of parental choice in the education of children with special disabilities. It is an area with which I have had a long association&mdash;the area of care for persons with disabilities, both physical and intellectual.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At present, sometimes there is not much choice available for parents of children with special disabilities. Parents may know that they could get special education at a special school but have serious reasons for wanting a child to go to, say, a regular, non-government school&mdash;it is closer to home, where there is greater family and community support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have stated that the principle of the money following the student is reasonable. It is clearly even more important that, where there are special needs requiring a greater level of Commonwealth funding, students not be disadvantaged. I would therefore like to hear from the minister, during her speech in closing this debate, how this bill will affect the range of choices available to parents of children with disabilities and, in a more general sense, how the government is approaching that matter. I thank the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In closing this debate, I would like to respond to some comments that have been made by senators who have participated. I thank all senators for their contribution, even if I have not always agreed with what they have said.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me first refer to the last issue raised by Senator Harradine, which is the provision for children and students with disabilities. I would like to draw attention to the provision in the legislation for students with special learning needs. The government has recognised that there are students with particular needs and that that means they require additional help and resources to realise their full potential. This legislation ensures that the needs of these children will continue to be <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> addressed through the special learning needs program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular, students with disabilities continue to be a high priority for the government. This legislation will provide $92 million in 1997 specifically to assist students with disabilities. Changes to programs for students with disabilities in the non-government sector, undertaken through the broadbanding exercise, has meant that states and sectors have more flexibility to address the needs of those students with disabilities who are most in need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has also meant that the majority of non-government sectors across Australia have had an increase in special education assistance. I refer to those increases by state and sector: Queensland, $395,800 in the Catholic sector and $154,700 in the independent sector; Western Australia, $215,200 in the Catholic sector and $72,100 in the independent sector; in my own state of South Australia, $154,300 in the Catholic sector and $88,200 in the independent sector; and in Senator Harradine's state of Tasmania, $54,300 in the Catholic sector and $23,900 in the independent sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I move to some of the remarks made in this debate. I would like to turn first to some of the remarks of Senator Margetts. I believe that this matter does need to be cleared up, and Senator Margetts might like to come in during the committee stage and give us all an explanation. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, her contribution reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My office has received a call from the Emmaus Primary School here in Canberra, which has been encouraged and facilitated by the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs and the office of the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) to go ahead with their school plans as if the new schools policy was not in place.</PARA>
<PARA>She went on to say a few other things and then came to the point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This school I refer to sees the importance of the retention of the new schools policy and is not anti-NSP.</PARA>
<PARA>That is allegedly a fairly direct statement by Senator Margetts. I would now like to read a letter addressed to me from the Emmaus <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6161"> Christian School, signed by Mr Kim Gillis, the chairman. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to correct the statement made in the Senate this morning by Senator Dee Margetts of the Greens during the debate on the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Emmaus Christian School fully supports the government on this bill. Emmaus does not agree that the new schools policy should be continued, but rather that the respective state governments should provide mechanisms to ensure that new schools are both viable and educationally sound. You may wish to refer to our situation as being fairly representative of the sort of school that will be able to commence in 1997 if this bill is passed.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not need to read the rest of the letter; the point made is perfectly clear. Senator Margetts this morning referred to this school, told the Senate that the school sees the importance of the retention of the new schools policy and is not anti the new schools policy. I have a letter from the chairman of the school, who happened to be listening to the debate this morning, saying that the school completely supports the government and it does not agree that the new schools policy should be continued. I look forward to Senator Margetts's contribution later in the debate indicating how it is she came to an erroneous conclusion or deliberately misled the Senate&mdash;one or other is the case. She may have misunderstood. I do not assert that without hearing what she has to say.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me turn to some remarks made by Senator Carr, who claimed that the bill would abolish planned education provision, as I am advised. That is wrong. The responsibility for the planning of schools rests with state governments. It is the state governments which plan where government schools are placed. It is appropriate that they should have the responsibility for the regulation of non&hyphen;government schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand he further claimed that broadbanding of targeted programs would reduce the focus on the specific needs of individual students. Perhaps he does not understand that the government is concerned about the educational outcomes of students, not just the monetary inputs that he talks about. Broadbanding will provide not only <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> more flexibility but more equitable funding because the states will not be bound by endless red tape.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He claimed there was no accountability for Commonwealth money, as I am advised. For the first time the bill includes specific provisions for educational accountability, in clause 12. This government is committed to pressing both the government and the non&hyphen;government sector to ensure that educational accountability is paramount.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Carr, I understand, chose to quote from the UN Declaration of Human Rights, pointing out that everyone has the right to education&mdash;which is, of course, true. But he did not go on and quote the rest, which is that parents have a prior right to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their children. It perhaps says something about Senator Carr that he chose to leave that aspect out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of assertions have been made with respect to the bill. One is that the government favours non&hyphen;government schools. This is simply wrong. Taking into account both specific purpose payments and financial assistance grants, support for government school students, per capita, is increasing more rapidly than for non&hyphen;government school students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further suggestion is that the states are somehow going to reduce their funding to education as a result of the Premiers Conference. But, on the best available estimates we have, spending by states and territories for education through their budgets for 1996&hyphen;97 is estimated to increase by an average of about 6.4 per cent compared with 1995&hyphen;96. Far from the changes leading to a reduction and showing a lack of faith in the states, the information we have is that education spending by the states is increasing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the debate earlier today, Senator Bolkus claimed that $1.5 billion represented the total increase in Commonwealth schools funding from all sources, including FAGs, for the four years to 2000. I am advised that that is incorrect. The $1.5 billion is the increase in funding provided under this bill alone, even after the enrolment benchmark adjustment has been netted off.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6162">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am told that Senator Bolkus further claimed that nothing was known about the EBA until some considerable time after the budget. That may be so for people who did not bother to read the budget papers, but it is not true for those who did, and it is certainly not true for state and territory ministers, because information about the EBA was contained in Budget Paper No. 1 and, as I understand it, in DEETYA's portfolio budget statements. Indeed, my colleague Dr Kemp wrote to all state and territory ministers on 20 August, the day of the budget, setting out the budget outcomes for schools, including the introduction of the EBA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Allison made a number of references to Jewish day schools and some other religious denominations as being, as I understand it, fundamentalist and extremist.</PARA>

Funds for students with disabilities, newly arrived migrants requiring ESL instruction and students in country areas will continue to have identified allocations and those allocations must be spent in accordance with what they are intended to be spent on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Crowley, I understand, made a contribution indicating there was no evidence that people suffered under the new schools policy. This is clearly a misunderstanding on her part or a failure to look reality in the face. The new schools policy was unfair and discriminatory, and particularly so to poorer schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are currently 52 schools operating without any Commonwealth funding at all for their students and 38 schools caught by the category 6 funding restriction. That is, because of the new schools policy, 52 schools, so desperate were they to follow the choices of the parents, decided in any event that they would operate without Commonwealth funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that Senator Allison expressed concern that targeting for students with special needs would somehow become blurred under this legislation. As I think it has been indicated, the broadbanding provisions will not preclude specific targeting by sectors for those students with special needs. They provide greater flexibility for sectors to provide for those students most in need and address issues such as intersecting disadvantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Carr in his contribution, I understand, quoted a leaked document from what was referred to as a June ERC meeting, which was purported to represent the government's view on non-government schools. What Senator Carr did not mention was that this meeting took place in June 1991. Anything discussed at that meeting does not in any way represent the policy of the Howard government. I look forward to Senator Carr perhaps making some remarks about that when he comes to make a later contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Brown, in his contribution, implied that the main reason parents sent their children to non-government schools was more favourable pupil&hyphen;teacher ratios. This just does <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6163"> not fit the facts. The vast majority of non-government schools have a higher pupil&hyphen;teacher ratio than government schools. In 1994, the last year for which final figures are available, Catholic schools had an average of 20.3 to one for primary and 13.7 to one for secondary, while the government figures were less than that&mdash;18.3 students to one and 12.4 to one, respectively. Indeed, Catholic schools at best operate at 80 per cent of the resource levels available to government schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have not been able to address all the comments made in the debate. I think the ones I have referred to are ones that perhaps deserve some response and should be specifically referred to. As I say, I look forward to Senator Margetts coming in and giving an indication of where she went wrong with the Emmaus Christian School. In conclusion, I thank all  senators for their contribution to the debate.</PARA>

<PARA>The opposition moves these amendments because they deal with a fundamental problem we see with the legislation. I am glad Senator Harradine is here to participate in this debate, as he normally is conscientious when critical issues arise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can understand Senator Vanstone's frustration that she is caught in here at this particular moment while in South Australia the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6164"> Liberal Party is lining up for a meeting which will change the Premier of that state by 7 or 8 o'clock tonight. It is a pity for South Australia that they are going from Dean Brown to John Olsen. They should just cut out the middle man and go to Joan Hall. She has been running the game there for quite some time. It must be frustrating for you, Mr Temporary Chairman Chapman, and for Senator Vanstone to be caught in here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As expressed in the second reading debate, we are concerned about this legislation for a number of reasons, one of which is the flood of funds it will allow from one sector to the other. If people are concerned about choice in education, they should be concerned about the level of choice that will remain, as a consequence of this legislation, to those who are, for instance, in the government sector. We must remember that we do not talk here of finite resources. We must also remember that what we are dealing with here is a mechanism which will allow funds to go from one sector to the other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the second reading debate, I indicated that some $177 million was our estimation of the level of resources that would go from the government sector to the non&hyphen;government sector. The Democrats' figure is some $305 million. Whether it is one or the other, we are talking here of an enormous amount of money going from one sector to the other. The government says that reflects a number of students going from the government sector to the non&hyphen;government sector. There would be an allowance for each one of these. Senator Harradine said he was pleased that that allowance was only half of the average cost per student.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first point to make about that is that a marginal cost is quite different from not only an average cost but also half the average cost. The second point to make is that, in the period of this legislation, we are talking about a lot more students for the government sector as well. Population growth would indicate that there would be more students in the government sector. This legislation will ensure that the level of money that has been available up until now will not be available per student in the government sector.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you talk about choice and extending choice, you have to recognise here that, as was written to us a couple of days ago by the Australian Council of State School Organisations, `one parent's choice will be another parent's school closure'. That should be of critical concern to all of us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us remember that we are talking about at least $177 million going from the government sector to the non&hyphen;government sector by the operation of this benchmark. Let us also remember we are talking about more students in the government sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does that mean? When you have more students and fewer resources per head it is going to impact and it will impact in the traditional ways. It will mean that there will be less choice in terms of curriculum. It will also mean, particularly in rural areas, that governments will have less flexibility to accommodate the direct interests of regions or communities. It is going to impact somewhere and in a way that the students and parents who are in the government sector will be necessarily disadvantaged because of the restrictions placed on funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Harradine raised the question of disabled students and how they will be catered for. My understanding is that some 70 per cent of funding for disabled students goes to government schools. If those government schools are going to be left with fewer resources per student and to have almost $200 million milked out of them as a consequence of this benchmark, they will not have as much capacity to accommodate those with specific needs, not only because of reduced resources&mdash;and we have to recognise that those with disability do need extra resources&mdash;but also because the government is doing away with targeting of specific needs as one of its initiatives in this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before the election, the government promised that they would spend $6 million a year more to cater for those disabled students but that has not been delivered. When Senator Vanstone talks about the amount of money that will be spent on disabled students, she is not talking about the increase that they promised before the election. Let us make that very clear. She is talking about continuing levels <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6165"> of funds, but not the increase. When you take into account that you are not increasing funds and are going to have the government sector, which at the moment handles some 70 per cent of the funds for the disabled, cut back severely as a consequence of this legislation&mdash;and you are going to have more students&mdash;and if you are concerned about disabled students in our school system, you really have to be concerned about this legislation and the way that it opens up blank cheques in terms of some of the unwinding of requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Choice, as Professor Ken McKinnon said, is something that really needs to be taken into account and thought about seriously in the context of finite resources. His report, completed in February this year, debunks the very points that this government is making to justify its abolition of the policy. As he said, the notion of choice in education can be infinitely expanded and the establishment of non&hyphen;government schools in any circumstance automatically results in savings to the public purse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The two arguments used by the government are arguments that just do not hold water when you are talking about finite resources. That is why this government have sought to bury the McKinnon report. That is why they have not taken it into account. That report runs totally counter to the sorts of arguments and ideological inclinations that they are pursuing with this legislation. McKinnon debunked the government's primary arguments. They cannot run away from that. He debunked them to the extent of exposing that you cannot have the degree of choice this government is talking about, given the parameters and the finite resources we are talking about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that the abolition of the new schools policy formed part of the coalition's pre&hyphen;election policy announcements. But what was not explained before the election was how it would be funded, Senator Vanstone. The truth about how it would be funded is another reason why you have been pretty keen to bury the McKinnon report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The growth of the non&hyphen;government sector will be funded by the enrolment benchmark <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> adjustment and that adjustment is a permanent benchmark for the reduction of Commonwealth expenditure on government schools. This will result in some $177 million at least being taken out of the government school sector. The rationale for this extraordinary attack on the state school sector is, as I said earlier, the use of the mechanism of average costs and average costs indicating a saving to the state of $3,400 for each student in the non&hyphen;government sector, based on the proportion of public cost, in each case borne by the Commonwealth. You are going to rip $1,700 per capita for all future changes in the balance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">McKinnon found this approach flawed but he was not the only person who found problems with your direction. Most of the state governments before the Senate committee gave evidence to that committee's inquiry about the benchmark.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is probably best at this stage to place on record all the comments from Mr Christopher Taggart, the Director of Management Accounting at the New South Wales Department of School Education. He told the committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The state believes that you will not save at the average. You will not save across the school system entirely based on the average cost of that school system. You will not see a librarian, a head teacher, a principal, a deputy principal, the ancillary staff, my position, the Director General's position or state officer's position, changed. You will only ever see marginal changes in classroom numbers . . . Also, you will generally only see changes in the number of students in a particular class&mdash;one, two, three, four, depending on the school. You will not see whole schools disappear. You will not see the whole subject areas disappear. Therefore, to take all the school system, including the admin and executive structure of the school, as well as the state infrastructure and bend, delete or change it in any way is a nonsense. You will only see the change at the margins. Therefore, the DEET analysis&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this government's analysis&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is fundamentally flawed.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>Our amendment would prevent the government using this legislation to apply its enrolment benchmark adjustment. We believe that if you are going to make those adjustments and flick money from one sector to the other, you still have the option of doing that. How <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6166"> ever, we would rather you did it up-front with public debate and when you front the states and territories across the table at the Premiers Conference. That is the honest way to do it. It should not be done through the use of some benchmark formula which year by year ensures that money is siphoned off from one section to the other. We want you to be up-front and not use the sleight of hand that this formula will present. We are concerned here with the impact of this agenda, particularly because your formula and benchmark are flawed. The formula does not take into account the continuing, growing needs of the government sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Vanstone talked about an ERC meeting. The reference I made in this debate yesterday was to the leaked minutes of a coalition Expenditure Review Committee meeting on 3 and 4 June 1991, where the current Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp)&mdash;</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was half a decade ago, but Dr Kemp was commissioned to do the work then and he is now the minister. What was he asked to do then? He was asked to be bound by the current imperatives. He noted that the coalition sought to encourage students to move from government to non-government schools. For five or six years, the objective of the coalition and this minister has been to encourage students to move from government to non-government schools. They have given no real consideration to the impact of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> It was also agreed at that meeting that Dr Kemp would report back to the committee on non-government schools and whether additional expenditure could be offset by reductions in grants to government schools and reductions in untied grants. That is exactly what you have done now. A long held ideological fixation of this minister and this government has been to reduce funding to government schools and give the extra funding to non-government ones. We had this debate over state aid years ago. We argue in opposition that you can pick up the McKinnon recommendations, change the formula and accommodate some of those problems <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that Senator Vanstone talked about earlier, but you should not throw away the baby with the bathwater, which is exactly what you are doing here. That is the real problem we have here. For those reasons, I move these amendments together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If senators such as Senator Harradine are really concerned about targeting people with disabilities and specific needs, this legislation does not provide that for them. This funding proposal is about a reduction in aid to government schools. This is legislation that lumps together former equities aimed at specific groups of educationally disadvantaged young people. You are now lumping them all together and blurring the focus of those programs. In respect of that, Keith Staples, the president of the Australian Council of State School Organisations, made it very clear to all of us in the Senate by letter this week, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A further concern with this bill is that the broadbanding of programs diminishes the capacity to target disadvantage. ACSSO particularly regrets the loss of the disadvantaged schools program and the students at risk program.</PARA>
<PARA>There are concerns. If you want to pick up some of the problems of the past regarding non-government school funding, there are mechanisms available to do that. That would essentially require a minor amendment after picking up the recommendations of McKinnon. I would rather pick up the recommendations of McKinnon than the ideological fixation of your former shadow ministry and now ministry, which is driven to push money from one sector to another and, as in so many other circumstances, divide the community.</PARA></SPEECH>

<STATE> (Victoria)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(5.34 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats support this amendment. We have been very clear in our approach to the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 1996, which is that we do not endorse the funding mechanism behind the legislation. I take this opportunity to put on the record my response to Senator Abetz this morning and to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone), the minister representing the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp), a little earlier. I did not say that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6167"> Jewish schools were fundamentalist. I merely quoted from their submission. I was very careful to say yesterday in my speech on the second reading debate that the Democrats could have lived with the abolition of the new schools policy provided that it did not proceed at the expense of the public schools sector. We do not have a problem with new non-government schools starting up. We have a problem with, firstly, allowing those schools to start up in a completely unplanned, ad hoc and unrestricted manner and, secondly, funding those schools by taking money off state schools.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very clear that, without any restrictions, the number of new schools that seek to start operation will be small. They will be much smaller in number than those state schools in Victoria, for example, which are currently being forced to close down. It is quite clear that a number of them will come from fundamentalist religious backgrounds. That is the reason I made that comment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I simply asked the Senate to consider whether it was good policy to fund those sorts of schools and that size of school&mdash;remembering that one of these schools might be set up with just one student&mdash;at the expense of mainstream public education. I believe that the answer to that question should be no. If Senator Abetz supports that proposition, he is seriously out of touch with the vast majority of Australians and he is certainly seriously out of touch with Australian parents with children in both government and non-government schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will turn to the amendments. The Democrats would have preferred to see the minister withdraw the abolition of the new schools policy and the enrolment benchmark adjustment for one year. That was the basis of our second reading amendment. There would be 12 months for a proper inquiry and 12 months for a public debate. I remind the Senate that there were just two days for a hearing of the committee on this matter. Even the peak bodies complained that they had had very little time to prepare submissions. They also complained that the data available to them was incomplete.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The peak bodies complained that there was inadequate information. They complained about having no time to get back to their own groups, whether it was other bodies or school councils. It was very clear that the level of public debate on this issue was low and that people were not fully aware of the implications. I do not think the government was either.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In our view, it would have been a much more appropriate and responsible approach to have delayed those elements of the bill until this could have taken place. It is hard to imagine how much wider those concerns could be when you have teachers and parents from state schools, teachers and parents from private schools, state governments, education academics and Catholic and independent schools all saying that when they finally came to grips with the information it was found to be incorrect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suggest that surely any reasonable minister who was genuinely concerned about this portfolio would sit down and have a rethink. Unfortunately, the minister has not had that rethink. He has not agreed to further consultation and has not agreed to defer these changes for that 12-month period. The Democrats believe that we do not have any alternative but to support the opposition's amendments, which would at least seek to restrict the operation of the proposed enrolment benchmark adjustment and to ensure that clearly defined planning processes are in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very obvious from listening to the speakers in the second reading debate that they still do not understand how the EBA works. I want to take some time yet again today to go through that mechanism. I want to refer to a table which was included in the report of the committee. It is on page 67, for those who have a copy of it here. This table is based on the department's own figures. It is based on the figures of projected enrolments over the next four years. It is based on the government's own figures in relation to funding mechanisms and it also calculates how that enrolment benchmark adjustment works.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to draw the Senate's attention to the fact that the government projects that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6168"> 23,524 students will not be in state government schools at the end of that four-year period. It is very important to note that. This is a change from the previous estimate that the government gave during the budget period, which was, as Senator Bolkus mentioned, a small increase of 4,000 students. These are the figures we are all working from and these are the figures from which I draw my suggestion that $305 million will come out of the state system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A total of 23,524 students will exit the state system. If you look at that table you will also see a figure of 94,551, which is the total number of students over and above the current numerical level in the private sector. So we have the state sector losing 23,524 students and the non-government schools increasing their numbers by 94,551.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You will clearly see from the enrolment benchmark adjustment calculations that $1,712 does not simply follow those 23,000 students who exit the state system. That $1,712 is applied to the figure which is over and above the current benchmark. That figure becomes $73,669 by the year 2000. The EBA does not simply allow the $1,712.50 to follow the students out of the state sector and into the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a different mechanism which draws $1,712 for every new student in the private sector. That is not the same thing because, overall, the total enrolments will increase by something like 61,000. That increase, which is mostly going into the private sector, will be paid for by deductions to the state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason why I did not concentrate on questions such as broadbanding and disability services is that this is such a fundamental question. It seems to me that very few people have followed this debate and have followed that mechanism. It is absolutely crucial because if this enrolment benchmark adjustment is continued over time as we go beyond the year 2000, the cumulative effect of this would be that eventually the government would be taking so much away from the state sector as a result of the EBA that it would have no money left going back into the state system. By my calculations, we reached that point by something less than 50 per cent in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> state schools and 50 per cent in the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, we are not looking at those figures but I think we need to recognise that a mechanism such as this is going in that kind of direction. I am not suggesting that we are going to get to that point. I am simply saying that the higher the proportion of private school students to government school students, the higher this penalty is applied to the states. It is very important that everybody recognises this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is interesting that in her speech at the end of the second reading stage, the minister pointed to my choice of the quote from the Jewish day schools and one or two other fairly minor points, but did not address this key question. She has not at any stage challenged my assertion that, based on the government's own projections, $305 million will be withdrawn from the state system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I go back to the figures that Senator Bolkus was talking about&mdash;the figures that came out at the time of the budget, which showed that the government increased its enrolments by some $4,000. I think the figure was $3,900&hyphen;odd. Under those circumstances, because the private sector would have increased its proportion and it would have increased its numbers numerically, by my calculations there would have been a cut of $270 million. That is with the state sector maintaining its current level&mdash;its current actual numbers. It is losing its proportion, yes, but it is maintaining its numbers and the cut would still have been $270 million from the state sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope I have explained that. I am happy to go through that again. As I said, I think it is absolutely fundamental. I also think it is unfair, and this is the reason why the Democrats do not support it.</PARA></SPEECH>

It is designed to ensure that money in a sense follows the students so that, where there is a shift of students, there would be a shift of money. It is an adjustment to the grants to the states and territories as a consequence of the movement in the ratio of non-government students to government students from the 1996 benchmark.

If you want to avoid that, that is fair enough.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not believe you have. Nonetheless, I have the floor now&mdash;I am happy to sit down and let you have another go. I will move on in any event. The proportion of enrolments in non-govern <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> ment schools has moved from about 24.4 in 1983 to 29 in 1995. The aggregate of the annual savings to the states since 1983 because of that shift is estimated to be about $3 billion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The enrolment benchmark adjustment seeks to split those savings fifty&hyphen;fifty with the states. It reduces the potential for cost shifting between levels of government. It adjusts the share of government school general recurrent grants to states by approximately 50 per cent of the gain that would accrue to state governments as a result of the enrolment drift from the government sector to the non-government sector. The states still retain the remaining 50 per cent gain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will give you an example of the operation of the EBA. If the census showed an increase in the non-government enrolment share at the end of 1997, the states would gain on average $3,400 per student. That is their saving. The effect of the EBA is that the states would retain $1,700 and $1,700 would be deducted from the Commonwealth's grants to the states. If the census showed no change in relative enrolment shares or an increase in the government share, the EBA would not be triggered. For example, if a state experienced a 0.4 per cent increase in the share of non-government enrolments&mdash;up from 29 per cent in 1996 to 29.4 per cent in 1997&mdash;and that equated to a drift of 5,000 students, the EBA would be triggered. If the average net saving in the state was $3,400 per student, the total saving would be $17 million. Under such a scenario, the Commonwealth would retain $8.5 million and the state would retain $8.5 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The total projected Commonwealth funding for all schools is an increase of $3.7 billion over the next four years. That comes through SPPs, EBAs and FAGs. You asked what would happen if the numbers stayed the same&mdash;I think that is what your point is&mdash;in government schools and the proportion changed because there was an increase in non-government sector enrolments. I just point out that your whole question is prefaced on an assumption on your part that, where there is an increase in enrolments, government schools will not be able to have a share of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6170"> them because they are not performing well enough to attract the parents' choices. That is your assessment. That is the scenario you are working on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You ask then would the funding decrease. Let me make it plain to you: total funding to schools, government and non-government, will increase. But if the enrolment benchmark is triggered, that necessarily means that some of the money that would otherwise have been kept by the states for their government schools would go the other way. I think that is the whole purpose of it. It amazes me that you have not yet come to grips with that.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think Senator Allison is basically asking me the same thing that Senator Carr has just asked me. I believe I made it clear from my answer to him that the numbers stay the same but the proportion changes. You have picked up on the remarks that I made to him, but I think it is a pretty non-supportive proposition to put for government schools. You have suggested that, where there are increases in enrolments because of population change, the government sector will get none of them. That is the assumption that your question is based on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite right that, if those new students all shift to non-government schools, certainly there should be an adjustment towards the non-government schools because they are taking all the extra students. Of course there should be, and there would be, but only as it relates to the EBA. Senator, I should counsel you against getting this out of perspective. The EBA is a small part of the total funding. If you do not accept the EBA, you are saying that, irrespective of parents making the choice that they want their children to have a different education, irrespective of the fact that parents might choose to send their kids to the local Christian school, total funding as it exists today should stay the same for ever and a day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You are suggesting that we should keep funding government schools, despite what may be continuing declining enrolments, and fund them at the same level. You are saying that we should provide no incentive whatsoever for government schools to appreciate the consequences of losing students&mdash;no incentive at all: just keep performing as they are. You <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6172"> know full well that there are plenty of government schools that are doing really well. They are schools that people want to get their kids into. That is the choice they want to make.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to reflect that choice in funding. If all the new students go to other schools, there should be some adjustment to reflect that. Of course there should be. I am at a loss to understand why you do not think that should be the case. I am equally at a loss to understand why it is that this relatively speaking minor adjustment&mdash;because it is a fifty&hyphen;fifty sharing of the windfall gain to the states&mdash;is something that you treat as the whole funding package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You comment as if funding to government schools is going to fall. If you set up an enrolment benchmark adjustment which is designed to reflect changes in student loads, and someone has a reduction in the proportion of their load, obviously vis-a-vis that benchmark adjustment it will be a negative if they get a lesser proportion. But to pretend that that somehow is a large part of the funding and to ignore the fact that in any event, on the calculations that we have done&mdash;which show an increase to non-government schools&mdash;government schools get more perplexes me.</PARA></SPEECH>

I think it is important to get on the record that the government accepts that that is the case. I would also like to ask a more fundamental question. Why does the government not simply fund new enrolment places in the private sector? Why does it feel the need to make this shift on the basis of a proportion? Why not simply say, if 23,000 students come out of the state sector, let us remove the per capita grant that those students attract, which is around $406 on average per student.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will pick up on a comment that you made. Funding, in my view, does already reflect the choice made by parents. I am simply asking you why it is that we need this complex enrolment benchmark adjustment when another mechanism which funded that choice in private schools could do just as well. I think what you are telling me is that, at the end of the day, the government does not want to change its bottom line.

We think it is fair enough. We are prepared to split it fifty-fifty. You just keep ignoring the choices made by parents as if, for some reason, this shift that has been happening is not something the government need reflect in any way and can just go on ignoring.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We must presume that the answers provided to the Senate by your own department are accurate. We must presume that. We cannot presume that your answers are accurate, but I think it would be a reasonable conclusion to draw that the department would seek to get it right. It says that the net effect of the 1996&hyphen;97 budget measures, the basis for this bill, is the $128 million extra all up, and that is expenditure for schools in all sectors&mdash;private and public. However, the answer on question No. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6176"> 52 reflects a decline, particularly between 1996-97 and 1999&hyphen;2000, of some $87 million for the public sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, while we have an increase in total of $128 million, and we have a decline for the public sector of $87 million, is it not therefore logical to conclude that the proportion of money going to the private sector is dramatically increased, to the tune, in fact, of nearly $200 million?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Minister, the point is you were asked a direct question about the net effect of the budget measures. Your department indicates that the net effect of the budget measures is $128 million all up. You can try to confuse it by talking about whether or not these statements are in out&hyphen;year prices or constant prices, but I understand that both figures are in constant prices. This figure relates to the total budget cuts for your department of $4.3 billion over the four years.

We just have different in-principle views.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, you want to go to your constituency, which you see at the moment as being government schools, and say, `This is unfair. You should be able to retain whatever moneys you were otherwise thinking you were going to get, irrespective of falling enrolments. We tried in the Senate a falling proportion of enrolments. If you keep the same numbers you have got today, and in the year 2010 you still have the same numbers and all the other kids have gone somewhere else, you come to us, because we will ensure that you keep the same money.' We think that is ridiculous. We want to have a mechanism that recognises that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is at the edge of funding. To you and I, this is a lot of money. Of course it is. But across funding for schools, it is a small adjustment to make. You do not think that that adjustment should be made. You think that in the year 2010, if they have the same number of students as today, things should be left as they are. I presume that is the argument you are raising. You are saying `if they have the same number of students', despite the fact that in the year 2010 we might have a lot more students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am working on your assumption&mdash;not mine&mdash;that all of it goes to non-government schools. That is a harsh assumption on your part, but it is probably made simply for the purposes of debate to keep the argument simple. Perhaps you do assume that they would go to non-government schools. If you do assume that all the growth goes to non-government schools, your argument is that there should be no adjustment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In principle, we have a disagreement. We think parents want greater choice. They have demonstrated that. Despite the restrictive new schools policy of the previous government, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> parents were still determined to make alternative choices for their children. They did so sometimes without Commonwealth funding. We think that is wrong. We think the funding has to reflect the choices the parents want to make.

I note, Minister, that you are saying that it is a small matter, that this calculation is nothing in relation to the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> overall funding picture. But I come back to what Senator Harradine said in the second reading debate. He said that where a student moves from one system to another, the savings go with them and that the principle of money following the students was a reasonable one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think I agree with that. That is why I suggested earlier that if there are new students going into the private sector, why not fund them on a per capita basis, just as we do now? And why not fund the government school students on their per capita basis, just as we do now? What you are really saying, I think, is that there are going to be 61,000 new enrolments but that the government is not prepared to fund them, that it is going to have to find the money elsewhere and that the enrolment benchmark adjustment is finding that money through the state system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come back to this because it is fundamentally important. Senator Harradine says that it is the reason why he voted against my amendment which would have allowed us at least 12 months to get this matter of the dollars, the mechanism and whether or not it was reasonable sorted out. Senator Harradine was of the view that the principle of money following the student is reasonable, and I totally agree with that. But I hope that today's debate has shown that it is not about the principle of the money following the student; it is the principle of the money following the proportion of students. The two are very, very different.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have already demonstrated that if the government schools&mdash;and you may or may not think this is reasonable&mdash;maintain their numbers, that is, that no students went across to the private sector, there was no matter of money following students who pack their bags and went into the private sector, the state systems would still lose money. That is the point of this whole debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6179"> I come back to that calculation&mdash;$305 million, which is the result to the state system of the figures that have been prepared by the government. As I say once again, I did not make them up. They are the government's own figures. It is not reasonable, Minister, for you to say that we are scaremongering or that we are making up figures at will. The govern ment expects that 23,000 fewer students will be in the state system. It expects that 94,000 more students will be in the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might disagree with those figures, and I probably would, and they are, at best, guesses, I imagine. Nevertheless, they are what we have to go on. They are official figures. They are what the government has produced and, at the end of the day, what they mean is that, for that loss of 23,000 students in the state sector, there will be a penalty of $305 million. If you divide the $305 million by that figure of 23,000, even if you spread it over the four&hyphen; year period, we do not get $1,712.50. We get something like three times that amount.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think you have got to be honest, Minister, and explain, particularly to Senator Harradine, who expects that this is a reasonable proposition. He expects that the principle of money following the student is reasonable, and I think so, too. What we have here is something quite different. The enrolment benchmark adjustment is not reasonable. It is not fair and it is skewed to take money, because the federal government would need to fund the private sector at a higher rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know that the average contribution, by per capita recurrent grants, is more than $2,000 for the private sector and, on average, around $400 to the government sector. That is per capita. I realise that FAG grants make up the difference to the states&mdash;we all understand that&mdash;but the point is that the government is going to have to wear a much higher cost. I think it is about $180 million more by the time we get to the year 2000, on the basis of these figures, because of that higher per capita grant that it makes to the private sector. The government is funding the expansion of the private sector and it has to take those dollars away from the state system in order to protect its bottom line. That is the crunch of this whole debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is quite irrelevant to be talking about the FAGs and about how much the states are going to contribute to add to that spending on education because, Minister, you do not know that any more than I do. We do not know what the state governments are going to spend on education between now and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the year 2000. We have already heard that there is no evidence that there will be an increase. And anyway, it is irrelevant. It is irrelevant to this debate, which is primarily about the enrolment benchmark adjustment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think what we have heard from you today is an admission&mdash;you do not actually come out and say it&mdash;that the money does not follow the student, that it is the money following the proportion. That, I suggest to you, is unfair and unreasonable. It is a penalty being applied to the state sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I really think it is time the government re-examined this whole question and found a more equitable solution to its bottom line. If it is going to have to fund this expansion in the private sector, it ought to look at how it is going to do that. I suggest that to take that money out of the state sector and, I suppose, develop a funding mechanism which does that in this very devious way and for you to suggest that somehow it is the fault of the states that this is all happening is quite unreasonable. I really do not know how much more I can say on this issue to make it clear to senators. What is absolutely clear is that the money does not follow the student and that is a most unreasonable position.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not say that this is the fault of the states. I do not say that at all. The reason parents make the choices they make is a matter for them. There may be reasons quite unrelated to state government decisions that encourage or motivate parents to make a different choice. So I do not say that this is the fault of the state governments at all. If you have got that impression, you have got the wrong impression. If I have given you the wrong impression, I hope that I have now made it clear.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point was made, as I have indicated to you, that this focus on the EBA is, I think, out of perspective. I have indicated that to you. I say that it is a relatively small adjustment being made. You paraphrase that and say that I say it is nothing. I do not say that it is nothing, but I do say that it is small. On our rough calculations&mdash;that is not to the last decimal point&mdash;it would be about three per <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6180"> cent if you looked at it as a proportion of SPPs. If you did as Senator Carr did in 1995 when he wanted to sing the praises of the then government and you put SPPs and FAGs together, you would see that it is less than one per cent. That is what we are focusing on here: of the total&mdash;that is, SPPs and FAGs&mdash;it is an adjustment that on our calculations is less than one per cent. That is what I was seeking to highlight by saying, `Do not get this EBA out of perspective at all.' I think I indicated and said that, relative to the total funding, it is a small thing. Relative to the total funding, it is a very small thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just come back to the point, Senator Allison: you and I have a different policy view here. We believe that if parents are going to choose for their children to be students in non-government schools and if that shift keeps happening, we should not allow the states to engage in that cost shifting and just expect to keep the same amount of money. So a relatively small adjustment mechanism has been set up&mdash;the EBA. As a proportion of SPPs and FAGs, we calculate that that will be just under one per cent. You think that is inappropriate. I do not, and the government does not think it is inappropriate. I just wanted to highlight for you exactly what the proportions are as we calculate them. According to our calculations, they are about three per cent of SPPs. But when you look at the total funding picture, it is less than one per cent. That is what we are talking about now.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have in front of me the DEETYA submission to the committee. At page 16, paragraph 3.1.3, dealing with the effects of the enrolment benchmark adjustment on New South Wales, states:  </PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New South Wales data, quoted in the second reading speech debate and in the New South Wales Department of Training and Education submission No. 13 to the committee&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which you were on&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">indicated that the impact of the enrolment benchmark adjustment would be a net cost to the government rather than a reduced level of savings.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what you are asking me about. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The New South Wales government's advice to DEETYA shows that with 21,000 fewer students in the government sector or a shift of two per cent enrolments; firstly, the state has a reduced funding requirement of some $37.2 million; and, secondly, the state incurs additional non&hyphen;government per capita grant costs of $3.7 million; and, thirdly, that the state loses $9 million Commonwealth per capita grants funding; and, fourthly, the state loses $35.8 in funds as a result of the benchmark adjustment.</PARA>
<PARA>In summary, you probably have the table in front of you so it might be easier to move on. The DEETYA submission goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The analysis, however, is flawed and incorrect. The savings figure of $37.2 million simply reflects the reduced direct costs of teacher salaries. The analysis is inadequate in not recognising the saving to the state in reduced requirement for school executive staffing, school and non-school administrative staffing, as well as general school running costs and utility costs. For this reason, the saving is significantly understated.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The analysis also included a notional reduction in Commonwealth funding of $9 million. This amount represents general recurrent funds which would have been provided by the Commonwealth for the 21,000 students who had left the  government sector. As general recurrent funding is provided on a per capita basis, the New South Wales government could only expect to be paid in respect of the actual numbers of students in government schools in the state and would never have been entitled to the $9 million shown or referred to above. Accordingly, that amount should be disregarded.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>This report is about the compliance activity in the Department of Social Security. It is the first quarterly report for 1996&hyphen;97 to parliament. I rise to speak on this compliance report because it indicates good news in that the department has been able to achieve savings as a result of higher compliance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prior to the last election, the government made it very clear that one of its priorities in social security was to ensure that only those <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> entitled to benefits should receive them. The vast majority of social security recipients are in need of assistance. However, a small minority have been rorting the system, ripping off taxpayers and bringing all social security recipients into disrepute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There had developed a genuine antagonism on the part of members of the community who felt social security recipients were receiving special treatment at their expense. As a consequence, there was beginning to be an erosion of community support for genuine social security recipients. Many of those recipients were being tarred with the same brush as those who were rorting the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These compliance measures, which have been introduced, will help to restore faith in the system and to ensure that the unemployed and other social security recipients are not demonised. According to the report that Senator Newman tabled today, recovery of debts by the Department of Social Security in the first quarter of 1996&hyphen;97 amounted to $84.4 million&mdash;an increase of 44.2 per cent from the same period of 1995-96. Total estimated savings from data&hyphen;matching of $75.5 million in the first quarter of 1996&hyphen;97 represents a 19.9 per cent increase in savings in the first quarter of 1995-96.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although former Senator Richardson, when he was Minister for Social Security in the former government, said it was a tight ship and nothing could be done to make savings, and Mr Baldwin said over and over again that there were no savings to be made in social security, in the first nine months here we have seen a government that means business and means to ensure that those who really need assistance get it and those not using the system in the appropriate way are discovered and prevented from rorting or receiving a benefit they are not entitled to. Despite opposition and welfare sector claims that the system was already watertight and that savings could not be made, the government has prevented overpayment and fraud and recovered debts to the tune of $384 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6182"> Despite the terrific savings and the fact that the officers of the Department of Social Security have worked to achieve these results in conjunction with the government&mdash;I com mend the work done by the officers&mdash;yesterday all those benefits and more were wiped away in one fell swoop. Those Social Security officers worked their insides out to achieve that gain. We had it wiped off yesterday in one fell swoop.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition refused to accept the voters' verdict on 2 March. They are pretending to be a government in exile and have added $400 million to the deficit and the public debt. That is what they did yesterday&mdash;the Democrats, Greens and the opposition combined added $400 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They might have another chance when the legislation comes back from the House of Representatives. I ask them to reconsider because we went to the election indicating what we would be doing about benefits and newly arrived migrants, not about refugees&mdash;they were quarantined. The public knew what we were going to do and the people on the other side have added to the debt and have not enabled us to carry out what we said we would do during the election. Those gains that were recorded have now been lost. I would ask those on the other side to reconsider, when they have the opportunity, because the benefits gained were lost yesterday.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy President. I was making the point that Senator Hill has come into this chamber and asked, `Where is the Labor Party policy?' He has put the challenge down. These coalition parties only put their policy down in the election period, knowing that it could not be scrutinised in detail over a number of months and, therefore, did not detail the changes that they proposed in the legislation that we dealt with yesterday. Having done that, John Howard in May clarified the position and said he had merely intended to extend the Labor Party's proposition and add 18 months to it, but by the time the ledger budget was done and the legislation came into this chamber, another 14 categories had been added to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you want to improve this situation, it is not by restricting people's rights when they <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6183"> get here, but by having the right people targeted to come here. That is the whole point of a good immigration program. It is no use bringing people to this country to be unemployed or dependent on welfare. The whole idea of immigration is to bring people to this country so they can play a productive role and justify our immigration program. Australia's immigration program is not altruistic. It is there for the benefit and self&hyphen;interest of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Senator Patterson mentioned, in terms of this compliance report, the great things data matching had done. I can remember her hypocritical speeches opposing data matching. I can remember all the speeches from this side of the chamber about how we were evil for bringing in data matching. The only difference is that you walked 10 yards, sat on the other side and now it is the best thing since sliced bread. No-one opposes a crackdown on obvious welfare fraud, least of all anyone on this side. What we do oppose is the constantly exhibited double standards arising from the contrast between when the coalition was in opposition and its converted position now that it is in government. To basically use this report as an excuse to re&hyphen;debate the issues of yesterday, having tried to get more time for the current matter before the chair, shows an absolute lack of discipline on the coalition side and among its management. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have had a number of changes announced in relation to social security. Many make it more difficult for people to exist, considering how this government is prepared to assist with their basic survival, yet we know that there is a high level of unemployment. We also know that there is a high and growing number of working poor. These are people who cannot survive on the money they get from working sometimes long hours and sometimes in jobs with very little security.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> There is a corporate sector in the government, and it has a total budget of $187 million. This sector includes the compliance and recovery unit. In the budget, this was mentioned as having less than $10 million for <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a staff of around 150 people. At the end of this year, we may find that the budget will be greater than that. We are yet to find out at the end of the year whether more people have been put on to investigate whether people are cheating the welfare system in huge measure. In the context of a budget of something like $40 billion, none of the figures presented today indicate anything like a large, or even moderate, level of cheating on the welfare system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> We do not know how many people, as a result of this purge, have been kicked off their basic form of survival for breaking a technical rule. However, we do know that it is always easy to find people who have broken technical rules without any real regard being shown for how those people are going to survive. What we do know in our society is that groups such as Anglicare have run out of emergency food. Maybe the community is picking up the tab for technicalities that people have been finding in order to get good figures that enable them to come back to the Senate and look as though they are doing something.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to know&mdash;it is just a question; I might have missed something&mdash;whether the $384 million that Senator Patterson mentioned was for the total compliance or for new compliance for the crackdown. That is important, because this compliance unit has been added to with the extra purge. Perhaps $384 million is the total. There is that general ongoing activity. If you had this level of compliance in any scheme for business assistance, you would be jumping for joy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We give billions of dollars annually for business assistance and corporate welfare. We think something like 10 per cent non-compliance for the business sector sounds alright generally, but that represents hundreds of millions of dollars annually. We encourage tax avoiders in our system, because we find that they are in the new wave to international free trade. We see people involved with vertical integration. People in whole industries who are involved with transfer pricing can organise where and how they pay tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Billions of dollars are going out of the country on an annual basis, but we are not <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6184"> going to concentrate on that. We are concentrating on the $4 million raised from a total of 13,710 reviews as a result of the information received from the public. That is $4 million in total from 13,710 reviews. It is a fact that 1,715 customers had their payments cancelled and a further 1,295 had their payments reduced. We do not know the social circumstances of those people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Interestingly enough, we just went through an industrial relations bill&mdash;I do not call it a workplace reform bill&mdash;where we said that small business's compliance with the law should be based on its ability to pay. We do not care what we do with people who have no ability to survive in our community. We take them off and perhaps put them in prison. Does this give figures of people who might end up being prosecuted and having to go to prison as a result of rules they may or may not have broken wilfully or non-wilfully in an attempt to survive? It is an appalling indictment that this is what this government thinks is the means of concentration in our society. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must rise in this debate and express my concern at a number of features regarding the way this document has been presented and how this government has debated it. Its features are highlighted when one looks at what the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) said today in question time and how she tried to disparage the former minister for social security, the honourable member for Sydney (Mr Baldwin), and his view of how the government was proceeding with compliance in the social security area. She disparaged him at question time. She tried to portray him as someone who essentially did not know what was going on and was not in control.</PARA></TALK.START>

But a lot happened during last year. One thing that was enhanced last year was data matching. At that stage, the opposition opposed government initiatives in data matching. They have had a long opposition in this area. They are now claiming credit for something that the previous government and minister were involved in enhancing and made sure was working in a comprehensive way. They have done it not only with this issue but also with migrants.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no recognition by this minister. She was bludging on the back bench yesterday while her parliamentary secretary was doing the work, putting through legislation which the government saw as being critical. She was sitting on the back bench, hovering around, getting advice from her advisers, but she would not get into the debate. Why would she not get into the debate? Because she could not cop the heat. She is not up to it. She is not up to the standards of this place. She could not submit herself to questioning. We have seen that day after day. This minister is not up to the job. She was bludging off Senator Tambling in terms of yesterday's debate on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does the minister forget to mention when she goes out on the airwaves and does her soft interviews? She forgets to mention <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6185"> that some two-thirds of migrants coming into Australia get jobs within the first 12 months of their being here and pay tax on their wages. She forgets to mention that three-quarters of the migrants coming into Australia get jobs within 18 months and pay tax. A lot of these people hit the  ground running in terms of payments of taxes, but this minister, in an attempt to malign migration and to use migration as a political football, following her leader, following the dishonesty shown by this government in terms of trying to discredit the importance of migration&mdash;migration which has been quite critical to this country&mdash;selectively goes out and does not even pay any due respect to the contribution that migrants make here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to make one other point, to pick up on the point made by Senator Margetts. There is concern when there is such a rapid increase in payment cancellation or rate reduction because some people may be unfairly treated. My concern emanates from the fact that this is the government that is cutting apart the infrastructure for legal assistance in this country. We are talking here of people who are the weakest in our community. They may be doubly hit by this government's activities. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

The reason why I single out those two players is not just because I was also at State High but because Ian Healy was the year ahead of me and Michael Kasprowicz was in my sister's year at Brisbane State High School. I felt immensely proud to have the opportunity to go to the Gabba on Sunday and see both of them playing for Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It really is a tribute to the sporting excellence that Brisbane State High School has been renowned for over many years that at one time we could produce two players in the Australian test cricket 11. I must admit that there were a number of other people from State High who also attended the match over the weekend. There was a young chap in grade nine who was sitting two rows behind me. I found out from my best mate, who was at State High with me, that his father, who was school vice-captain in 1956 or 1957, was also in my section of the ground.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Everybody was cheering for Michael Kasprowicz when he bowled. There is enormous support for him. He has been a very honest, hard&hyphen;working player. He spent six years in the Queensland side. He first played for Queensland when he was in year 12 at school. He served his apprenticeship in the Queensland Sheffield Shield side. He played in the side that won the Shield the other season and now he has made the Australian side.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was disappointed, however, to hear the Channel Nine commentators saying that they did not believe that Michael Kasprowicz was deserving of a spot on the side. Senator Ray shakes his head. I shook my head. Both Ian <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6186"> Chappell and, I think, Richie Benaud were saying that they would not have picked Michael Kasprowicz. They did not think he was deserving of a spot.</PARA>

He will in time mature into a very fine test bowler for Australia, somebody of whom we can all be very proud.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one thing I want to remark about Michael Kasprowicz. At a time when many cricket players tend to forget about the kids who stand out on the boundary waiting for autographs, Michael Kasprowicz was conspicuous in making an effort to sign the bats, the caps, the brochures and the magazines that young boys came up to the boundary with and asked him to sign. I think that is very important. It is easy if you are a famous sportsman to sometimes neglect the young children who want your autograph. Let us remember that not so long ago Michael <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Kasprowicz was one of those schoolchildren, standing on a boundary I am sure. He has realised his dream and the dream of many of us of playing in the Australian side.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I hope that both Healy and Kasprowicz have long runs in the Australian side and that they realise the full potential that we in Queensland know that they have. Ian Healy's knock of 161 not out was absolutely magnificent, another unbeaten innings in the second innings. He was also named Man of the Match. Hopefully, Brisbane State High School will not only have the Australian vice&hyphen;captain but also one of our leading fast bowlers in the Australian test side for many years to come.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is obvious that Matthew Hayden went to the wrong school. I have spoken twice before in the Senate&mdash;it will be a matter of interest to Senator O'Chee&mdash;about allegations made in this chamber about an officer from the Department of Administrative Services; namely, someone who works for OGIA. It was alleged in this chamber that this particular officer had been offered a lucrative job and had also distorted evaluations in the gun buy-back campaign. I am not here to go over all that material again. That has been done in the past.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the features of this particular case was that Mr John Mellors, the Secretary to the Department of Administrative Services, indicated to us at the second estimates committee hearing on these matters that he was doing a report for the minister. When we had the third hearing, he indicated that he had sent that report to the minister. It is interesting to note that the officer that these allegations had been made against has had no real right of response in any way other than by my raising it in the chamber. I would like to make it <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6187"> quite clear that I have never spoken to this officer up until today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Mellors, having given his report to the minister, then refused&mdash;I think quite properly&mdash;to answer any questions at the estimates committee on the basis that his report was advice to the minister. I want to make it quite clear that it is not only the officer concerned but also another advertising agency whose reputations are being questioned here. They made a very vigorous response. They even went to the St James Ethics Centre and swore a statutory declaration on these matters denying the allegations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had allegations being made, but no knowledge about how the allegations had arrived here in this chamber. Under cross-examination at the estimates committee, we found that the minister's office had rung a senior officer in OGIA and asked for information relating to the alleged job offer and to distorted evaluations. Lo and behold, one day after these inquiries had been made, this information surfaces in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have asked on notice, I have asked consistently and I have had no response: did the minister's office pass on these allegations to be raised deliberately here in the Senate or not? It would be a very serious matter if a minister were willing to hang one of his own employees out to dry merely to cover up another fix, scandal and rort that this whole gun buy-back contract has been about. I regard it as the duty of any minister to defend the employees of the department up to the point at which it is defensible. I think that is a sacred duty. I have an enormous suspicion in this case that the exact reverse has in fact occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I did ask at the estimates committee and the minister took it on board that at least could the committee be informed when this case has been finalised&mdash;and we have been. But in what an insulting way have we been informed. The Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Jull) writes to the chairman of the committee, Senator Ian Macdonald. He includes in his letter to Senator Ian Macdonald a couple of personal references which no doubt, I assume pretty sincerely, were about his promotion to parliamentary secretary.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we as a committee do not even get the letter from Mr Jull. What we get is a letter from Senator Ian Macdonald to the committee relaying the sentiments of the letter that Mr Jull had sent him. What did that letter say in the key paragrah, the second paragraph? It said that it had been decided that no further action be taken against the officer and that the officer was going to be offered a voluntary redundancy. That is too cute by half.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why didn't Mr Jull write to the committee and say what happened; why didn't he say that there was no evidence found that there was a job offer made; why didn't he write to the committee and say that there was no distorted evaluation; and, even more particularly, why didn't Mr Jull write to the committee and say that the officer concerned had done the right thing, had notified her superior of a potential conflict of interest and had abided by the DAS and Public Service guidelines? Instead, we get this cute letter just saying that no further action was going to be taken and almost implying&mdash;not deliberately, certainly not by Senator Macdonald&mdash;that that officer had now been offered a voluntary redundancy after these events had occurred, when in fact she had applied for one much earlier of her own volition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a very sad case when a minister will not come clean on this issue and the related issues. I might add that this report which has gone to the minister was not an official public service report. This was not taken under the Public Service Act; this was an informal seeking of advice by the minister about allegations about an officer. So you do not even have the normal protections that would apply to an official inquiry under the Public Service Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In all this, I do not have any criticism of the staff of the Department of Administrative Services. The minister sought advice often. Mr Mellors heard statements from people and made a report to the minister; so he behaved with the sort of propriety we would expect of a public servant. The real fault here is not even with my colleague on the other side who made the allegations&mdash;I assume he made them thinking the information he had been given <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6188"> was correct; the fault lies at a ministerial level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will summarise the faults here: firstly, having a member of a minister's staff ring a department seeking dirt on another officer was wrong and, secondly, passing that information on was wrong. But the really criminal act was to pass that information on only in part&mdash;not notifying the recipients, whoever they were, that in fact the officer had done the absolutely correct thing under the Public Service and DAS ethics guidelines and notified a potential conflict of interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of all this, a question mark remains over the officer's behaviour by the way in which the Estimates committee has been notified of resolution of this matter. Question marks still hang over the reputation of a very ethical advertising agency. That fault does not lie with what was said in this chamber; it lies with the Minister for Administrative Services. He has to answer these questions: did he know that one of his staff members was making inquiries about an officer of OGIA and allegations? Does he know whether that information was passed on to backbench senators in this chamber? Will he at least now come clean and say that the Secretary to the Department of Administrative Services has now reported not so much that no further action can be taken, but in fact that there is no evidence whatsoever that a lucrative job offer was made, that there is outstanding evidence that the evaluations were done by a team, and that there were no distortions in the evaluation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think Mr Jull has a responsibility to respond to these matters. I say again: I think it is very bad if a minister does not stick by his own departmental staff. That does not mean through thick and thin. If a staff member has misbehaved, there comes a point when a minister must take action. But when they are cleared, when they have been found innocent, to send a letter to the chairman of the committee&mdash;not even directly to the committee&mdash;then have that letter vulgarised and have it all left in doubt by cute language, to me is a grave disservice. It does not reflect well on the minister. I call on him to write to the committee with a full response as to the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> facts of this particular matter to clear one of his own employee's names. If he does not do that, I think he stands condemned.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(7.25 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I will be turning the Senate's attention once again to failings on accountability in government. This morning in the Senate, the Howard government demonstrated the lengths this government will go to prevent debate about scrutiny of government. The government combined with Independent Senator Mal Colston to prevent debate of Mr Kennett's plans to weaken the Auditor&hyphen;General's role as an independent government agency after a Senate motion was initiated by the Australian Democrats.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Western Australia the situation is much the same. The Court government continues to try to escape the repeated recommendations of independent inquiries which have been demanding action by government to improve and strengthen accountability in a number of areas. In fact, between them the federal and Western Australian coalition governments are mounting an assault on accountability. Through the twin effects of budget cuts and decreasing vigilance, we are retreating in the fight against impropriety, corruption and white&hyphen;collar crime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The offices of auditors&hyphen;general and the ASC are a case in point. I will return to the auditors&hyphen;general in a moment. First, I want to make some comments about the effect of federal government cuts to the Australian Securities Commission. I cannot do better than to quote the words of the Western Australian Director of Public Prosecutions, John McKechnie QC. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recent worrying trends are that the ASC is being wound back and moved out of its sort of sharp&hyphen;end regulation. . . . The ASC started with a flourish about 6 years ago and I am worried that unless there is an appropriate will and direction and, more importantly, adequate resourcing, the same thing will happen again.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, he is referring to the unchecked financial frauds of the 1980s and WA Inc. He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You can't apply economic rationalism to a social service which is essentially economically irrational. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6189"> . . . We investigate crime, we prosecute crime for social reasons, but you can't measure those in strict money (terms).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the end then, the Feds are making it easier to get away with white collar crime&mdash;for individuals and companies to profit improperly without proper and aggressive policing.</PARA>
<PARA>To return to the auditor&hyphen;general's role, the auditor&hyphen;general's agency role as an independent government watchdog is one of the people's most important accountability mechanisms. It is the auditor&hyphen;general who prevents the heady  mix of money and power leading to corruption. The independence of the auditor&hyphen;general is a crucial component of the accountability structure in our system of government. The WA Inc royal commission said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">[the Office of the Auditor General] provides a critical link in the accountability chain between the public sector, and the Parliament and the community. It alone subjects the practical conduct and operations of the public sector as a whole to regular, independent investigation and review.</PARA>
<PARA>It went on to say that more needed to be done if the public was to obtain the benefit and protection that the auditor&hyphen;general was capable of providing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The royal commission made a number of recommendations to strengthen the Office of the Auditor&hyphen;General, including the separation of audit and financial administration legislation. The principles of independence and accountability which concerned the WA Inc royal commission were revisited in the inquiry by the Commission on Government into the legislation governing the functions of the Auditor&hyphen;General. In Western Australia, the Office of the Auditor&hyphen;General has stated its role as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">[to provide the Parliament with] timely relevant quality information necessary to enhance public sector accountability and performance.</PARA>
<PARA>For effective scrutiny of the public sector, parliament requires unimpeded access to information on public expenditure and the operation of government programs and services, including the role of public officials.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Western Australia, there are a number of agencies established by statute which act on behalf of the public under parliamentary authority. These offices include that of the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Auditor&hyphen;General. The legislation establishing the Office of the Auditor&hyphen;General forms part of the state's accountability system. It is intended that agencies such as the Auditor&hyphen;General act independently of the executive in the performance of their duties. As such, they are required to declare or affirm that they will perform their roles in an impartial manner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that the community is assured that accountability agencies such as the Auditor&hyphen;General operate effectively to provide an adequate and balanced system of public sector accountability. For the public to be so assured, it is necessary for these accountability agencies to have the broadest possible jurisdiction across the public sector; sufficient powers and resources to access information and to effectively perform their designated roles; and complementary roles which provide a comprehensive framework for accountability that is understood by both the public sector and the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commission on Government recommended that the independence of the Office of the Auditor-General be enhanced by making the Auditor&hyphen;General a statutory authority. This would remove the Auditor-General's dependence on the government of the day for adequate resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Government agencies are the source of the bulk of the information regarding the business of government which is provided to ministers and to parliament. The nature of the political process is such that the objectivity of information provided from within the system may be open to question. Through the reports of the Auditor-General, parliament receives assessment of the information generated from within government. The WA royal commission into WA Inc. said that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is essential that the Auditor-General, in performing his or her functions, has a right of access to all relevant information.</PARA>
<PARA>The power of the Office of the Auditor-General to access information and its independence are crucial elements in the accountability chain. As the Commission on Government stated in report No. 1, brought down 15 months ago and which has still not been implemented by the Court government:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6190">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Parliament can only justify itself that the Auditor-General's assessment of the Executive's performance is objective if the Auditor-General is independent.</PARA>
<PARA>The Commission on Government consequently recommended that the proposed Auditor-General's Act should provide that, notwithstanding any statutory secrecy provision, the Auditor-General has the power to call for information and documents necessary for discharging the functions of the Auditor-General. In addition, the Commission on Government recommended that the Auditor-General have the right of access to cabinet decisions and related submissions subject to public interest immunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The recommendations of both the WA Inc. royal commission and the Commission on Government, both of them independent objective bodies, show that the Auditor-General must not be responsible to the executive&mdash;that is, the cabinet&mdash;or to the Treasurer. Both of these inquiries made recommendations which instead make the Auditor-General responsible to the parliament in terms of appointment, budget and reporting, enhancing the Auditor-General's role as the people's agent. I commend that commission on government recommendations to every parliament in Australia, particularly to the Victorian and Western Australian governments.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AX5">Senator CHRIS EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator O'Chee, Senator Murray and the chamber generally. These statutory declarations contain claims of extreme cruelty towards animals, extremely unsafe working conditions and the processing of contaminated and unclean meat. All of this appears to be done under an A&hyphen;plus rating from Ausmeat in its accreditation. So I was most disturbed when I received these approaches from my constituents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6194">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The affidavits they have provided to me describe the slaughter of lambs born to ewes on the premises by having them smashed against a wall, faulty bolt guns that require the animal to be shot many times and sometimes finally finished off with a rifle shot; sheep that have fallen off the hook into the blood drain; sheep, instead of being condemned, being put back onto the rail and processed in the normal way; sheep with footrot which are flyblown with large numbers of maggots being been put through for processing. Those are just a sample of some of the claims made by these persons who have worked at this abattoir.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The claims are quite shocking, and I treat them very seriously, as did my colleague in the Western Australian parliament Kim Chance, who is shadow minister for primary industry. He has raised in general terms these concerns in the state parliament. What has convinced me to raise them today is that these claims have now been corroborated by a number of former employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, I have three statutory declarations and those go to corroborate the tenor of the evidence of the original constituent who approached Kim Chance. It is important that these claims are properly and fully investigated. Today they have been referred to state government authorities for investigation. I know that senators, Senator O'Chee in particular, have raised concerns about some of these issues in the past. I think it is an important public policy matter. I do not pretend to have any great expertise in the area, but I was extremely shocked by the allegations made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of very important public policy considerations. One is the general health of the community in terms of possible contaminated meat or unclean meat being processed. Secondly, there is the question of workers' safety, and there is a range of concerns raised in the statutory declarations that go to proper safety standards at the abattoir. Thirdly, there is the humane and proper treatment of animals in the process. These statutory declarations raise very serious concerns about all three issues. I find them quite shocking.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think there is a federal interest in this issue in that I have been informed and have checked to see that this particular abattoir has been given an A&hyphen;plus rating by Ausmeat. That obviously carries some sort of endorsement that is important to the public. So I think it is essential that the public is reassured that it is an appropriate rating and that they can have confidence about the rating given by Ausmeat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not sure what inspections occur to ensure that that rating is appropriately given. Given that most of the meat at this abattoir is slaughtered for domestic consumption, I am not sure what involvement federal authorities have had. But I want to bring this case to their attention and ask them to investigate to ensure that all proper procedures have been followed and that the Commonwealth is not endorsing or giving accreditation to abattoirs that are perhaps not meeting the very proper standards that must be set.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This obviously raises questions about state inspection standards and the ability of health inspectors at a state level to ensure that complaints raised are dealt with. I know that these complaints have been referred to the state authorities today and, hopefully, the matter will be fully investigated and brought to a proper conclusion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also wanted to raise the question of the industrial relations aspects of this issue. These particular workers were employed under contracts with the Hillside Abattoir, trading as Smoothjob Pty Ltd. They were employed under individual contracts. Those contracts provided for this work force&mdash;which, as I understand it, is non&hyphen;unionised&mdash;to be employed under contracts of service that provide for termination under one hour's notice. These were permanent, longstanding employees, but they were employed under these sorts of conditions under individual workplace contracts. What has occurred in this instance is that, when a number of these workers raised concerns about both the conditions of the abattoir and the non-payment of proper workers compensation arrangements, their service as casual employees was immediately terminated.  </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6195">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, from this parliament's point of view&mdash;even though we have completed the industrial relations legislation debate just recently&mdash;I think it is important that we understand the wider social implications of some of these working conditions. It not only impacts on workers who feel they have no power in their employment situation, because of the casualisation of their workplace and the individual contracts under which they are employed, but also it has a wider ramification for society in terms of our ability to influence work practices and things that will impact on the wider community or consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of the lack of power of these individuals to exercise control over their workplace, we may well be in a situation where unsafe meat is being put into homes around Western Australia. So there are flow-on effects from some of these industrial relations issues that go much beyond the industrial relations context and have implications for the whole of society&mdash;be it, in this case, as consumers and, in other cases, in other ways.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I do wish to put these concerns before the Senate today. I think most people will be as distressed and disgusted as I am by the claims. I have taken the precaution of ensuring that these claims have been put into the form of a statutory declaration and have been corroborated by at least three members of the work force. It is not a concern I raise lightly. I think it is important that these concerns are thoroughly investigated. We need to ensure that the quality of meat and the working conditions of workers in our abattoirs are of a proper standard and that proper inspection services are put in place to ensure those standards are maintained.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>
