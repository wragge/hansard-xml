<STATE> (Tasmania&mdash;</STATE>
<ROLE>Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate)</ROLE>
<TIME.STAMP>(12.34 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At this stage, I just indicate the approach of the opposition for the remainder of this bill. In order to facilitate the timetable, considering where we are in the debate in the committee stage on the industrial relations legislation, on behalf of the Labor opposition I will be reading for two or three minutes our position on the entire schedule and then tabling and incorporating our comments at the beginning of each schedule on all of the amendments that we are proposing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be some contributions from my Senate colleagues on a number of the amendments as we move through. We are conscious of the enormous program before the Senate and, in order to facilitate the conclusion of the debate, we do believe that this will be improved significantly by a responsible approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to the remainder of schedule 5 awards, the transitional provisions are the provisions which demonstrate the greatest breach of promise by Mr Howard. Mr Howard said that no worker would be worse off under this industrial relations policy. Even more explicitly, on 6 October, he told the Freight Congress:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . no worker in Australia under the Howard industrial relations policy can have his or her award conditions taken away. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5374"> </PARA>
<PARA>This is precisely what these transitional provisions do. In 18 months time, all award conditions outside the 20 allowable matters or any exceptional matters will be abolished by these provisions. Employees will have to bargain during that period just to preserve their existing entitlements. Where this is not achieved, employees will lose entitlements and will be unambiguously worse off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are very surprised that the Democrats have agreed to these provisions. Senator Murray, in his Senate report on page 333, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's `sudden death' solution of deleting a wide range of award conditions in 18 months would breach the clear commitment of the Prime Minister in the lead up to the election when he clearly stated that . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Murray then quoted Mr Howard in the Freight Congress speech. Now we see the Democrats actively supporting the government in breaching this commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we oppose the transitional provisions outright. The sudden death approach to award simplification is wrong&mdash;the commission should be allowed to continue its job of simplifying awards. Given the change in the Democrats' position about this matter, we are not hopeful of succeeding in repealing the transitional provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have circulated two amendments to the transitional provisions which I would call on the Democrats to support. The first, on sheet 226, ensures that existing paid rates awards are not subject to the sudden death award simplification process. Given Senator Murray's comments about the harshness of that solution and the Democrats' alleged commitment to workers who rely on paid rates awards&mdash;like nurses and teachers&mdash;I would be surprised is the Democrats do not support this amendment. If Senator Murray says that the provisions he has agreed to will do this anyway, he is incorrect. As drafted, the only paid rates awards exempted from the transitional provisions are those made in future under section 170MX(3).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second amendment, on sheet 227, provides that consent awards are not subject to the sudden death solution. The deal provides that this is the case during the period <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the award was stated to be in effect. But consent awards continue in effect beyond that time, and should be free from award simplification for their effective life, not just their normal life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, I call on the Democrats to join with us in protecting the interests of all those employees, particularly those in the retail sector, who work under consent awards and who do not deserve to be worse off as a result of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have another two pages of comments relating to the remaining provisions of this schedule that I seek to incorporate in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. I will not be making any further comments on this schedule.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Gov/Dems (30)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whilst the Opposition recognises that the Government/Democrat deal improves the transitional provisions in some respects when compared to the provisions in the original bill, we remain fundamentally opposed to the transitional provisions and will vote against this amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have already explained why the Opposition is taking this position.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Opp (1)-(5) Sheet 226 {Division required}</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make some comments on the government-Democrat amendment No. 30. The opposition has put forward this amendment in an attempt to rectify what we see as a serious flaw in the government-Democrat agreement and the amendments that have arisen from it. Whilst I would very dearly like to make further comments with respect to the sudden death award simplification process, I will confine myself to what I call the sudden death consent award process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Sherry referred to the problem for vast numbers of retail industry employees covered by consent awards who, if amendment No. 30 goes ahead, will still be penalised because they entered into the enterprise bargaining process early by general industry standards and they undertook the choice&mdash;often the employer's choice&mdash;to ratify an <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> enterprise bargaining agreement as a consent award rather than as a certified agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to these consent awards there are two problems. With the proposed legislative regime, consent awards will not continue. In the future there will be no such thing as a consent award. One of the problems faced by workers currently covered by consent awards is included in amendment No. 30 as it stands. Only one of the problems highlighted during our inquiry has been rectified and another one has not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first of the problems was, under the original bill, those awards could be simplified by the sudden death provisions within 18 months despite the term of the agreement. In some cases the term of the agreement is around four years. Amendment No. 30 has dealt with that problem and introduced a provision which says, essentially, that for those workers their agreement cannot be reduced until the term of the agreement expires.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a fundamental problem which is going to be faced by retail workers&mdash;many of whom are not in a great bargaining position and are young women who face large corporations such as Coles Myers. At the expiry time, they are going to be at a significant disadvantage because, unlike certified agreements, the employer can allow the agreement to be minimised as would any award.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Murray would recall that there are many provisions included in these consent awards which may not come under allowable matters even though they have been improved to some extent with the agreement between the Democrats and the government. They include things such as health and safety provisions, rostered day off provisions and provisions for part-time workers in the retail industry which provide protection&mdash;they will no longer be allowable matters under awards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to remind Senator Murray of one of those&mdash;and there was clear evidence of this put before the committee&mdash;that is, the case of part-time workers in the retail industry being worked for 37 hours per week so that their employer could avoid the obligation of providing a rostered day off. Protections against those sorts of things will not survive <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5376"> in these consent awards once the nominal expiry date has been reached. The opposition's amendment No. 30 seeks to address this problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to acknowledge that, arising out of the committee inquiry process, Senator Murray for the Democrats supported the general principle that agreements should not be terminated at their expiry time and should continue. The majority of the committee found that `it was far more orderly and convenient for agreements once made to continue until amended by later agreement or by order of the commission'. This will not be the case with respect to current consent awards. They will be able to be reduced down to 20 allowable matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the Democrats for their success with the government in rectifying the situation in relation to certified agreements, but I call on the Democrats to support the opposition in relation to consent awards, which are essentially the same as certified agreements. I challenge some people to go back and look at some of the transcripts for the arguments put in cases before the commission that awards should be processed as consent awards. In many cases it was the employer's choice that they be consent awards rather than certified agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to highlight the magnitude that this seemingly small problem will have for some of Australia's largest industries and largest employers&mdash;and these were included in the SDA's submission in appendix I&mdash;that are currently under consent awards, which will be able to be minimised even under amendment No. 30 at their nominal expiry date. I refer to companies like BBC Hardware, Bi&hyphen;Lo, Coles supermarkets, Dulux, McDonalds, Franklins, Harris Scarse Ltd, KFC, K-Mart, Myer Grace Bros., Pizza Haven, Pizza Hut, Safeway, Harry Heaths, Hungry Jacks, Target, Woolworths and World 4 Kids.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Think of how many people are employed by these companies and ask yourselves: why has this agreement between the government and the Democrats allowed discrimination against these workers who are often not powerful, disadvantaged in a bargaining <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sense, young, generally women and employed on a part-time casual basis? Why are they being disadvantaged in their bargaining position?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now, in relation to some of the other amendments, I have heard some interesting excuses as to why we could not have equal remuneration, rather than equal pay, and why we could not deal with the particular problems in respect to outworkers in regard to right of entry and how the additional matter in the 20 allowable matters will mean very little if the union cannot not get right of entry to the distributors in the textile, clothing and footwear industry. I am interested to hear what the excuse is for clearly dealing only with part of the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consent rewards, which reflect enterprise bargaining agreements, will be able to be reduced to 20 allowable matter type awards at the expiry date of the agreement. So unlike those workers under certified agreements, these workers will face the reduction of their agreement at the end of its term.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GOVT/DEM 30</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new transitional arrangements differ from the old in several respects. It allows for consent awards made under enterprise bargaining principles to continue to their expiry. It allows for exceptional matters order. It amended items 43, 44 and 45 to provide more protection of paid rates employees. It adds two new criteria to the award simplification process. It adds a new item 45A in relation to the State awards. It adds a new item dealing with junior rates, 47(2). It allows the completion of Victorian 111(1A) applications. And, it amends item 43 to make it clear that employers must seek to reach agreement on the treatment of non-allowable matters before seeking to amend their awards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend these amendments to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What I want to talk about is in more general terms the award simplification process. The Democrats strongly support the maintenance of the award system. It is a system which, when running well, suits both employees and employers, particularly small employers, in providing a ready reference as to the state of the labour market.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But awards are immensely cumbersome documents. It is difficult to ask a small business employer to ensure that everything they do complies with a badly written 70 page commentary as many awards are. Badly written because each word has been haggled over and negated over decades. For almost a decade now, the AIRC has been trying to simplify and modernise awards. But, the AIRC has found it is much easier to put a clause in than to take a clause out, even a clause which has long outlived its usefulness.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats believe that to maintain support for the award system, it is essential that the award system be user friendly. The situation we have at present where there is probably hardly a small business employer in the country not in technical breach of at least some overprescriptive award clause, even if they are trying to do the right thing, is ludicrous. It is crucial, basic politics. Based on independent legal advice, we have been persuaded that the list of allowable matters as amended picks up all of the important industrial conditions. This, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> then should form the basis for an accelerated and more effective award simplification process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, there must be protections within that process. The object of this process is not to eliminate conditions, but to produce workable, effective documents that protect employees conditions but without placing excessive restrictions on employers. Five years into enterprise bargaining, as part of the evolution of the industrial relations system, now I believe is the appropriate time to review the award provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I said, we have sought to ensure that employees are protected. We have done this in several ways. First, item 43 makes it clear that the Commission cannot proceed to arbitrate on non-allowable matters until the applicant has made reasonable attempts to get agreement on both the award matter and the treatment or future regulation of the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Second, we have introduced the exceptional matters orders system to ensure that conditions that protect employees from harsh or unjust conditions can be retained.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Third, we have protections for paid rates workers, not just in the terms of their rates in items 43 and 45, but also in expanded access to arbitration under 170MX.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In short, we are persuaded that this transitional schedule offer the prospect of awards being reshaped around what independent experts tell us are the real core of the employment relationship in allowable matters, while ensuring that any other matters cannot be taken away unless the employee agrees or the Commission determined it would not be harsh or unjust. That, in our view, is a fair outcome.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to hear a government response to the matters that have been raised by Senator Sherry and Senator Collins. It is a very serious question indeed. The government is rather silent and I would like to hear its response, particularly in regard to those <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5378"> matters raised here on behalf of the retail employees by Senator Collins, the chair of the committee which investigated this matter thoroughly. It has been pointed out that there is a discrepancy, entailing clear discrimination against those employees who are currently covered by consent awards, as distinct from certified agreements. It just does not make sense to me for such discrimination to be allowed to be included in the final piece of legislation. So I would like to have the government explain to the committee why it would not agree to an amendment which would then exclude that discrimination which is going to be felt by quite a large number of those amongst the most vulnerable of employees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thought that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) had said that he wanted to see a situation in which no employee would be worse&hyphen;off as a result of this legislation. Here we have the potential for hundreds of thousands of employees to be worse&hyphen;off. We heard the government say over the weekend that it was concerned about low&hyphen;paid employees. Well, here we have a large number of employees who are low&hyphen;paid but they also have some fairly reasonable protection as a result of the consent awards that have been negotiated between the union concerned, the association and the employers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Collins has pointed out, the decision to go along the consent&hyphen;award track&mdash;rather than the certified&hyphen;agreement track&mdash;has often been determined by the wish of the employer concerned. Now we find that the government is not agreeing to an amendment that would cover that situation. I would like to hear why it is determined not to accept a reasonable proposition which would eliminate that sort of discrimination&mdash;just because an employee is now under a consent award, he or she would be discriminated against compared with the employees who are under a certified agreement.</PARA></SPEECH>

In the transitional period, parties can of course renegotiate consent awards as certified agreements. Where any unfairness does occur, the parties will of course have access to the exceptional matters orders. They are the government's main detailed responses to the concerns raised. The government's position, as made clear by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Minister for Industrial relations (Mr Reith), is that we want to make sure that no&hyphen;one is worse off, and that, indeed, the conditions of employment for Australian workers, particularly low paid workers, improve as a result of this law.

<TIME.STAMP>(12.56 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to that, I think at least for the record I need to highlight and challenge what is obviously the department's advice that consent orders are not entirely analogous to certified agreements, because in some cases they are. I would challenge the officers of the department to actually review some of the transcripts of hearings of matters which determined whether it was possible to proceed with an enterprise bargaining agreement under an application as a consent award. That sort of review would highlight that in some cases there is very little difference, apart from the fact of the past award coverage and the employer's preference. In some cases it may even just go down to the fact of the employer's preference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a sense, the approach that the commission took is that where the parties came together to the commission with an enterprise agreement and generally indicated that it was their preference that it be a consent award rather than a certified agreement, that is basically what happened. These are the people that are now going to be penalised. I heard the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) say last week that the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 was about agreement making. Why are we penalising those people who, several years ago, were busy agreement making? It is simply being done under what I would say is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5379"> poor departmental advice that they are not entirely analogous. I am sorry: that excuse is not good enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apart from that, the further explanation which Senator Campbell gave&mdash;that there can be a negotiation process over the period of time&mdash;ignores the logic that the Democrats argued about why certified agreements should not be able to be terminated at their expiry date. The same logic, I am afraid, applies to consent awards. I am interested, however, in Senator Campbell's comments about unfairness: that if there is unfairness, the parties can rely on the exceptional matters. I must say that this is the first occasion on which I have heard any description of any particular circumstance which might fit into an exceptional matter. I am pleased to hear that much at least, but I still must say that it is not good enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats have not responded to several requests in regard to this matter. I would have to say it will essentially be on their heads that up to 200,000 retail workers will be seriously disadvantaged in their negotiating position when they face their boss and their boss says, `Why should I? Why should I bother? If I just do nothing I can have all of these conditions removed.'</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So far every call we have made to the Australian Democrats to support us in improving this bill and in improving the lot of employees affected has regrettably fallen on deaf ears. This time I am again calling on the Democrats to support us in providing a measure of protection for independent contractors. These are small business people, vital to the economy of Australia, who need a range of protections.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senators will be aware that the bill repeals provisions in the existing act which give some protection to independent contractors. Independent contractors are becoming more and more common, especially in the building industry and the transport industry, but we are seeing the spread of the independent contract sector into other areas that have not been regarded as traditional.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As employers require their workers to incorporate and offer their services not as employees but as independent contractors they are invariably in a very weak bargaining position and need additional protections. We are opposed to the repeal of these existing provisions which permit the court to review contracts with independent contractors and to make orders relieving them of unfair contracts. These at very least provide an incentive to employers contracting with these people to do so on a fair basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are opposed to the repeal of the existing provisions which permit independent contractors to bring proceedings for the imposition of a penalty or for the recovery of wages under the act. Employees are able to bring these proceedings under the act and independent contractors who are, in substance, employees should have the same rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the need for protection of independent contractors does not end there. It has been brought to our attention, and I am sure to the attention of the government and Democrats, that independent contractors who bargain <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5381"> collectively, including by union representation, are at risk of being prosecuted under the collusive bargaining provisions of the Trade Practices Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many independent contractors are forced to incorporate. They should have the right to bargain collectively without being caught up by these collusive conduct provisions. The opposition is therefore seeking to insert a new provision into the Trade Practices Act which ensures that contracts which are wholly or principally for the performance of work&mdash;that is, the contracts of independent contractors&mdash;are not subject to the collusive bargaining provisions of the Trade Practices Act. Thus, independent contractors who bargain collectively will not be open to penalty under the Trade Practices Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We call on the Democrats to give thoughtful consideration to this amendment. We call on the government to do the same. Help us redress the bargaining imbalance between independent contractors and those who seek their services.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Schedule 6 repeals the provisions incorporating the 1993 Industrial Relations Reform Act which allows the industrial relations court to deal with a limited range of unfair contract disputes, particularly in relation to the review by the court of a contract for the performance of work by an independent contractor on the grounds that it is harsh or unfair.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The existing provisions are important. They are important to prevent exploitation of individuals in circumstances where their status as an independent contractor is used by the employer to avoid obligations which would otherwise arise under an award. It is not good enough to put people on a contract just to limit wages and conditions and there certainly seems to be evidence that this is happening in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the opposition's moves to oppose items 1 to 4, you will notice that it is the same as the Greens, who would certainly be supporting that. We will certainly be supporting an alternative definition of `contract of services', as with the opposition's amendments 62 and 63, which effectively states `includes any contract or agreement which is wholly or principally for the performance of work by one party to the contract'. We fully support the ALP amendments in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue of contracting as opposed to employing is going to become more prevalent and we should all be ensuring some form of protection in this bill for workers under contracts of services. In this instance the Democrats do not have any amendments to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5382"> this schedule and their position is unclear. It would be very good to get clarification of whether or not the issues that have come up in relation to contractors have been taken into account.</PARA></SPEECH>

<STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(1.19 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Democrats will support the Labor Party's amendment 57 on independent contractors. The Democrats supported the inclusion of provisions in the IR Act in 1992 to protect independent contractors against unfair contracts. This is a growing sector of the work force as increasingly employers convert employees, often in our view against their will, into so-called contractors in an effort to reduce costs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One way of reducing costs by employers by moving employees to contractors is to avoid payment of PAYE tax. If a contractor is regarded as a business person, they fall under PPS or provisional tax, not PAYE, and that saves the employers but costs the taxpayers. I am surprised that this government and Treasurer Costello with his commitment not to stand by and see the tax system riddled and rorted has not cracked down on tax avoidance by employers forcing employees to become contractors. In seeking to abolish these provisions, the government is effectively sanctioning employers to continue to undertake these conversions by not only allowing tax avoidance to grow but by insulating employers from action by contractors for unfair contracts other than by under the very strict and difficult regime of the common law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also surprised that the coalition is opposed to the retention of these provisions given they are largely modelled on the jurisdiction against unfair contracts introduced by the  Greiner conservative government in New South Wales in 1991 and by the very conservative Bjelke&hyphen;Petersen government in 1988. The existence of provisions in industrial law to provide some protection to independent contractors is not therefore unusual.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The provisions in the IR Act in our view have not been as helpful as we had hoped. Since 1992 there have only been a handful of cases, maybe 20, under these provisions. That is hardly great comfort to the hundreds of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> thousands of workers now on contracts, most of them forced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my supplementary report on the Senate inquiry I propose an alternative approach of moving the prohibition against unfair contracts to the Trade Practices Act, providing for industry codes of practice, a small claims procedure and the implementation of unconscionable conduct provisions. These sorts of provisions have worked very effectively for other small businesses such as the motor trades. Again I was disappointed that the coalition is not prepared to match its rhetoric and treat independent contractors as small businesses needing appropriate protection&mdash;that is, if they refuse to regard them as employees under the Industrial Relations Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats believe that our proposal offered more protection than that provided by the cumbersome, high cost and legally difficult provisions in this act. We intend continuing to pursue those changes in the Trade Practices Act. In the interim we will vote to retain the current provisions, ensuring that independent contractors at least are afforded some legal protection from unfair contracts. For those reasons, we will be supporting the Labor Party.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(1.22 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the opposition's amendment which opposes and deletes the repeal of the proposed section put forward by the coalition. The difficulties these provisions present to the thousands of contractors in industry, whether it be construction or transport, are quite obvious.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst I welcome the Australian Democrats' support for this amendment, this amendment is not enough in itself to protect these independent contractors; it does need to go further. Subsequent opposition amendments to schedule 6 provide for the necessary support and will put in place the necessary mechanisms to make that protection complete and unambiguous. Whilst it is a very positive move to retain these provisions in the current bill, there will still remain some ambiguity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make reference specifically to some of the concerns and issues in industry. There is a push, certainly from many large employers&mdash;sometimes in specific sectors in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5383"> industry; others more generally&mdash;to force on to contracts independent contractors who would by general definition in fact be employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is acknowledged certainly by workers' representatives and unions in industry that the current provisions under 127A, 127B and 127C are in fact quite complex and do not go far enough in providing the necessary protection to those workers. The pressure is not going away and there are going to be more and more problems facing independent contractors in these areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The so-called enterprise that establishes them, basically under duress by employers, is really starting to change the nature of industry. It certainly has been noted that in the construction industry this transition from employees to independent contractors over a long period of time&mdash;but gathering momentum more recently&mdash;will really change the way in which those workers are capable of maintaining a reasonable income and a fair and a living wage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One example of this is what is happening in the housing sector of the construction industry. I would like to ask the government what advice specifically they took from the Housing Industry Association on the repeal of the unfair contracts provision. I would like to refer to a letter from Clarendon Homes that demands all subcontractors become proprietary limited companies. Clarendon Homes say that subcontractors should set up their own companies to `avoid union interference in the subcontract system'. In a 1991 letter, Clarendon offered to help workers set up their companies. Clarendon said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have approached a firm which specialises in the setting up of companies and secured a discounted rate of about $700 per company. You can choose your own name for your company for an extra $50. To help with the cost of setting up, Clarendon will deduct from your contract payment the $700 in three equal instalments.</PARA>
<PARA>How does the company explain this to the workers they are forcing to become companies? They say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now I know you are all grumbling and saying, `Why should I?' But remember, this is union driven and we don't have any choice; it must happen. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>Do they give subcontractors any choice in the matter? On this issue they say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To make sure you continue to receive regular work from us you will have to become a proprietary limited company by 15 December 1992. Our supervisors will not be able to give any work to subcontractors who are not in the company structure after that date.</PARA>
<PARA>What sort of contract can building subcontractors be expected to sign? It just so happens that I have an example here. For $18 per hour the subcontractor gets no rostered days off, no travel allowance, no payment for public holidays, no annual leave, no sick leave, no wet weather allowance, no picnic days, no superannuation and the subcontractor must supply his or her own tools and equipment, including light power tools, to carry out and complete the said works. Is that fair?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Does the Industrial Relations Act, with all these coalition amendments, render it possible for people to seek adequate redress? No. Even the retention of 127A, 127B and 127C, as this amendment puts forward, is not going to be enough.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7G6">Senator LUNDY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not going to be enough. The amendments the opposition has proposed with respect to independent contractors form a package that will remove this outstanding ambiguity. The amendments will provide adequate redress for a growing group of workers who are under extreme pressure, as I have just described, to change the way they earn their living. More responsibility is being placed on them although they are still employees. This is acknowledged by Clarendon in the example I have just provided. Clarendon acknowledges the fact that they retain the liability for workers compensation. Their contract states, `We agree to pay your workers compensation policy.' That definition of employees under workers compensation has been a crucial one in the never ending dispute and saga with respect to independent contractors and it provides a clear insight into this government's agenda with respect to independent contractors.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to say a few things about this. I am glad to see Senator Murray is  supporting the opposition and the Greens (WA) on this. I think when he does support us we ought to give him some thanks for that, because he has been getting a fair deal of stick, if I can use that expression, Senator Murray, and they are often difficult decisions to make.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Listening to what Senator Lundy and Senator Conroy said, this is one of the big issues in this legislation. It is a problem that has been growing for years. There are cases such as the Odco case. That was a very prominent case and one you will remember. May I say just as a passing reference that it was the first case my son, Sean, ever instructed in. It was wrong, because he was on the losing side. I always thought the bench was a bit astray there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand the government's position on this. This legislation moves further along the line of industrial legislation in this country being supported more by provisions in the constitution other than that which refers to the settlement of interstate disputes. For example, it relies more on the corporations power. If you were to give independent contractors&mdash;they are vulnerable, for the reasons that have been given already&mdash;protection under this act, would that not be more consistent with the underlying constitutional bases this act will now have than has previously been the case? In other words, would not giving protection to independent contractors be more consistent with the way this act is going?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why is the government not taking this opportunity that is now presented to it by shifting to new bases for the legislation to look after independent contractors, who in very many cases are in identical positions to that of employees&mdash;except for very fine lines drawn, usually as a matter of evidence, trying to distinguish between employees and independent contractors.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will respond to a couple of points and will keep my comments as brief as I can. Firstly, I refer to the question Senator Cooney raised. On the workplace relations <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5386"> bill&mdash;I took advice on this, it seems like a few months ago&mdash;Senator Cook raised a question about the heads of power the bill relied on. I do not want to encourage Senator Cook to come back and have a debate on this, but he did agree with me privately that, indeed, the corporations power had been relied upon under the so-called  Brereton IR reform bill of 1993. So there is not a new head of power. That was a misconception. Senator Cooney, I do not think&mdash;I have not taken advice on this&mdash;that we would go around doing the things you want us to do just to flesh out use of that particular head of power.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, if workers are employees, as you have described them, they would indeed be covered by the workplace relations act. A worker does not cease to be an employee merely because he or she has entered a so-called sham incorporation arrangement. On the point that Senator Conroy makes relating to this so-called hidden agenda about the revenue and undermining the PAYE tax system: it would be a fascinating conspiracy in politics if we were seeking to undermine the revenue. It is entirely counter to the entire budget strategy. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that Senator Lundy and Senator Conroy share the same concerns about the tax base, the revenue and the budget when the budget bills come on for debate tomorrow and the next few days. I hope they are concerned to make sure that the tax base, the revenue and other measures in the budget can go through this place in absolute integrity so there is no temptation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the record, it should be noted that there has been only one government and one Treasurer in the history of Australia that has worked very, very hard to introduce a consumption tax. If you read John Edwards's exceptional biography of the former Prime Minister and Treasurer, you would believe that the former Treasurer was very committed to a consumption tax. Indeed, from my knowledge of history, he was the only Treasurer who worked very hard to introduce one. The now Treasurer (Mr Costello) has made quite clear his views about a GST.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only other point I want to respond to, since I have been provoked into making a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> response, is Senator Lundy's putting the case about people being forced to become incorporated. It is a shame that Senator Lundy was not here&mdash;I am sure Senator Cooney will remind her, as he was a diligent member of the select committee on the land fund bill&mdash;when we had a long debate at that stage about what we in opposition thought was a very wrong move in forcing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians to be incorporated if they wanted to receive assistance from the land fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was not Clarendon Homes forcing people to be incorporated if they wanted assistance and support; this was the Australian government&mdash;the Australian Labor Party at that time&mdash;forcing probably the most disadvantaged people in the country to become incorporated if they wanted to receive assistance under that legislation.

These amendments to the Trade Practices Act are very important. I understand the Democrats are not going to support them. That is a grave disappointment to us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Murray made the point in his earlier contribution that we did not have this particular provision in our 1993 amendments. That is correct, Senator Murray, but over the last few years it has become apparent, firstly, that the so&hyphen;called independent contractors are spreading and, therefore, the protection they need needs to be clearer and, secondly, the Trade Practices Act has not yet been used in this area. It seems to us, looking into the future, that it will be. So we appeal to you, Senator Murray, to change your position and support us on these amendments.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer to opposition amendments <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Nos 62 and 63. The Democrats do have some sympathy with these amendments but we believe they will not achieve the objective that the ALP has for them. The objective is to ensure that valid collective bargaining by independent contractors against a single employer or employer association is not subject to the price fixing and other competition policy rules of the Trade Practices Act. We support that, but the reliance on the words `contract of service' becomes very inappropriate. On the one hand, there is no question that owner&hyphen;drivers all wearing the TNT badge and all working solely for TNT should be able to bargain collectively with TNT, but somewhere along the spectrum it becomes inappropriate because, on the other hand, when roof tilers, for example, collude to set a single high inflated price for roof tiling across Sydney, it is not right. More seriously, when professionals such as doctors and lawyers on contracts of service seek to slide into these provisions to avoid the operational competition policy, it becomes wholly inappropriate. In short, I do not believe that these provisions will work or are appropriate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our preferred approach is the development of industry codes of practices which might include guidelines on price. Even under the current Trade Practices Act this can be done and given an authorisation under section 88. In our discussions with the ACCC it has been made clear that the ACCC has no interest in pursuing owner&hyphen;drivers or other workers working closely akin to employees, but where genuine collective bargaining slips into punitive price fixing, the ACCC is interested. I would suggest to unions and their representatives here that they pursue the authorisation of industry codes as the better approach than the amendment being sought by the ALP with its much wider implications.</PARA></SPEECH>

In fact, if the collusion is there, it is not because people are bad but because, in a very competitive industry, if the law allows you to take certain actions to decrease your ongoing costs, that is what will happen. It is not because people are bad; it is because transport and building have become very competitive. The reality is that no business will be able to stand up and give their workers a fair go if it is possible under the law for them to reduce their wages and conditions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations. I refer to your government's miserable proposal for an $8 a week pay rise for a minority of Australian workers. Do you recall Mr Reith saying on 25 June last year that if low paid workers receive $14 per week increase for each of the next three years, as proposed by the previous Labor government, they would still be worse off in real terms? How can your government then maintain that over the next three years a worker receiving an $8 a week increase will not be worse off in real terms?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to that question is: no, I do not remember Mr Reith saying that. I will deal with the substance of the question and that is whether workers will benefit from an increase of $8 a week over each of the next three years. The answer is, overwhelmingly, they will.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we know, inflation is currently at historic low levels. What we need to achieve is a level of wage increases that will not jeopardise that low inflation environment, and that is what this proposal does. Low paid workers can have confidence that the government will not ignore their needs and circumstances. Indeed, it was, of course, open to us to range far and wide in terms of the submission we <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> made. I think you will find that we are much more generous in our approach than some others who have made submissions. We have not put in the usual ambit claim that the ACTU put in to all these sorts of applications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have done is strike a balance that does ensure that the lowest paid do have the safety net, do have the ability to get an increase irrespective of their capacity to bargain but at the same time not put at risk any of the gains that flow from low inflation. Quite clearly, to the extent that inflation starts to get out of control and causes interest rates to rise, once again you are putting job creation and current employment at risk. Our submission will propose that workers whose award rates of pay are below average weekly ordinary time earnings&mdash;approximately $670 per week&mdash;should have access to the $8 a week increase. With absorption against over&hyphen;award payments and outcomes from enterprise agreements&mdash;</PARA>

There will simply be a new role for the award system as an effective safety net for the low paid, and I can assure you that low paid workers will continue to achieve improvements in wages by making agreements with their employers. The ACTU's centralised approach to this particular claimant, and presumably others in the future, is not the way to go. The way the government has approached this is to strike a figure that does indeed ensure that those workers will be fully protected.</PARA></TALK.START></ANSWER>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will repeat it, Madam President. The Howard coalition government is pleased that we are able to deliver low inflation, moderate wages growth and two official drops in interest rates in such a short period of time in government. That is clearly good news for all Australians. What is pleasing is that surveys are starting to indicate a growing consumer confidence as a result of a government that has been prepared to take the hard decisions and to give Australian business, in particular small business, the chance to grow and to employ more Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members of the Labor Party want to dismiss it. I remind them of the Westpac&hyphen;Melbourne Institute index published on 14 November, which said that consumer sentiment leapt 8.3 points to almost 110 points in November, hitting a five-month high, with Sydney leading the way at an index rating of over 116 points. Westpac's General Manager, Economics, Bill Evans, said the response was `remarkably strong'. That is Australians responding to good economic management. It is interesting to see that 58 per cent believed that it was a good time to buy major household items, which represents the highest degree of confidence in over two years. That is good news.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Roy Morgan survey put out last week found that 35 per cent of those surveyed believed that they would be better off next year under a coalition government. An employment agency survey by the Manpower organisation was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> on 19 November. Malcolm Jackman, Manpower's MD, said&mdash;listen to this Labor&mdash;that the positive effects of the Howard-Costello budget are starting to be felt in the business community and should flow on to increased employment next year. He said he was seeing clients with a lot of confidence with business people still talking about growth and that no-one is downsizing for downsizing's sake. He is very optimistic&mdash;in particular, Senator Alston&mdash;about the telecommunications industry, forecasting the hiring of 123,000 people <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5391"> over the next three years. That is good news for Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Morgan and Banks surveyed 3,200 organisations with more than a million employees. It reported on 13 November for the first time in the last 18 months that there has been an increase in the net hiring plans of business. The survey found that over 32 per cent of those businesses expect to add employees and 86 per cent of businesses with up to 30 staff expect steady or improved employment conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So as a result of good government and as a result of a government that was prepared to take the hard decisions in a budget, business confidence and consumer confidence are growing. That gives Australians a lot of hope for the future. What is important now is that this Senate respond to the same sentiment, respond to what Australia is asking of it&mdash;that is, to endorse and support the program that the government has put before the parliament, to support the budget in particular, to let us implement the decisions that we have made in that difficult but well supported budget, to get the workplace relations bill through, to get the budget bills through, to enable this confidence to build and to get more employment growth in the next 12 months.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

In relation to the benefits of competition policy, I hark Senator Cook back to my earlier comments about his government being very concerned to improve and develop competition policies in Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is answering the question. Through those sorts of measures, we hope to provide a more productive economy which can better compete on world markets.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am rather surprised that Senator Cook, who is now writing articles for newspapers dealing with a range of policy issues, raises questions about competition policy and the benefits that a sound competition policy can deliver to this country. I am very surprised that he has raised that particular issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as the creation of jobs is concerned, that was a dilemma which the previous government had in spades. It had 13 years to develop a policy which could deliver real jobs in this country. You and your ministers, many of whom still litter the opposition frontbench, presided over the worst recession in 60 years and so many jobs were lost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just to summarise, Senator Cook, we would hope that the creation of a more competitive economy, among other things, will assist in delivering considerable benefits to consumers and will allow Australia to compete better on <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5392"> world markets.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to report to the Senate that the most recent mining mission that I led to India was very successful for both India and Australia. I was accompanied by 12 representatives of business interests in Australia. Over a seven&hyphen;day period meetings were held in Delhi, Mumbai and Calcutta with senior ministers, senior government officials and private sector companies. I was accompanied by expertise from Australia which ranged from exploration, feasibility studies, mine development, transportation, electricity generation, materials handling and of course mine technology.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were two major areas of interest for both Indians and Australians and they covered coking coal and thermal coal. It was particularly pleasing for me to be there in regard to coking coal because it was just 20 years ago that I in fact signed the first contract with the Steel Authority of India for the sale of coking coal. From a modest 200,000 tonnes of coal in 1976, we have seen sales grow to around nine million tonnes in 1996.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Alston. I will take that interjection. This shows that India is now the second biggest market for coking coal outside Japan. Compared with other Asian countries, the Indians take 98 per cent of their imports of coking coal from Australia. From the discussions I had with them they were very pleased with both the quality and the reliability of supply, although I might say that the latter was marred to a small extent by one of the Indian agents asking me why there was a strike at a particular supplier's mine because the company dared to write and communicate with its own employees and suffered a 14&hyphen;day strike.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of greater importance to the Australian coking coal industry are the Indian projections that over the next five to six years they intend to increase their coking coal imports by 100 per cent, from nine million tonnes a year to 18 million tonnes a year. This is good news for the Australian coking coal industry. In respect of steaming or thermal coal, the Indian authorities made it very clear that to meet their energy demands they will need to increase their capacity by about 10,000 to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5393"> 12,000 megawatts a year per year for the next 10 years. This is an enormous ask because, if you put it into Australian terms, that means three Eraring power stations every year for the next 10 years, but it does open up big opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Indian government owned and operated Coal India supplies just over 400 million tonnes. It is worth mentioning that because it is often thought that Australia is the largest coal producer in the world. It is not, but it is certainly the largest coal exporter. While the Indian coals are low in sulfur, they are very high in ash. The opportunities it opens up for Australia are direct supply of Australian thermal coal, blending of our lower Australian coals with high ash indigenous coals, cooperation between Australia and India in the supply of technology, for example in washeries where they have no experience, and infrastructure planning. A major impediment is the size of their ports, the capacity of their ports and the participation and development of India's own coal resources. This represents major opportunities for Australian companies and of course major challenges for both India and Australia.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

Nevertheless, as the Australian government noted, the Malaysian government had in turn made a clear decision on 4 November that the conference could not go ahead.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Senator Eggleston, for that question and the answer is, yes, I can. Last Thursday I relaunched the job placement, employment and training program in Mornington, Victoria, at one of the new program sites. The programs will operate across Australia, from places such as Mount Gravatt in Brisbane across to Wanneroo in Perth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is determined to raise the understanding of issues involving young Australians generally, to celebrate their successes, to listen to them and to ensure that all young people have the opportunity to participate to the best of their abilities. However, as I have said in this place before, sadly today a number of young people live in circumstances that are far from ideal, and the government is determined to ensure that these young people are given a helping hand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The re-establishment of the JPET scheme is a very important part of our commitment. With funding of $11 million per annum for the next two years, the scheme will assist young people who are homeless or at risk of becoming so. The JPET program provides funding to services to help disadvantaged young Australians who are facing barriers to employment, education and training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the barriers to participation is homelessness. Homeless young people are often without any family support, and the government is committed to addressing their needs and has increased assistance to them through programs such as JPET. Many of the young people being helped by this service have left school early or have been wards of the state and some are ex-offenders. Reinstatement of the JPET program is a very important step in providing a range of support and assistance to meet these most disadvantaged young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I anticipate that the program will be fully operational early next year and will fund somewhere between 80 and 100 organisations to provide support to about 4,000 young people each year. JPET services will assist unemployed young people, students, young <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5397"> refugees, young people in state care or those about to exit from it and young ex-offenders. It provides a holistic approach to assisting people under 21, particularly those in the 15 to 19 age group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The program will offer ongoing support and referral services for young people with problems, including a lack of suitable housing, substance abuse, sexual or other abuse, lack of self esteem and financial difficulties. Once the underlying problems are addressed, participants in the program will be assisted in their efforts to gain access to education, entry level training or employment and will be supported to maintain their participation in these activities. It is the government's hope that JPET services such as these will help many young people realise their full potential and enable them to plan their futures with confidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of other initiatives that this government is taking to assist young people, not the least of which is tackling youth unemployment by reducing the budget deficit and creating a climate for sustained economic growth, thereby keeping pressure off interest rates, reforming industrial relations law, reducing paperwork on small business, introducing a modernised Australian apprentice and traineeship scheme, introducing the green corps and, very importantly, ensuring that young people entering the work force have the literacy and other communications skills essential for getting and keeping a job. All of those things, combined with the reintroduction of the JPET scheme, auger very well for opportunities created by this government for young Australians.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. What priority does the Prime Minister intend to give to promoting and advancing human rights in his discussions with the President of the United States, Mr Clinton, with the head of state of China, Jiang Zemin, and with other heads of Asian governments at the APEC summit next week?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I might address the background of the policy of the government and the attitude of the government to this very important matter. The promotion and protection of human rights are certainly an inseparable part of the government's foreign policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The human rights policy is pursued on the basis that the promotion and protection of human rights serves Australia's broader national economic and security interest and that human rights are both universal and indivisible, as enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights instruments. It is to that background that at the APEC meeting which, as the honourable senator knows, is primarily an economic forum no doubt the Prime Minister will be addressing these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian government does use a range of different opportunities to advance its position on human rights and try to influence a better outcome from those who may not be adhering to the standards of the international declaration, at least to the minimum international standards that the international community accepts. It is done through the bilateral fora, such as I think is the opportunity Senator Harradine sees in this forum, through multilateral fora and through, whenever possible, the strengthening of institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I presume, if I am correctly interpreting the honourable senator's question, that the reference to the United States President and the President of China is suggesting that the Prime Minister should raise China's human rights record again with the President of China and perhaps speak on the same issue <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> with the President of the United States.

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, my attention has been drawn to press reporting of what Mr Abbott said in that respect. He, I think, was simply indicating that skillshare is a very respected program. That is why, in allocating what skillshare funding could be distributed and how, I took the opportunity to appoint an independent committee with George Polites, who was appointed chair of the CESAC review by your government, with David Thompson, the national president of the skillshare association, and of course representatives of my department.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As you would well know, Senator Foreman, it is very important when these decisions are made that they are open and clear and there for everybody to see. As you also know, there is not a skillshare provider I believe who will look you in the eye and say that they are all as good as each other. They freely admit, especially the better ones of course, that some skillshare providers are better than others. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5400"> That was the purpose of establishing this independent review committee with the president of the national skillshare association to give them the opportunity to sort out who were the good ones, who did we want to help ensure they survive. That is why that committee was set up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The funding has been allocated and there has been very little complaint about reductions in funding. No-one welcomes that at all. No-one ever welcomes getting less Commonwealth money. It probably comes as no surprise to you that no minister enjoys telling people that they are going to get less. But, when you come from the side of government that you come from that went on a spend, spend, spend with Beazley's Bankcard running up into billions of dollars, sooner or later you get kicked out of office because the community says that you have made a mess and it wants someone else to fix it up. The community wants people who are prepared to take the hard decisions to get these things fixed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That meant that skillshare, along with a lot of other providers across my portfolio and others, had to bear some of the pain of the mess that your former government created. We are prepared to make the hard decisions to fix up that mess. But I make no bones about it. Skillshare are, relatively speaking, good providers. That is why an independent committee was set up&mdash;so that the good providers would be rewarded, not the ones who were not pulling their weight.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I certainly think Senator Allison is correct in saying that there ought to be a fundamentally different regime after 1 July next year.

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a lot of Australia that still does not have access to pay television, to lower telephone charges, to interactive broadband services, and they are still very keen to have it. Indeed if you talk to some of my country colleagues, they will say, `If only we had overhead towers and cable.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But let me address the issue in more detail. The fact is that it is very important to remember that we are currently dealing with commercial arrangements that have been in place now for some five years. If you go back, you will find that on a number of occasions Labor in government had the opportunity to tighten the system, to somehow stop what was happening before it really got off the ground. But we are now about three-quarters of the way through the game and it is certainly too late <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5401"> in the piece to be moving the goal posts and jeopardising something like $3 billion to $4 billion worth of roll&hyphen;out by each of the two players.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not accept the proposition that somehow it is wasteful duplication to have facilities&hyphen;based competition, indeed nor does the OECD. There have been a number of studies done on this which show that particularly in relation to telecommunications the dead hand of having a single utility providing infrastructure facilities is about the best way possible to ensure that work practices and other very expensive cost factors make the whole service very much more expensive than it needs to be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what you need to do is proceed against the background of the green light that was given up until 1 July and then seek to ameliorate the impact on residents against that background. That is what we are doing. We understand that there is genuine community concern. But the answer to that is not to simply go in there with a sledgehammer and tell Telstra what to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra is rolling out its broadband and cable television services primarily underground. It is doing it in relation to pay television on behalf of a joint venture, which involves News Corporation. So it is not simply a government monopoly rolling out money using taxpayers' dollars; it is doing it as part of a commercial consortium. Clearly you have to have regard for the implications of any heavy&hyphen;handed intervention that might adversely affect either Optus Vision or Foxtel in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the answer is not simply to give Telstra directions which would fundamentally cripple its capacity to compete. We do want to see people have a competitive choice. We do want to see lower prices for all of these services. We do want people to get fast access to the Internet. We do want the clever country to occur here. The best way to do that is to have competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To the extent that there are commercial outcomes that can be negotiated between the players, we encourage that. Indeed, not only since the election but also even in our election commitment we said that we would <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> explore all possible ways of minimising duplication. I have on a number of occasions since that time had discussions with the carriers. I have written to them. I have called them together to go through the various options. That is the extent of our capacity to intervene in something that is well down the track, unless you take the view that somehow you do not give a damn for what has already been invested&mdash;that you are not interested in the benefits that flow from that competition. We are not in that category. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp), to a question without notice asked by Senator Cook today, relating to the effects of competition policy on rural and regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>Today I asked Senator Kemp a question on competition policy. I asked him that question directly because the Leader of the National Party in this place, Senator Boswell, had obviously sought to undermine the government's position on competition policy by alleging, as has been widely reported, that jobs would be lost and there would be a giant vacuum cleaner sucking jobs out of rural and regional Australia, to quote the remarks attributed to Senator Boswell.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question I asked of Senator Kemp was: could he tell us how many jobs were lost? Senator Kemp, in his primary answer, dodged that question. He did not answer that question.

Although it has been vocal on reef tax and while it has certainly suggested that the government will change its position on reef tax, so far it has not succeeded. I hope it succeeds on the reef tax, I might add very quickly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very important that this nation knows where it goes at all levels of government in this country when it comes to the implementation of the important reforms on national competition policy. A government pursuing those reforms should be able to say where it believes there will be greater efficiencies and enhanced competitiveness in the Australian economy because of those reforms. We do not pursue change on national competition policy for the sake of national competition policy. We pursue it for the sake of economic growth for not only better income levels in the economy but also more jobs for ordinary Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this government remains silent on the point of what jobs will come from this important reform, then either the government has not given the thought necessary to carry the reform through and succeed&mdash;or it is at least opening itself and exposing its flank to be attacked by the National Party to bring those reforms down&mdash;or it is enabling the states to crawl out of the commitments that they have made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a gaping hole in one of the areas of this budget the government so loudly lauds <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in this chamber: there are no forecasts in the budget that has been brought down this year on where the jobs growth will be. There is no forecast on what the outcome for employment for Australians will be. The government keeps telling us this is a well received budget. It is not well received by the unemployed; there is no guidance there. It is not well received by the marginally employed who look at the prospects of a slow economy with slack demand creating more unemployment in their areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here the government is pushing an important reform from the foundation&mdash;strong and true&mdash;of bipartisan support. But it needs to make the case in the terms of not, `We want competition policy,' but where the jobs are. If it cannot answer the allegation made by Senator Boswell, it really ought to close up shop and hand it back to someone who can make that case and can pursue those reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I particularly want to know how many jobs there will be in Western Australia. The Court government in Western Australia&mdash;which has prematurely gone to the polls just this week&mdash;for the first time since the war before Christmas wants to argue that this government cannot show what those employment figures really are. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wonder whether I should not remind you, Senator West, of your government's attitude to the national competition policy. Of course, our government is strongly committed to fostering competition in markets for goods and services. Three competition policy intergovernmental agreements were entered into by the Commonwealth, states and territories in&mdash;wait for it, Senator West&mdash;April 1995 at the Council of Australian Government's meeting. These were the conduct code agreement, the competition principles agreement and the agreement to implement the national competition policy and related reforms.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator West, there are two reasons why you are worried about rural and regional Australia. One is that you barely hold a seat in this area. The electors looked at your lot after 13 years and decided what a hopeless bunch of people you are, with no interest in the interests of rural people. I know, Senator West, you are one of the few people on your side&mdash;I acknowledge this&mdash; <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> who will get up and attempt to speak on behalf of rural and regional Australia. Regrettably, you do not do it all that well, but I acknowledge that it is an interest, unlike the shadow minister for primary industry who, as Senator Herron has reminded us, has barely asked a question in this area. I understand your concern. If I were you, Senator West, I would try to convince your own party room to take an interest in regional and rural issues. That is what I would do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My final point is that there was an attempt to quote Senator Boswell. I naturally said that I am loath to accept any quotes which are forthcoming on the chance that they may be slightly selective and may leave out something important. Senator Boswell informed me that he said of the same program that there were benefits out of a national competition policy. That was actually missed in the question. It has, again, been a very poor performance by the Labor Party. They are flip flopping all over the place. Senator West, do you support national competition policy, or not? Senator Cook thinks he does. He thinks it should be bipartisan. No&hyphen;one who listened to your remarks could draw any conclusion other than that you are utterly opposed to national competition policy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Kemp is correct. It was a bipartisan approach in relation to competition policy and I think that is the problem. There was almost no debate during the time. I have to say that Senator Boswell is being absolutely consistent. I sat in the hearings with Senator Boswell who asked numerous questions of those giving evidence to the inquiry, expressing the concern of rural and regional Australia. Unfortunately, in the case of the National Party it did not follow through to the point of them standing up for that position in the Senate when it was voted on, as did the Greens.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5406"> The situation is that we are now beginning to see what governments in the states can and will do with competition policy. We are now beginning to see the huge amount of power that we have given to the Australian Competi tion and Consumer Commission. It is like a monster for which there is no real control at this stage. We are beginning to see questions of very narrow definition of public interest which go round in a circle and say, `The public interest is competition; therefore, the public interest is competition.' We end up with a situation where other human values in society do not get a guernsey.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, at the end of that committee process, short though it was for competition policy, the response from the committee was that the committee recommends that the bill be passed without amendment. That is a real pity because we are now beginning to see in state elections all throughout the country that, where there are conservative governments, you get the ALP in those states criticising the implementation of competition policy because they can see how much damage it can have and how different it can be between perceptions of public interest, the reality&mdash;outcomes for people, for services, employment&mdash;and the impact on rural and regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is time for us to revisit this. The fact that we are having this debate is at least a useful step, but we all have to admit that it was pushed through last year. In this chamber in July last year some of us thought that we should not have been pushing it through. Others thought it should not have been in that form, but the reality is it is a time bomb which will be ticking up until 1998 and, unless there are specific exemptions for federal, state and local government, that time bomb will go off in 1998. All of those areas of public service provisions&mdash;outsourcing, privatisation and so on&mdash;will occur by that date unless we as a Senate go back and look at the monster we have created, to see what the problems are before it is too late. My plea is now that we have more of these debates. Instead of attacking Senator Boswell for the way he did not vote, at least applaud him for having the guts to stand up and speak for what a lot of people are saying in the community.</PARA>

What I was saying to the state governments was, `You can take the sting out of the competition policy; it is within your power as state governments and members of state governments to do that.' That is the direction I took. I acknowledged that there were problems for the bush, but I did say that there would be benefits flowing for them as well.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The National Party has consistently been used as a doormat by the Liberals since the election. If ever I saw proof of it, it was the doorstop interview done by the Leader of the National Party, Mr Tim Fischer, the Deputy Prime Minister, on the diesel fuel rebate scheme. He rushed out to the side door of the ministerial wing entrance&mdash;to the great chagrin, I am told, of many regional members of the Liberal Party&mdash;and claimed the entire credit for the National Party. He said that it was a huge victory for the National Party to save the diesel fuel rebate scheme after five months of destabilising public debate when it was under real threat. So the great victory of the National Party was to protect against the Liberal Party a program which the Labor Party had kept in place in its whole 13 years of government. What a huge victory, Senator Boswell!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But have a look at what has happened since. In response to an interjection from Senator Panizza, which was responded to by Senator Schacht, about what we did to the ABC when we were in government, I say to him that we expanded the services of the ABC. Do not be such an ignoramus! To my great chagrin, as Senator Schacht said quite correctly, programs which we funded in government to expand the services of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5408"> ABC in places like the Northern Territory have since been axed by this government. Go and talk to the people in the small communities in the Northern Territory who were really looking forward to getting Triple J, which we had announced and funded, but who will now not get it because the expansion program has been axed. That is one thing the National Party should not have let the Liberals get away with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will tell you, Senator Boswell, the other thing the National Party should not have let them get away with&mdash;axing the BARA program, which I referred to in question time today in a question to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron), who has nothing to do with this portfolio despite what he thinks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The business advice for rural areas program was a highly successful program that this government put into place. In an assessment that was made of the last financial year alone, it created an estimated 1,400 jobs in country Australia and set up a huge number of small businesses. I saw the work the BARA office did in the town of Katherine in the Northern Territory. It delivered great value for money. But what did this government do? It abolished it in the budget. It closed it down. A service that rural Australia once got and that measurably provided benefits is now being removed from rural Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last Friday, the minister for aboriginal affairs, in what he himself described as a major speech outlining new directions for Aboriginal affairs in Australia, recommended the BARA scheme, the business advice in rural areas scheme, to Aboriginal Australians to help them start up small businesses so they would not be unemployed. And this is a minister of a government which axed it in the budget and closed it down. Then, when the minister went on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meet the Press</EMPHASIS> last night and had that very proposition put to him by Paul Bongiorno&mdash;you suggested last Friday, Minister, that Aboriginal people should access the BARA scheme, but you have closed it down&mdash;he said, `Yes, but I am going to talk to ATSIC about some interim funding for it. It was a decision the ATSIC board made to close it down.' This is straight off the top of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the head. This is a minister who, on every single day that passes here in the Senate, demonstrates that he knows nothing whatever about his portfolio; in fact, he is indicating not even the slightest interest in learning anything.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For three days this nonsense has been perpetuated. The BARA scheme in fact is administered by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. It was not a decision of the ATSIC board&mdash;how could it have been?&mdash;to close it down. It was a decision of that portfolio and its minister to close it down. To suggest, as the minister did last night, that ATSIC would divert funding into the Department of Primary Industries and Energy to keep a program going that they have lost is utter nonsense!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You closed the BARA scheme down. You closed down the expansion of the ABC into rural Australia, and you closed down the entire department of regional development. And what did your minister say? He made the most astonishing statement out of Canberra that I, coming from regional Australia, have seen in 20 years in this business. He said there is `no rationale or constitutional basis for the Commonwealth's involvement in regional development in Australia'. That is in his press statement.

I know it is in the towns, but in between the towns it is non&hyphen;existent and they had had that service since 1936. That service used to extend right out to sea, halfway across and beyond the Northern Territory from Western Australia, and the ships used to use it as well.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">Statement of reasons for introduction and passage in 1996 Spring Sittings</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">Wool International Amendment Bill</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Wool International Act 1993 to provide for changes to the fixed schedule for disposal of stockpile wool by Wool International.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reasons for Urgency</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments provide for implementation of changes to the fixed disposal schedule for stockpile wool from 1 January 1997 as recommended by the August Wool Roundtable, chaired by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, and with all sectors of the wool industry joining a consensus in favour of the proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Effect if the Bill is not passed this sitting</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decision on the changes to the fixed schedule has been taken after extensive consultation with the wool industry both domestically and internationally. If the changes are not implemented by 1 January 1997, the industry, and woolgrowers in particular, will potentially face a more depressed market due to greater quantities of stockpile wool having to be sold by Wool International in compliance with the current legislative requirements. Because of both the industry consultation process and the Roundtable consensus being public, a failure to implement the changes on time is likely to prompt strong negative reactions, particularly from growers, but also from the majority of Australia's overseas customers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Why the amendments were not foreseen</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments to the fixed schedule were initially expected to be implemented from 1 July 1997. This was the date by which Wool International had been intended to be privatised. Wool International is not now expected to be privatised but rather is to continue to manage the disposal of the stockpile.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The August Wool Roundtable recommended to the Government that the fixed disposal schedule be changed at the earliest possible date. As part of a negotiated package with a minority of processors who wanted a later implementation, a phased introduction of the changes was agreed by consensus to apply from 1 January 1997.</PARA>

<PARA>I seek leave to incorporate my tabling statement in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  and to continue my remarks later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The document read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Only some fourteen months after its commencement,  the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Native Title Act 1993</EMPHASIS>   stood in need of significant amendment as a consequence of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Brandy's</EMPHASIS>  case. Like the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, the National Native Title Tribunal under the Act purported to exercise the powers of a court; the High Court held that this was contrary to Chapter III of the Constitution and invalid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Brandy</EMPHASIS>  problem and some miscellaneous matters were the subject of the Keating Government's Native Title Amendment Bill 1995. The lapse of that bill with the dissolution of the House of Representatives in January this year meant that the problems with which it dealt remained to be addressed by the incoming Coalition Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By the time the Howard Government assumed office, the Native Title Act had been in operation for more than two years. In that period it became clear that there were many more problems confronting the Act than those presented by <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Brandy's</EMPHASIS>  case. First, numerous native title claims were either ambit in nature, competing with other claims to the same `country', or were clearly unsubstantiated. Nevertheless, virtually all claims were registered by the Tribunal following the decision by O'Loughlin J. in August 1995; this provided that virtually all claims gained the `right to negotiate' but gave rise to complaint by Indigenous and other interests alike. Second, the `future act' process was unmanageable, in particular for those States with the most <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5415"> mining activity: the Tribunal, the State Government and Indigenous interests have struggled to handle the volume of future act notices&mdash;for Indigenous interests, in many instances their resources were unable to cope with the volume of notices necessitating that they were unable to address many future act proposals and exercise their `right to negotiate'. Third, the process of mediation to resolve native title claims was not working; no determinations of native title had been made under the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition Government discussed these problems in the first Outline document of May 1996 <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Towards a More Workable Native Title Act</EMPHASIS> . This was followed by the tabling of the Native Title Amendment Bill 1996 on 27 June, the release on 8 October of the second Outline document, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Outline of Proposed Amendments to the Native Title Amendment Bill 1996</EMPHASIS> , and the tabling of the further Exposure Draft amendments on 17 October. Both the amendment bill and the Exposure Draft were referred for inquiry and report to the committee that I chair, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to inquire into these matters the Committee conducted fourteen days of public hearings across Australia and received numerous submissions. While many submissions criticised the Government's approach to amending the legislation, there was widespread agreement about the problems caused by various provisions of the Act. The Committee has carefully considered all of this material and it is taken into account in the report that I table today.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment bill, like the Keating Government's Native Title Amendment Bill 1995, contains proposals to overcome problems emanating from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Brandy</EMPHASIS> . Native title claims would be filed in the Federal Court. There has been no criticism of this general approach which is endorsed by the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further, the Committee's report supports the overall position taken by the Government to make the Native Title Act more workable. A reasonable <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">registration test</EMPHASIS>  is proposed which would sift out those claims which are unsustainable or which would be confronted by significant obstacles were they to progress to mediation or were they to become part of `future act' negotiations. There is general acceptance of the need for a registration test from Indigenous interests and industry alike. Importantly, although unregistered claims would not qualify for the `right to negotiate' concerning development proposals, they would remain filed in the Federal Court and mediation could proceed so that the claims could be settled.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In regard to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">mediation</EMPHASIS> , that process has experienced difficulties that require attention. If mediation is to be preferred to the protracted adversarial context of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> courts, then it needs to produce results in an efficient and fair manner. While the Tribunal appears to have been operating as well as might be expected under the Act, the legislation is in need of amendment in the interests of all parties to native title claims. In reforming the Act to provide that native title is the focus of mediation and that mediation be pursued where there is prospect of success but not otherwise, the proposed amendments to the native title mediation process are overdue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another significant issue that the proposed amendments address is the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">`future act' regime</EMPHASIS> . Not only did the Committee hear evidence that this regime was a disincentive to development, but Indigenous people confirmed that it could be contrary to their interests as a result. The proposed amendments will allow the legitimate interests of native title holders to be protected yet minimise unnecessary delays in the negotiating process. The Committee heard evidence that it was highly desirable for the future act process to contain triggers that progressed the matter. This is achieved under the amendment proposals whereby:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">development activity with minimal impact (such as exploring/ prospecting/fossicking) could proceed directly by Ministerial determination (s.26A);</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">time limits on negotiation and arbitration would be shortened from six to four months after the issue of a future act notice (s.35); and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">subject to conditions, the Minister could intervene in the negotiation process and make a determination that the development can or cannot proceed (s.34A).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Importantly, these proposals preserve for native title holders the `right to negotiate' in regard to overall development projects in normal circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's amendment proposals contained in the Exposure Draft of 8 October cover an additional two matters&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">indigenous land use agreements</EMPHASIS>  (ILUA) and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">representative bodies</EMPHASIS> . The Committee believes that ILUAs require acknowledgment and registration for the benefit of all parties; the amendment proposals are accordingly endorsed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similarly, there has been a clear need for representative bodies to be subject to a statutory regime to ensure that the needs of native title holders are met. The Committee has found that, in general, the proposed regime is desirable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In summary, then, the Committee report accepts the proposed amendments in regard to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Brandy</EMPHASIS> , registration of claims, mediation, the `future act' regime and, in general, the statutory scheme for representative bodies. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5416"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This does not mean, however, that the Committee has endorsed the Native Title Amendment Bill 1996 and the Exposure Draft amendments in their entirety. The Committee does not believe it desirable to consider the proposed amendment (Item 112) that would permit a pastoral lease renewal where the new lease granted more extensive interests including a perpetual term until the High Court's imminent decision in the Wik matter is handed down. The decision may well obviate the need for this amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further, the Committee considers that, where a native title applicant has been denied assistance by a representative body, ATSIC should not be involved in conducting a review of the representative body's original decision (so that the Minister may determine the matter). It needs to be ensured that the confidence of native title claimants is maintained in the appeal process. For this reason the proposed amendment at Item 114ZE is recommended to be itself amended.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Moreover, three other amendments are recommended as a result of the Committee's deliberations. They are:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">that a native title application should be registered if it is `reasonably arguable' and that reference to `prima facie'' examination should be deleted;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">that reference to judges should be removed from the required qualifications for appointment as President of the National Native Title Tribunal; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">that persons conducting consultancies in native title are not eligible for appointment as Tribunal members, or must cease such activity upon appointment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This report that I table today is the sixth prepared by the Committee; to this point the Committee has been able to arrive at consensus positions and unanimous reports. Although the Chair's draft of this report was prepared with that same objective, it has drawn a minority report from non&hyphen;Government members. That is a matter for genuine regret to me as Chair. (The Senate should note that Senator Reynolds has not been able to sign the minority report today, but I am assured that she wishes to subscribe to it.)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee cooperated well at public hearings and attendance was conscientious in the main. Accordingly, it is disappointing that there was no attempt by the minority to discuss their report with the full committee. The Democrat  member, who is a signatory to the minority report, did not attend any of the public hearings held outside Canberra and did not participate in any committee deliberations concerning the report. For the committee system to operate effectively, there needs to be genuine involvement and cooperation. Regretably, this did not occur. This does not keep faith with <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> those who are anxious to see the Native Title Act finally deliver benefits to Indigenous people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the advantages enjoyed by minority reports, in particular that a clear target is presented by the majority view, I should outline the most significant fallacies contained in the dissent to the Committee's report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">First</EMPHASIS> , the minority report claims to give `primacy' to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Racial Discrimination Act 1975</EMPHASIS>  (RDA). This is a somewhat convenient approach for non&hyphen;Government members to take. They did not take it in 1993 when the Native Title Act was being developed and passed through the Parliament. May I remind the Senate that, pursuant to ss.14 and 19 of the Native Title Act, native title was actually extinguished on a limited number of leases. This legislative action was contrary to the RDA but is valid as a later and specific act. What has provoked the present concern for the `primacy' of the RDA when that did not prevail only three years ago?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further, however, it is the majority view that the amendments currently proposed would not offend the RDA. In evidence to the Committee the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department confirmed that the `right to negotiate' under the Native Title Act is a `special measure' pursuant to s.8 of the RDA. As such it is a right not enjoyed by other Australians and may be affected by legislation without overriding the RDA. And, as I have already explained, the proposed amendment permitting pastoral lease renewals on more favourable grounds, which the Social Justice Commissioner has suggested would override the RDA, is the subject of a recommendation by the Committee that it not be considered by the Parliament until the High Court has delivered judgement in the Wik matter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Moreover, the minority report's approach to the RDA is, in principle, bad law. To purport to make all provisions amending the Native Title Act subject to the RDA is to create a further wide range of legal uncertainties. Finally, the minority report has overlooked the fact that the Native Title Act already makes an early reference to the RDA in s.7:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> 7(1) Nothing in this Act affects the operation of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Racial Discrimination Act  1975</EMPHASIS> .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> (2) Subsection (1) does not affect the validation of past acts by or in accordance with this Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In summary, the approach of the minority report to give `primacy' to the RDA is, in addition to being grossly hypocritical, addressing a problem which has not been shown to exist, is bad law, and is unnecessary. It is a sentiment that is superficially attractive, but will not bear any kind of analysis. The Prime Minister's assurance that the Government would respect the principles of the RDA <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5417"> remains uncontradicted by the amendment proposals that the Committee has endorsed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Second</EMPHASIS> , the minority report is critical of the proposed registration test for native title applications. It should be borne in mind that the registration test is not the doorway to mediation for claims; under the proposed amendments claims would be filed in the Federal Court and could proceed to mediation whether registered or not. Rather, registration is the threshold test for access to the `right to negotiate' regime for `future acts'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not all applications should have access to the `right to negotiate'. Indigenous leaders have confirmed that some native title claims are ambit claims and vexatious. For such claims to be excluded from the `right to negotiate' regime a reasonable test is required. The Government has proposed such a test in seven parts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The minority report makes the mistake of arguing that the withdrawal or restriction of the `right to negotiate' may breach the RDA. This assertion is unsustainable on several grounds:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">it has not been shown that the `right to negotiate' is a right subject to the RDA;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the `right to negotiate' is a `special measure' which may be modified without offending the RDA; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the `right to negotiate' cannot in any case be shown properly to apply to all claims (although that has virtually been the case as a practical fact since the decision of O'Loughlin J. in August 1995).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the threshold regime for access to the `right to negotiate' is a matter requiring judgement as to what is fair and workable, the minority report avoids serious consideration of the extent of difficulties for project development where unsubstantiated claims are involved. The majority does not seek to avoid the fact that the test is demanding; were it not so, the present circumstance where unjustifiable claims seriously hinder the `future act' process would remain. It should be remembered in this context that project developments provide real and genuine economic benefits to the local Indigenous communities. To delay projects or frustrate them from commencing is to deny Indigenous people the opportunity to share in the wealth created by such projects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Third</EMPHASIS> , and in regard to mediation, the minority report is critical of the fact that the proposed s.86A concentrates mediation on native title. In the view of the minority, mediation should seek to reconcile the interests of the parties rather than concentrate on their perceived rights.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a most questionable proposal. The National Native Title Tribunal was established in part to facilitate mediation pursuant to Part 3 of the Act; <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and the Act has as its first object the recognition and protection of native title. Where mediation ranges too far beyond the question of native title the process exceeds its proper purpose. Further, applications waiting for mediation are disadvantaged by time consuming mediation of other claims not directed towards native title. This is a most undesirable outcome from the perspective of applicants who are exercising their rights under the Act to participate in mediation <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">about native title</EMPHASIS> .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fourth</EMPHASIS> , the minority report criticises various `future act' amendment proposals: they include the possible exclusion of exploration from the `right to negotiate', a `once only right to negotiate', a reduction in the `right to negotiate' negotiation period and ministerial intervention in the right to negotiate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Again, these are all matters where judgement must be exercised: the fairness of the process for native title applicants must be balanced against the rights of other Australians to the development of enterprises; the national good must also be kept in perspective. Provided that the interests of native title claimants are preserved in this process, a flexible regime that facilitates development is to be endorsed. The Government appears to have formulated amendment proposals complying with this objective that will address the current significant difficulties. The provision for indigenous land use agreements to be registered will assist this process considerably.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The presentation of the minority report and its contents indicate that the proposed amendments to the Native Title Act will be a major issue for the Senate early in the Autumn sittings. This, together with the fact that submissions are still being provided, necessitates that the matter should continue before the Native Title Committee for another month and for further report. The majority report makes this recommendation, which I will be moving in this chamber shortly. I commend that recommendation and this report to the</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The document read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over recent years there has been an increasing move to manage global interactions such as migratory fish species through the treaty making process. This process may involve bilateral negotiations between nations on issues specific to those parties, or the negotiation of multilateral treaties with either a regional or global focus.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Two such agreements relating to the management of the tuna fisheries are the Subsidiary Agreement Between the Government of Australia and the Government of Japan Concerning the Long&hyphen;line Tuna Fishing 1996 and the Agreement for the Establishment of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties conducted public inquiries into these agreements in its role of providing detailed scrutiny of those treaties which are of particular interest to Australians. This public inquiry process provided the opportunity for individuals and groups with concerns about the potential adverse impact of these treaties or the adequacy of the consultation processes, to make their concerns known.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There were 45 submissions and 18 supplementary submissions to the inquiry into the subsidiary agreements and nine submissions to the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission inquiry. The Committee held 8 public hearings in Canberra, Hobart, Perth, Port Lincoln and Adelaide.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This report looks at the agreements together as they raise a number of substantial issues in relation to the management of tuna stocks. These include the sustainability of tuna stocks, the large take of tuna species within the Australian Fishing Zone which could be utilised by the domestic long&hyphen;line industry, the importance of port access to port communities, bycatch of fish important to the recreational and game fishing industry and the bycatch of seabirds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Japanese fishing vessels have for some time, utilised the fish resources in Australian waters that have not been exploited by the Australian fleet. Now, however, the Australian fishing industry has become increasingly dependent on migratory species</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Today's tabling is the culmination of several months of public hearings and inspections in Canberra, Hobart, Perth, Adelaide and Port Lincoln. It has been a complicated task in respect of what appears on the surface to be a fairly simple bilateral fishery agreement with Japan. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1979 a bilateral Agreement on Fisheries between the government of Australia and the government of Japan, Head Agreement, was signed to facilitate close cooperation in the conservation and optimum utilisation of the living resources within Australia's Exclusive Economic Zone, EEZ.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under this Agreement, annual subsidiary agreements permit Japanese long&hyphen;line vessels to catch about 7 000 tonnes of fish within the EEZ. The Japanese vessels target a number of tuna species including yellowfin, bigeye and southern bluefin tuna.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The subsidiary agreements restrict the operations of the Japanese fleet in terms of effort and/or catch levels in some areas. The Committee is concerned that there is the potential to circumvent these restrictions by changing to joint venture arrangements or through foreign ownership of fishing licences, SBT.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Concerns over the depletion in the southern bluefin tuna, SBT, stock resulted in the establishment of the Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia, New Zealand and Japan are parties to this Convention which ensures through appropriate management, the conservation and optimum utilisation of SBT. The Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna meets annually to determine the global total allowable catch and national quota allocations for the SBT fishery.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The delays in setting recent quotas resulted from differences in opinion as to whether SBT stocks are recovering. Australia and New Zealand have opposed increasing the quotas, preferring the precautionary approach to managing stocks as required by the United Nations Agreement on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks. Japan, however, has excess capacity in its fishing fleet which could be utilised to catch additional SBT quotas. The Committee supports with the continuation of the cautious approach as the consequence of getting the quotas wrong will be evident for several decades.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Last year the Commission determined that the total allowable global catch of SBT was 11 750 tonnes. Since the introduction of national quotas Australia, New Zealand and Japan have been required to reduce their annual catch. However, when the Japanese quota was decreased, the catches of other nations then increased through reflagging or by way of Japanese/Korean company interactions. It had been was estimated that the catch by Korea, Indonesia and Taiwan which are not party to the Convention, was of the order of 3 200 tonnes in total this year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee believes that the capacity to manage tuna stocks could be enhanced by the introduction of a certificate system which requires <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5419"> that all fish entering the market be identified to prevent fish caught by non&hyphen;parties to the Commission being accepted in the market. When the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna introduced the certificate system, this resulted in a number of other countries joining the Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee appreciates that there are significant difficulties in introducing a certificate system but believes that such a system could significantly improve the management capacity significantly for the conservation of migratory species such as tunas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The subsidiary agreements provide Japanese fishing vessels with access to Australian ports as well as fishing rights within the Australian Fishing Zone. This is linked to the Commission in that it is Australia's policy that the subsidiary agreements cannot be finalised until the SBT quotas are set.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends the separation of port access and the subsidiary agreements as this arrangement is not commercially satisfactory from a business perspective. A significant number of industries in Australia are dependent on Japanese companies and Japanese marketing. Although the Committee appreciates that an open port access policy is unacceptable, it believes that the Commonwealth government should investigate other mechanisms for linking port access with Australia's fisheries resource management objectives. The Committee has suggested linking this with Japan's participation in the Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna, CCSBT.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under this Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna other countries cannot have access to Australian ports to facilitate their fishing activities. While this could be used to encourage countries such as Korea and Indonesia to join the Convention, the wider implications of this in terms of potential additional fishing pressures adjacent to and within the AFZ will need to be addressed by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is imperative that Australia does not assist the capacity of other nations to fish in a manner which is detrimental to the long term sustainability of some species. Japan has already cooperated in implementing a number of environmental measures requested by the Australian government and it would not be in the Australian fishing industry's long term interest to assist countries that have not given the same undertakings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are substantial mutual benefits to Australia and Japan in the subsidiary agreements. The subsidiary agreements provide the framework within which difficult issues in relation to fisheries can be contained and managed without impacting adversely on the broader bilateral relationship.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is also considerable cooperation between Australian and Japanese fishermen who and they <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have taught the Australians the art of long&hyphen;lining. Co&hyphen;operation has extended to joint ventures, assistance in the establishment of the tuna farm experiment, joint financing of external scientists, joint efforts in addressing the seabird by catch problem and reducing the catch of small tuna.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian fishermen also derive considerable benefit from the presence of Japanese vessels fishing in Australian waters because of the data provided on location and catch. SBT. Further, Australia does not have the capacity, or the SBT quotas, to fish the entire stock in the AFZ. Southern bluefin tuna is a global fishery with market and access important part of international cooperation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the Committee is not convinced that the subsidiary agreements need to be renewed on an annual basis. There are a number of benefits outlined in this report that would support a biennial or even a five year agreement. To prevent the urgency provisions for tabling treaties from being invoked each year, the Committee recommends that the agreements run for at least two years. The Committee also believes that the current process may need to be revised to ensure that the delays experienced in signing last year's agreement do not become an annual event.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Strong Everyone submitting evidence to the inquiry supported the concept of the subsidiary agreement, with, a number of submissions and witnesses requesting amendments or a gradual phasing out of Japanese access with progressive to facilitate Australianisation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of witnesses requested additional fishing exclusion zones to facilitate the local industry to development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee supports this principle and believes that these changes should be implemented where Australian fishermen can demonstrate they have the capacity to utilise the resources in that area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In particular, the Committee now supports the extension of the exclusion zone around Tasmania to 50 nautical miles. While the Committee accepts that the Tasmanian fishing fleet may not have the capacity yet to fully utilise the tuna stocks in that region, the Australian fishing fleet does have that capacity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is also concerned that a number of prime pelagic species are not included in subsidiary agreements. In some cases there is inadequate knowledge on the sustainability of tuna, billfish and swordfish species. The Committee commends the research already in progress and supports a cautious approach in managing these stocks.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to environmental measures, the Committee heard a number of concerns in relation to the bycatch of sharks, marlin and swordfish in SBT long&hyphen;ling operations. There are also a number of issues in relation to administrative and legislative <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5420"> aspects of implementing conservation measures that need to be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of particular concern was the bycatch of seabirds about which the Committee has made a number of recommendations. The honourable Member for Dickson will deal with this in more detail.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee received a number of submissions from the recreational and game fishing sector requesting the release of all marlin bycatch by long&hyphen;line vessels which the Committee supports. Further work is needed into the relative economic values of these two sectors in some areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee was provided with a number of conflicting views on the benefits and disadvantages of the bilateral arrangements. The Committee believes that a full cost benefit analysis should be undertaken to determine the true benefit of these agreements to both countries. A number of issues may be resolved if this information was available.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second Agreement to be considered in this report is the Agreement for the Establishment of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission, IOTC. The formation of this Commission continues the trend to form international management regimes for highly migratory tuna species in light of their vulnerability to fishing on the high seas. The IOTC will act as a regional fisheries management organisation for major international tuna fisheries for yellowfin, skipjack, bigeye, albacore and SBT. Membership is available to Indian Ocean rim countries and countries that fish in the Indian Ocean.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While Australia will request that the IOTC recognise the competence of the CCSBT there will be continuing pressure for the IOTC to play a role in the management of activities which will impact on SBT and other tuna stocks. Further, countries which do not currently belong to the CCSBT but have significant SBT catches, may become members of the IOTC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee believes that Australia should become a party to the IOTC and that an Instrument of Acceptance be deposited on or before 2 December 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also notes Western Australia's particular interest in the activities of the IOTC. It believes there is the capacity to have greater participation by the states and Territories in the treaty process where the issues involved will significantly impact on the economy of those states. The Committee therefore recommends that representatives from Western Australia be given the opportunity to participate in the delegation to, and consultations relevant to, the activities of the IOTC.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The document read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In June of this year, the Committee was asked by the Parliamentary Secretary Assisting the Treasurer to examine the Draft Second Corporate Law Simplification Bill. This Bill, which has not yet been introduced into Parliament, represents the second stage of the ongoing Corporations Law Simplification Program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In general terms, the Bill seeks to simplify and improve those provisions of the Corporations Law which deal with the formation of companies, company meetings, share capital, financial statements, annual returns, the deregistration of defunct companies and company names.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee notes with approval that the Bill has already been refined through a process of extensive consultation between the Simplification Task Force and those affected by the Bill. The Committee's comments on the Bill are made as part of that process of refinement through consultation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Submissions and oral evidence during the inquiry showed that, almost without exception, there was strong support for the Bill. The many matters of detail and drafting issues that were raised during the inquiry have been made available to the Task Force. The Committee urges that these matters be considered prior to the Bill's introduction into Parliament later this year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of more fundamental issues were also raised with the Committee, and our Report discusses these in more depth. In discussing them, our Report applies some basic principles. One of these is that companies now operate in an international marketplace. Recognising this means that we need to move to international best practice in disclosure <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> by companies. To achieve this, the Committee recommends, among other things:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">that the Corporations Law should require that information disclosed by Australian listed companies in overseas jurisdictions be promptly and prominently announced via the Australian Stock Exchange to Australian investors;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">that the proposal in the Bill for including in company annual reports a general management discussion in narrative form should be retained;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">that a number of additional specific matters should be included in the annual reports of listed companies&mdash;these include Board policies for determining the remuneration (including incentives) of the Board and senior executives and the relationship of these policies to the performance of the company; details of the remuneration, age and other directorships of the directors; and general details of litigation instituted against, or concluded by, the company; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">that the Corporations Law should require the auditors of listed companies (or their representatives) to be available to take questions at the annual general meeting at which the auditor's report is tabled. In return, the Bill should make clear that answers by auditors to questions at an AGM attract qualified privilege in the same way as other activities by auditors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conducting business in an international marketplace also means recognising the particular problems faced by investors, both local and international. The Committee was told that some investors have difficulty in ensuring that their proxy votes are lodged within the time available. Others have difficulty in ensuring that their voting intentions are adequately expressed. Still others have difficulty in ensuring that their proxy votes are actually voted when appropriate. Therefore the Committee recommends:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">that, as a general rule, the minimum notice period for a members' meeting of a listed company should be 28 days;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">that a standardised proxy form should be developed to enable all shareholders to express the full range of their voting intentions; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">that the chairman at an AGM should be required to call for a poll if so instructed by a required number of the proxies held by him or her, or if the vote on a show of hands does not reflect the votes of the proxies held by him or her.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of course, corporations don't only operate in an international marketplace, they operate in an increasingly electronic one. To some extent, the Draft Bill recognises this. However, the Committee felt that it could go further&mdash;for example, enabling companies to send notices and other information to members electronically and enabling members to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5422"> send proxies to companies electronically. While there should be no obligation to use electronic forms of communication, the Committee believes that the Bill should nevertheless facilitate their use. It should also clarify some of the effects of technological failure. Therefore the Committee recommends:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">that the Bill should more extensively recognise electronic forms of communication between companies and their members, and regulatory authorities; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">that the Corporations Law should make clear that, where it is proposed to hold a meeting using technological assistance, the participants at the meeting should be aware of the intended use of that technology, of the effect on the meeting of any failure of that technology and (for directors' meetings) of the effect on the meeting of any withdrawal of consent to the continued use of that technology.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill provides for members' meetings to be called in a number of circumstances. It provides that a director may call such a meeting, but declares this to be a replaceable rule&mdash;this means that it may be displaced by a company's constitution. There is a demonstrable need for directors, particularly of listed companies, to be able to act independently in the interests of the company and all its shareholders. Therefore the Committee recommends that a director's right to call a members' meeting ought to be a mandatory rule for listed companies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Members' meetings may be called in other circumstances. For example, a proportion of the members may require the directors to call a meeting. If the directors fail to call such a meeting and the members convene it themselves, the directors as a whole must reimburse the company for the costs of the meeting. The Committee believes that, as a matter of fairness, only those directors in default should be liable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also gives the members a right to convene a meeting themselves without first approaching the directors. Some concerns were expressed that this right might be used frivolously, or to pass resolutions that were not within the powers of members. To avoid this happening, the Committee recommends that the Bill should make clear that the power of members to convene a meeting should not be exercised frivolously and should be exercised only where the purpose of the meeting is a valid purpose for such a meeting.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill does not address the issue of meetings of members where a company has different classes of shareholders. The Committee recommends that the Bill give consideration to enabling the members of a class of shareholders to call a meeting of that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> class to consider matters able to be dealt with at such a meeting.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, I would like to refer to two specific matters of concern that arose during the inquiry&mdash;one to do with the proposed abolition of the par value of shares and the other to do with the application of the small/large test for proprietary companies&mdash;something that arose out of the First Simplification Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the Committee generally supports the move to abolish par value, such a move brings with it transitional consequences and taxation consequences. Abolishing par value means that the Stock Exchange will have to revise its listing rules and many companies may have to reconsider their constitutions and classes of shares. Many of the taxation consequences&mdash;particularly for future bonus issues of shares, or on the conversion of convertible preference shares&mdash;are not yet clear. What is clear is that considerable care is needed in this area. Therefore, the Committee recommends that the adequacy of the transitional period for, and the possible taxation consequences of, the abolition of par value and the share premium account should be carefully considered by the Government. The Committee notes an opportunity to further examine this issue when the Bill is finally introduced into Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also notes the impending promulgation of an ASC Draft Class Order governing the granting of audit relief to some large proprietary companies. Some of the additional criteria which the ASC proposes to include in this Class Order may have the effect of disadvantaging certain large proprietary companies, particularly franchised motor dealers. The Committee intends discussing the matter with the ASC in the near future. Subject to these discussions, it may further review the effect and operation of the small/large test in early 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the interim, the Committee recommends that the ASC reconsider the criteria to be included in its Draft Class Order to remove any unnecessary audit burden from franchised motor dealers or businesses in similar circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I offer my thanks to my House of Representatives and Senate colleagues who make up this key Committee, for their co&hyphen;operation and contribution to the deliberations of the Committee, its findings and recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My special thanks also to the Committee staff who have worked tirelessly on this Inquiry. Derek Abbott was initially Secretary and got the new Committee up and running and this Inquiry underway. James Warmenhoven took over as Secretary part&hyphen;way through the Inquiry and demonstrated his ability and commitment by quickly getting up to speed and effectively contributing to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5423"> the work of the Committee.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the bill is to prevent the Commonwealth Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 (the act) from further impeding the building of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge. The bill achieves this by providing that the provisions of the act do not authorise the minister to make a declaration over the area which will be used to build the bridge.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will not affect the operations of the act in relation to any applications for protection made by members of the local indigenous community in respect of sites of significance elsewhere on Hindmarsh Island, or by the indigenous people elsewhere in Australia. The bill is designed to remove the hiatus caused by the circumstances following the making of the previous and current applications by Ngarrindjeri women for protection of sites on Hindmarsh Island.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senators will be aware of the protracted nature of this matter which arose from a number of applications for protection made in December 1993, April and May 1994, culminating in the former minister in the Labor government making an emergency declaration under section 9 of the act in July 1994. While in force for 30 days which is the period allowable under s 9 of the act, the minister used his authority to extend the emergency declaration by a further 30 days enabling the preparation of a report to the minister by Professor Cheryl Saunders. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The consideration of the report and its attachments by the former minister and his decision to make a declaration for protection for a period of 25 years, as senators will know, became the subject of legal action in the Federal Court in July 1994. The Court's decision is well known to all senators. The former minister's appeal against the Court's order to quash his decision of 9 July failed&mdash;the Full Court of the High Court rightly found on 7 December 1995 that he had failed to follow the due process of the act for which he was responsible by not personally considering a representation attached to the Saunders report and known generally as the "secret women's business". The declaration to prevent the building of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge was consequently ruled to be ineffective and had no force.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the meantime, a South Australian Royal Commission found that the so called "secret women's business" was a total fabrication. This finding was supported by the view of some of the Ngarrindjeri women (the so&hyphen;called "dissident women") who maintained that there was no secret women's business associated with Hindmarsh Island.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is unfortunate that the government of the day did not then decide to cut its losses and allow the bridge to be built.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The former government appointed then Minister Crowley to deal with a further application by the Ngarrindjeri women received in December 1995, on the basis that Senator Crowley would be in a position to consider any " secret women's business" tendered in the reporting process. Senator Crowley ruled that the December 1995 application was a valid application under the act. Once a valid application is received, under current law, a report must be prepared. Justice Mathews was commissioned by Senator Crowley to prepare a section 10 report which was completed at a cost of over $1m.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As senators will know, Justice Mathews' appointment has since been deemed invalid by the High Court. Although Justice Mathews' report&mdash;which was tabled in the Senate on 17 September 1996, found that "there is insufficient material from which the minister could be satisfied that the building of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge would desecrate this area according to these traditions", it cannot be used for the purposes of deciding the application for protection. Ultimately the former government's decision to appoint Justice Mathews to prepare a report has not resulted in any advance to the matters which were raised in the original application of December 1993. Three years and several million dollars later, neither the proponents of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge nor the original applicants have come away with a final decision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This government has not lightly made the decision to prepare special legislation to enable the Hindmarsh Island Bridge to be built. It has sought <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5424"> advice and considered the options open to it. The advice of the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department is that yet another report must be prepared on the Hindmarsh Island Bridge application, or the current law must be changed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The minister has considered appointing another reporter (under the provisions of the act). While this appears to be the process least likely to cause concern, the recent history of the administration of the act, highlighted by litigation in respect of applications for protection in Broome and Perth, reveals that, even if all the "i's" were dotted, and "t's" crossed, there would be no guarantee of a satisfactory outcome, and potentially further substantive costs to the taxpayer. Moreover, it is unlikely that a newly appointed reporter would receive any information that was not available to Justice Mathews in the preparation of her report. The government therefore believes that the act as it stands has proved to be unworkable in this instance, and there is no guarantee that a further reporting process would finally settle the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decision to prepare separate special legislation to overcome the current situation is seen by the government as being the most practical course to resolve the issue once and for all.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It may be argued that the government has decided that cost outweighs concern for Aboriginal heritage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is not the case. The costs associated with the heritage protection process in this case have been extremely high, higher than for all other applications which have been determined through the processes of section 10 reports. Given the uncertainty of the outcome of another report, and the potential further drain on funds which could be applied to more beneficial programs, the government has judged that enough is enough.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before concluding, I remind senators of the former Labor government's decision to review the act. That decision is one which this government has endorsed. Ms Elizabeth Evatt AC, who was appointed to review the operations of the act has now provided the minister with a report which was tabled in Parliament on 26 September 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the general recommendations in the report which suggest that an overhaul of the legislation is overdue, the government has placed a high priority on addressing the findings of the report. It is pertinent to comment that, in her report, Ms Evatt has suggested that "The recommendations would help to overcome many of the current frustrations and could contribute in a positive way to the goals of Aboriginal reconciliation."</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill amends the Health Insurance Act 1973 to give effect to the main Budget measures relating to Medicare benefits. Most of the bill relates to the eligibility requirements for medical practitioners whose services are covered by Medicare. Other clauses in Schedule 2 of the bill modify the level of benefit payable for some services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The changes to provider eligibility build on the vocational registration requirements in Section 3F of the act which were introduced by the former Government in 1989. Vocational registration, introduced the concept of general practice as a separate discipline which required specific post graduate training for unsupervised practice and provided higher fees for patients of vocationally registered general practitioners.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under this bill, new doctors will be required to have or be in the process of obtaining a recognised post graduate medical qualification before their patients are able to attract Medicare benefits at all.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This measure is vitally important for several reasons. First, it will increase the quality of health care available to the Australian community by making sure that, in future, all general practitioners have been properly trained. It recognises the current reality that a basic medical degree is no longer adequate for a doctor to practice unsupervised in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, it will help correct some of the distribution problems with the medical workforce, where <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5425"> we have the absurd situation of having to import more that 500 overseas trained doctors on temporary visas each year to work in our public hospital system, even though we have something like 4000 more doctors than our population would require.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, it will reduce one of the major growth pressures on Medicare, making it more sustainable in the longer term. There is widespread agreement that the increasing number of medical practitioners is one of the main growth pressures on the health costs in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new requirements will apply to new doctors who register with State and Territory medical boards on or after 1 November 1996. This includes those new medical practitioners who are currently undertaking their internship year.  The new requirements also apply to a group of doctors who although medically registered in Australia are neither Australian citizens nor residents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other than these two groups, no existing medical practitioners will be affected by these changes. Even those registered medical practitioners who do not currently have a Medicare provider number will still be able to obtain full access to Medicare at any time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the new measures, all overseas trained doctors who wish to work in Australia, with access to Medicare will also have to meet the new requirements. However, because the distortions of the medical workforce mean that our health system has a reliance on temporary visa doctors, the new postgraduate requirements will not be mandatory for doctors coming into Australia on a temporary residence basis until 1 November 1997.  This will give public hospitals and others who rely on temporary resident doctors a chance to make other arrangements. Nevertheless it is my intention to look very carefully at the circumstances in which temporary residence doctors are allowed to come into Australia in the longer term. I will be making sure that overseas doctors are not taking jobs which could be filled by Australian citizens or permanent residents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Furthermore, the Medicare access provided to new trainees will, in future be limited to their actual training posts. This move will make sure that doctors in training are not moonlighting in jobs for which they are not trained and not taking jobs from fully trained general practitioners by working at a lower rate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian medical schools produce undifferentiated medical graduates&mdash;graduates who have completed basic training but who have not yet acquired the specific knowledge or skills necessary to work effectively in an unsupervised capacity in any specific area of medical practice. Most medical practitioners currently go on to complete some form of postgraduate training in a chosen specialty. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, up until now a minority of graduates fresh from medical school, and with only one year's practical experience as an intern have been able to set up their own private practice, treating patients for conditions which may rarely be seen in a hospital context. Graduates proceeding in this way bypass the vocational training expected for general practice. This kind of career path can have adverse results in terms of both the cost and the quality of services provided.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under vocational registration, introduced by the previous Government, fees for these doctors are significantly lower than those for recognised general practitioners, but this has not stopped these doctors from entering this type of practice. In fact, there are concerns that some of these doctors might even be increasing their throughput to make up for the lower fees. This Government is doing the responsible thing by making sure that these doctors stay in the supervised hospital system until they are properly trained to work unsupervised in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In fact, these doctors are needed in our hospitals, where there are constant shortages. We hear stories of doctors in hospitals working 160 hour fortnights and doing 24 hour shifts. Clearly there are issues of quality that need to be addressed here. When you ask the states and territories why they don't employ more doctors they say they are unable to attract doctors into the hospitals because graduates can make more money through Medicare. In turn, States recruit doctors from overseas who, equally, may lack appropriate training and certainly do not have the particular experience required to work in some of our rural hospitals and outback communities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whilst we acknowledge the valuable work that these doctors are doing in our hospitals and rural communities it has to be recognised that bringing in doctors from overseas when there are plenty of Australian graduates who, with training, could find meaningful work in these areas, doesn't make sense.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill will not only ensure that in future new doctors are undertaking vocational training before being allowed full access to Medicare, but at the same time will deal with one of the main distortions in the medical workforce.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other amendments to the act will allow for the implementation of the multiple services rules for diagnostic imaging services and general medical services, a change to the greatest permissible gap to $50 and a change to the arrangements for services of unusual length or complexity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The addition of multiple services rules provide a power to make regulations to implement the rules. Such rules recognise that, when a diagnostic imaging service is rendered with another service to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5426"> a patient, there is an over-remuneration in fees for part of the costs of rendering the services. Existing sections of the act and regulations provide for multiple operations, anaesthetics and pathology rules. These rules have been in operation for many years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While it is not intended to introduce specific multiple services rules for general medical services at this time, the concept is being introduced to ensure uniformity across all service types.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The change to the greatest permissible gap, that is, the maximum gap between the Medicare Schedule fee listed for any out of hospital service and the Medicare benefit payable for that service, is being increased to $50. While the act gives the gap as $26.80, the amount is indexed annually and without this amendment would have been $30.20.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The final amendments remove the ability for changes to be sought to increase fees for services of unusual length or complexity. This is being done for two reasons:  Firstly, Medicare Schedule fees&mdash;and consequently Medicare benefits paid&mdash;should be based on the  swings and roundabouts' principle, with the fee regarded as being reasonable on average for the service having regard to usual and reasonable variations in the performance time on different occasions and to reasonable ranges of complexity and technical difficulty encountered. Secondly, such a change will prevent the creation of items attracting a higher fee without Ministerial approval or parliamentary scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measures we are introducing in this bill amount to fundamental restructuring of the health care system to target Medicare subsidies more effectively. They will assist in ensuring that Medicare is sustainable as a world class system of health care.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I  commend the bill to the Senate and present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am going to make three or four minutes of general comment, and then, as I have indicated on previous schedules, in order to facilitate the program, I am going to incorporate some seven or eight pages of specific comments. Schedule 7, termination of employment, proves once and for all that the government's pre-election hysteria about unfair dismissal laws was nothing but a giant beat-up. The hypocrisy of the government, which this schedule shows, is staggering.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most fundamental point about the government's amendments to our unfair dismissal laws is that the substance of the law&mdash;the substantive provisions which will be applied in determining whether a dismissal was unfair&mdash;is basically unchanged. Remember the hysteria about the so-called requirement for the employer to give the employee a warning before dismissal? Well, it is still there, Senator Campbell. Why?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Section 170CG will require the commission to consider whether there was a valid reason for the termination related to the conduct of the employee, whether the employee was notified of that reason and whether the employee was given an opportunity to respond to that reason. Not only that; the commission is required to consider whether the employee was warned&mdash;yes, the word `warned' is used&mdash;about any unsatisfactory performance <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> before the termination. I have no doubt there will be many lawyers advising employers that they must still give an employee a warning before dismissal if they are not to fall foul of these laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But do not get us wrong: we support these provisions. But the point is that it was this need for a warning that was the centrepiece for the then Liberal opposition's campaign of hysteria about the unfair dismissal laws. Yet it is still there, just as the substance of the unfair dismissal laws has basically been unchanged. And the government knows this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that the hysteria about unfair dismissal laws is no longer around, yet our laws continue in effect. Where are all the callers to talkback radio about absurd results under the unfair dismissal laws? Where are the employer groups' rantings&mdash;I use that word cautiously, but there was a lot of ranting on this issue&mdash;that terminations are being continually challenged under our unfair dismissal laws? Where are they? There are none, because in January 1996 we got the unfair dismissal laws basically right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No wonder the government are not really changing the substance of the law. They know there is no need to. No wonder the government refused to take up the Democrats' offer in May or June this year to immediately deal with the government's amendments to the unfair dismissal laws. What is the rush when you are not really doing anything, Senator Murray? I notice that you even smiled on this point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No wonder the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) in the other place refused to guarantee that under his unfair dismissal laws more jobs would be created in small business in the next three years than the half a million created during the last three years of the Labor government. How could he when he knows this law is not really that different?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth is now out, and nowhere has the truth been plainer than in the recent annual report of the Industrial Relations Court of Australia. In that report, the chief justice noted: </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5428">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the controversy about the unlawful termination provisions was fuelled by a degree of deliberate misrepresentation.</PARA>
<PARA>On concerns about an increasing filing rate of unlawful termination claims, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it became apparent during 1995-96 that the filing rate would not continue to increase . . . Even taking into account termination applications made to State tribunals, it is apparent that only a tiny proportion of dismissals result in litigation.</PARA>
<PARA>Just under two per cent, in fact. As to the alleged effects of unfair dismissal laws on small business, the chief justice noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Respondents also are a cross-section of Australian employers, except that small business seems to be under&hyphen;represented.</PARA>
<PARA>As I have said, given this truth, it is no wonder the substance of the government's new laws is basically no different. There are going to be a lot of disappointed people out there who thought the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, was going to abolish the unfair dismissal laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So why won't we vote for these laws? Because, in two important ways not related to the substance of the laws, they are grossly unfair to employees. And we will be moving amendments to address this unfairness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, the new unfair dismissal laws will apply only in the traditional federal jurisdiction. We know this was always a great concern for the Democrats&mdash;particularly to Senator Allison, and I hope she is listening up there somewhere&mdash;because they knew many employees would be thrown back to state unfair dismissal systems. In the case of Victoria, that would mean those employees would be considerably worse off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We would be tempted to have a Senator Allison amendment, but we have made a point in the last weeks in respect of Senators Stott Despoja and Murray&mdash;and, in your case, Senator Murray, we have done that on seven or eight occasions. Having regard to the time and our manner of handling this matter, we will not be quite so harsh with the Australian Democrats this week. But we did win one vote this morning, Senator Murray.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem of the federal jurisdiction has now been cured by the Kennett government's decision to give its industrial relations powers, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> including over unfair dismissal, to the federal government. How ironic it is. This simply achieves the universal coverage that we have long been calling for and that our amendments seek to achieve. We ought to call these the Jeff Kennett amendments, but we could never name amendments of ours after Jeff Kennett.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But why confine the solution only to Victorians? Have the Democrats, particularly Senators Kernot and Woodley, considered that the Borbidge government may yet gut Queensland's unfair dismissal laws? What happens then to those employees, with no access to the federal system, and a lousy state system? We should address the problem now so that it cannot arise in the future in any jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the government and the Democrats have retained the requirement for the commission to consider the viability of the employer's business before making a compensation order. We are utterly opposed to this decision. It discriminates between employees. It discriminates between employers. In fact, successful employers are penalised. If your business is a dud, you effectively get an exemption from unfair dismissal laws. But, if your business is a success, you get the unfair dismissal laws applying in full.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That the Democrats would support this fundamental unfairness is a real surprise&mdash;although, given what has been happening in the last two weeks, perhaps it is not a real surprise. We can only surmise that the Democrats no longer believe they have a constituency amongst small business, confirming something we have always known.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said in my introduction, there are a considerable number of comments the opposition could make on each of these amendments. Some of my colleagues will be speaking on them. I seek leave to incorporate seven or eight pages of comments about the amendments to this schedule.</PARA>

But, fundamentally, we are opposed to the changes to the act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There seems to have been a lot of rhetoric flying around about the unfair dismissal measure. Why we oppose this element of the bill is largely due to the fact that the most recent changes to these provisions did not take effect until 15 January 1996. They have not yet had a chance to be properly evaluated. The position of the Chief Justice of the Industrial Relations Court of Australia, Justice Murray Wilcox, is interesting to note. He refuted claims made during the election campaign that the unfair dismissal provisions were so onerous that people in small business were reluctant to hire people. On 27 February 1996, on ABC radio's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS> program he stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We meet regularly in the court with representatives of both employers and employees to review the way the court administers its affairs, and business groups suggest that things are working very smoothly. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5433"> </PARA>
<PARA>On the previous night on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> , Justice Wilcox made some interesting comments when asked whether the laws as they stood were at odds with good business. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They are at odds with bad business, and the problem is that there are too many bad managers who do not have enough respect for their employees and there are people that suffer awards against them. I mean, really, you would be appalled at some of the cases.</PARA>
<PARA>The case in Australia is a bit like some aspects of the Native Title Act, in that in some states and in some jurisdictions there might be a political interest to be able to freely sack employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been moves against allowing this model to work well, and it can work well. It is unfortunate that the ALP have some amendments to the bill, and it is also unfortunate that the opposition to a certain extent have gone along with some of the rhetoric rather than the nature of the situation. It is our belief that it has not been given a chance to work properly. It is our belief that, in some instances, there may be people who are endeavouring to make it look as if it is not working properly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In reality, we will not suddenly get thousands of people hiring people on this basis alone. If they hire on the basis that they think they will be able to dismiss people unfairly, perhaps we will need to revisit this situation. There are certain details regarding whether or not the financial situation of a company should determine whether they need to obey the law. It has certainly never been the case with people who end up being charged with social security fraud if in some instances they have absolutely no choice except to try to survive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> It has certainly not been the case in many other laws of which I know that the financial circumstances of the person involved determines whether or not they act lawfully. If a company is in trouble, there are ways that the company can act if they need to shed staff. They can talk with their staff. However, that should not mean that a company gets an exemption to treat their staff badly. I do not think it should be read that way. Unfortunate ly, I think that is what will be read as a result of what we are going through today.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to make some remarks regarding the proposals in this workplace relations bill as they relate to unfair dismissal. We have all heard the saying, `There are lies, damned lies and statistics.' One of the great lies that has been perpetrated in recent years is the one put about that the unfair dismissal laws, as enacted by the previous Labor government and amended more recently, were a barrier to employment growth. This catchcry was taken up and promulgated mainly by big business, not the small business community. Small business was out there generally getting on with the job. It was taken up by large companies, by employer and business associations, by the Liberal and National parties, by conservative commentators and by talkback radio hosts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was blurted out day after day that these unfair dismissal laws were preventing employers from employing additional people. It was put that this was particularly the case in the small business sector. My recollection of what transpired during the Senate inquiry was that very little evidence was put before that committee by small business people that went to this issue. We have heard this cry for so long now that it has almost become a self&hyphen;fulfilling prophecy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, people believed the perception rather than the facts. They listened to the rhetoric, to the hyperbole, that, if only you got rid of the unfair dismissal laws, if only you made it easier to sack people, you would somehow generate more employment. As a matter of logic, it does not stand up. I often listened to the talkback radio hosts, who seem to be experts at everything but particularly about the supposed ills of the industrial relations system. They proposed that what was needed in this country to enable more employment growth was to make it easier for employers to sack people. That defies any rational logic in my view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But let us look at the facts. Let us look at some of the statistics because on this occasion the statistics tell the truth. They put the lie to the damned lies promulgated out there by <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5434"> those who oppose these laws which were about protecting ordinary wage and salary earners in their employment. I refer particularly to an editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 28 February 1996 called `Fair and unfair dismissals'. This has never been a paper renowned for its great support of either the Labor Party or the labour movement, but this is what the editorial said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Statistics released by the Industrial Relations Court in December&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, December 1995&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">suggest that the operation of the law has not been as onerous as commonly implied. In 1994&hyphen;95, 87 per cent of the 7,749 unfair dismissal claims lodged that financial year were either settled or discontinued before determination by the court and another 4 per cent were settled or discontinued before the determination process had started. Of those determined by the court, 56 per cent were decided in the employee's favour and 44 per cent in favour of the employer. And in the 219 cases where compensation was awarded, 74 per cent involved amounts less than $10,000, about 22 per cent involved amounts between $10,000 and $20,000, and less than 4 per cent involved amounts of $20,000 or more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This suggests that much of the criticism of the law has stemmed from perceptions of its operation rather than its practice.</PARA>
<PARA>The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  editorial has got it right. What we have seen over the last couple of years is a huge beat&hyphen;up by the coalition parties and their supporters in the business community. In order to undermine the rights of employees, whether they be trade unionists or not, in this country they had to attack the unfair dismissal laws. That is consistent with the whole philosophy that runs through this bill which is about depriving people of their rights, whether they be award rights, rights in regard to hiring and firing employees or whatever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst there were a few cases that were highlighted in the press where maybe some employees had been reinstated or the employer may have been hard done by because of the processes involved in the legislation, these were then blown up to suggest that the legislation in total was some overbearing onerous burden upon employers. It was argued that if only we could get rid of it then we would see <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> nirvana, we would see this huge explosion in employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have a look at some of the employment figures. I will seek leave to incorporate this document shortly. What do the figures actually tell us? The employment figures for the period March 1994, when the unfair dismissal laws came into effect, to March 1995 actually show a very interesting picture. The source of these figures is the Bureau of Industry Economics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The figures show that in the small business sector&mdash;defined as private enterprises with less than 20 employees, except manufacturing, in which a small business is defined as one with less than 100 employees, and agriculture, in which a small business is defined as one with an estimated value of agricultural operations between $20,000 and $399,000&mdash;employment increased from an estimated 3,548,900 in March 1994 to 3,725,100 at the end of the March quarter 1995. That is a net growth of 176,200 employees in the small business sector in the 12 months that the unfair dismissal laws were in operation. That contrasts remarkably with the big business sector, which did not show anywhere near the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5435"> same growth&mdash;and indeed with the public sector, where we saw a decline.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the 10-year period between June 1985 and March 1995 small business grew in this country by 1.1 million&mdash;an extra 1.1 million employees in small business. In the larger business sector employment grew by approximately 410,000. In the public sector employment declined by 168,600. Everyone knows that the obligations with respect to dismissal in the public sector have generally been a lot tighter than they are in the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those figures put the lie to this claim that underpins these proposals that somehow the unfair dismissal laws were an impediment to employment. Employment in the small business sector grew faster than in any other sector in the Australian economy. I seek leave to incorporate this document, which was provided by the Parliamentary Library. It is sourced by the Bureau of Industry Economics and sets out employment growth in small business, big business and the public sector in the period that I have referred to.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These are technical amendments necessary to give effect to the new unfair dismissal regime, and I endorse the comments made by the Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">OPPOS 65 &amp; 66:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This provision is designed to allow the States to refer all of their responsibilities on unfair dismissal to the Commonwealth. This we think would create a massive burden on the AIRC. At present, the AIRC does not hear claims for states with an adequate alternative remedy. Even still, the number of claims to the Commission have risen massively in recent years. Under this proposal, the number of claims to the Commission could rise even more. The Democrats believe that the State must provide an adequate remedy, and will be moving an amendment to that effect. That is a more appropriate approach than that being pursued by the Opposition with these amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GOVT/DEM 33/OPPOS 67</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a technical amendment flowing from the High Court decision on the use of the external affairs power to underpin termination of employment. We support his amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GOVT/DEM 34</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment seeks to change the objects of the part to reflect subsequent amendments which make it clear that claims for both unfair dismissals and unlawful dismissals (under 170CK) commence in the Commission. Under the bilI as it stood, claims for unlawful dismissal had to commence in the Court where the claim was a matter listed in 170CK. The amended bill will allow all applications to commence in the Commission, with the applicant then deciding at the end of conciliation whether to arbitrate it in the Commission under 170CE or the Court under 170CK. I am happy to jointly move this amendment. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5437"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">OPPOS 68, 74 &amp; 87:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think these amendments have been superseded by the recent High Court decision. The simple fact is that the provisions of the fair go all round test could not rely on the external affairs power, based on ILO conventions, according to the High Court. As such, these amendments, and the attempt to base these provisions on the ILO is conditionally unsound, and we will oppose them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GOVT/DEM 35:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These are further technical amendments flowing from the High Court decision and the decision to commence actions for unlawful dismissal in the Commission under subdivision B. I have nothing to add to what the Minister has said, other than to endorse the amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">OPPOS 69, 72 &amp; 73:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These provisions seek to extend the Federal jurisdiction to all employees using external affairs. As I commented earlier, I believe that is a constitutionally unsound approach, highlighted by the recent High Court case. We will oppose these amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GOVT DEM 36 (same as OPPOS 70 &amp; 71)</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">OPPOS 75-77</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I really don't think that these amendments are necessary. The bill as it stands follows very closely the wording of the ILO Convention in relation to its exemptions. We have been advised that it has the same effect, but reads a little better. As to deleting clauses (2) to (4) these clarify aspects of class (e) which might be later excluded by regulation. Obviously if those regulations go too far, we will move to disallow them. So, I think that the Opposition simply has not read the clause closely before drafting this amendment.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GOVT/DEM 37-8, 52-55</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All of these provisions will allow for proceeding for unlawful dismissal to commence in the Commission rather than the Court. I think the Minister has explained the amendment adequately, and I am happy to jointly move these amendments. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">OPPOS 80:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats believe that 170CE(3) adequately allows the Commission to accept late applications it would be unfair not to do so. That in our view is an adequate out for workers whose applications are late for good reason. The bill also increases the time to lodge applications from the current 14 to 21 days, providing even more scope for applicants. Therefore, we regard this amendment as unnecessary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">OPPOS 79 &amp; 88:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats believe that written notice is good employment practice, but may not be appropriate in absolutely every case. The dismissal occurs when the employee is clearly dismissed. Obviously there must be some event, and in most cases that would be written notice. But, we believe that the requirement for written notice in every case is a little excessive, and therefore we oppose this amendment as one of the elements of the Labor system which created excessive problems for some employers and such hostility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GOVT/DEM 39-41</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments cover the technical arrangements of where an employee elects at the end of conciliation whether they will take a case for unfair dismissal in the Commission for arbitration, or for unlawful dismissal in the Court. This distinction is necessary because unlawful dismissal claims must proceed along the judicial rather than the administrative stream. The provisions ensure that employees get to make the choice after conciliation, rather than at the very beginning of the process, and we think that is more appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GOVT/DEMS 42-44:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments seek to place into proper perspective the matters to which the Commission must have regard before granting remedy. We think that the original bill placed too heavy an emphasis on the viability of the employer. While this might be a relevant circumstance in the very limited cases where the making of an order would actually touch on the viability&mdash;the continued viability of an employer, this is unlikely to be relevant to most cases. The longer list of matters to which the Commission would have regard we believe provides more appropriate guidance to the Commission on the various matters to which it should have regard.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I said, the term "Viability of the employer's undertaking, establishment or service" is of very narrow application. It would be relevant only in those cases were the making of an order would have the effect of threatening that viability, that is threatening the continued existence of the business. Here we are talking about very small businesses, and I would doubt if it could be argued in very many cases at all. A business wishing to argue <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5438"> viability obviously would have to be one so close to the breadline that it would be prepared to open up its books for the Commission to determine whether the viability truly was effected by the order. As I said, these are very rare and narrow circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">OPPOS 81 &amp; 82:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think it addressed the concerns reflected in this amendment about the viability of the employer in speaking to my earlier amendment. This amendment, given the amendment we have just discussed, is in my view unnecessary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GOVT/DEMS 45:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a small amendment to ensure that the starting point for the bill is the same as the indexed compensation figure in the current Act. I might add the Democrats opposed the imposition of the original $30,000 cap by the ALP in 1994. We still think that a cap of $32,000 is way too low, but this is a status quo amendment, so I am prepared to support it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">OPPOS 83-85 (change 170CH(8) + (9) p.51)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We oppose these amendments, as we believe that the bill as it stands provides for adequate remedies. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GOVT/DEMS 46-51 (170CJ):</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These are all amendments to the ability of the Commission to order costs. Amendment 46, 47, 48 and 50 cover the inclusion of unlawful dismissals within the Commission, allowing an order for costs against an organisation which has brought a vexatious claim or a claim without reasonable cause. I would like to point out that these terms are very narrow in their scope, and deliberately so. It would be our expectation in supporting these amendments that the power to award costs would be used sparingly, and only in exceptional cases which are clearly vexatious in its true sense, or truly without reasonable cause. Indeed, if it becomes the causes that costs are awarded by the Commission on anything other than a rare and exceptional case, the Democrats will be seeking to remove the costs jurisdiction or further narrow it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendment 49 significantly tightens up the conditions under which an employee can be subject to costs for failing to discontinue a matter. New section 170CJ(3) will require the employee to have elected to continue the matter to arbitration under 170CFA, but then discontinuing it at an unreasonably late time. At that stage, the employee would have received the assessment of the Commission required at the end of conciliation as required by new section 170CF(2). So, before being liable for a costs order, they will have in hands an assessment of the merits, will have elected to continue, and then changed their mind. That is not unreasonable. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendment 51 allows for the Commission to establish a schedule of costs to prevent Carmen Lawrence style massive costs being awarded. The costs schedule in particular will allow unions representing their members to recover costs where an employer has unreasonably prolonged proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In all, we believe that this costs regime is very narrow and restricted but balanced, and is supportable on these limited grounds. I would point out that the Federal Court has had the powers to award costs in relation to unfair dismissals under Labor's unfair dismissal model, and that what we are proceeding to do is not inconsistent with that approach.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">OPPOS 86 &amp; 102 (to oppose 170CJ)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats are opposed to this amendment. We believe that the amended 170CJ provides a fair balance between the right to take an action with just cause and protection for employers against unreasonable action.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">OPPOS 90 (change 170CP(6) p.57)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats oppose this amendment. The bill provides a clear discretion to accept applications out of time, and extends the time for making application from 14 to 21 days. We think the balance is right.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">OPPOS 91 &amp; 92</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats are opposed to this amendment. The term "alternative" has created major legal minefields. The Commission will still be required to ensure under both 170FC and l70GC that the alternative remedy gives effect to our legal obligations under Article 12 and Article 13 of the ILO Termination of Employment Convention. I think that is an adequate safeguard.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">OPPOS 93 &amp; 94:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats again feel that this section is dubious constitutionally. The High Court in its recent judgement on these provisions gave the ILO Conventions a very literal interpretation, so literal that any order made under 170CH that a dismissal was harsh or unjust could still breach the Convention. This is very untidy law, and we are opposed to it. The award review process over the next 18 months will obviously review clauses that are obsolete and which fail to meet the objects of the Act, which include assisting in meeting our international obligations. This amendment, in short, is bad law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GOVT/DEM 56-61</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are a range of technical provisions which seek to further clarify the circumstances of double jeopardy, ensuring that employers do not face two claims in respect of the one dismissal. Significantly, these provisions broaden out the grounds on which a person who has commenced another action <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5439"> can approach the Commission from merely want of jurisdiction, to include discontinuation of the earlier action. I commend the amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">OPPOS 95-99:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats oppose these amendments as unnecessary, as the additional ground of a State award is clearly subsumed by the category of State legislation in 170HB(1)(c).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GOVT/DEM 62 (Same as OPPOS 100):</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">OPPOS 101:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GREEN 28:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats are opposed to this amendment. We have consistently supported reform of unfair dismissals law to replace the cumbersome, legalistic and procedural ludicrous old laws with something a bit more practical. This bill achieves that.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This has already been picked up with the amended form of our double jeopardy provisions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is at least gratifying to see that after 90 years of industrial arbitration at a national level there is bipartisan support for the right to reinstatement through the federal jurisdiction. For many, many years this right was not available. There was no legislative prescription which enabled employees employed under federal awards to seek reinstatement, although such a right may have existed in some states. So at least now we can say that there is bipartisan support for this right, although the amendments that Labor moves in relation to this schedule of the legislation are amendments which obviously I support as improving the legislative basis for the reinstatement power.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was historically the case that the only way the federal commission could act in relation to reinstatement was where there was the consent of both the employer and obviously the employee's representative to accepting a recommendation of the commission. This amendment now enshrines in the legislation the fact that there is bipartisan support for this important right to be retained by employees Australia&hyphen;wide to the extent that this legislation will, in tandem with state legislation, maintain reinstatement rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support Senator Forshaw's comments in relation to the fraud that has been perpetrated about the inadequacies of the previous legislation and those remarks that Senator Sherry has put on the record in relation to the fact that these changes were probably quite unnecessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also point out that, in relation to one aspect of the provisions as I understand they will appear following the passage of this <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5440"> section, with the removal from the list of permissible matters of matters relating to the rights of union members to represent others, those rights no longer will be able to appear in awards following the transitional period. In proposed section 170CK the participation in trade union activities during working hours can be done only with the consent of the employer, whereas in the past that would have been done by permission of the award.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So to an extent this provision has put in jeopardy those people who seek to represent their fellow workers because they have been elected for example as a union delegate or representative. If I am wrong, perhaps the parliamentary secretary can clarify that matter so that I can allay the fears of a number of people I know who would be concerned that taking an action as a union representative during working hours in the future might place them in jeopardy of being dismissed without an obvious right of reinstatement pursuant to proposed section 170CK.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to ask a question of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment. My question probably arises generally from the amendments that have just been moved. Given the change to the environment which is effected by this and other amendments and the long-term constitutional question that has been asked about members of the federal commission exercising powers of reinstatement, in the past there has been some question mark about whether that power is a judicial function rather than an arbitral function. In a number of cases in the past, such actions have been struck down by the High Court.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, it did not say anything bad. The letter basically approved what the Democrats were doing in relation to industrial relations. In the last state <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> election in Western Australia previous to this there were great concerns about industrial relations and one of the slogans from the union movement was: `Kennett happen here? Only if you get Court.' The implication of that was that there were great concerns over what was happening with industrial relations in Victoria. People were concerned that industrial relations in Western Australia would get as bad as in Victoria.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no need to worry any more because the federal Democrat&hyphen;government industrial relations agreement will now be the same as what is in Victoria. The fact that it does have the tick of approval from the Premier of Victoria, Jeff Kennett, indicates just what an agreement it is. I think it is necessary to note that the concerns of workers have been carried through to the extent that we now have federal legislation that looks so appalling that the Premier of Victoria has given it his stamp of approval.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, as most of the changes the opposition have requested to termination of employment have been lost, I now seek their support in opposing this schedule in toto because I do believe that we are going to go backwards.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wish to record my appreciation of the cooperation of the Australian Democrats in securing major reforms in our industrial relations system with the positive shift towards a national unitary system.</PARA>
<PARA>We all know the fact is that two things have happened: firstly, as a result of Labor-Democrat amendments during Labor's term of government, the ability of Victorian employees to move to the federal system was enhanced, as a result of which Premier Kennett has very realistically accepted the impetus towards a national unitary system. There is no doubt that if you ask anyone in the Victorian industrial relations system whether the movement towards the new federal bill will be an improvement or not over Premier Kennett's environment they will say that it will be a massive improvement.</PARA>

<PARA>Minister Kierath has been beating me to death because of the Democrat amendments.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Irrespective of whether or not Mr Kierath does or does not like changes to the federal system or changes that might impact on the state system, there are people in Western Australia who are currently in the federal system who will have their lives changed immensely. There are people who had a choice before who have less of a choice now. The number of people who may be on awards, paid or otherwise, or in different sorts of agreements and who will have to go into different agreements will be quite a lot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Different states had different numbers of people moving over. We know that, in Victoria, there was more ability to move over to a federal system. We also know that, in Western Australia in recent times, many people have moved to the federal system. There are many aspects of this bill which will affect a large number of workers in Western Australia and, perhaps even more so, in Victoria. It is not surprising that the loudest and clearest idea of the impacts of this bill are being felt in Victoria and people are very disappointed.

<PARA>This amendment deletes the exemption for small businesses created in the termination provisions of the bill. I mentioned this briefly earlier.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We feel that termination provisions are not onerous. I mentioned before that Justice Wilcox states that `it simply means that, if there is an allegation against an employee of poor performance or dishonesty or some other misconduct, the employee must be given the opportunity to make a defence'. It does not require written notice; it does not require a system of warnings; it does not require a mini&hyphen;trial. What it does mean is that, if the employer wants to sack the employee, the employee must be told, `We think you have done so and so. What do you say about that?' The employer must be prepared to listen to the explanation because sometimes there is an innocent explanation for something that looks bad. I think that is fair&mdash;it is not unfair&mdash;to be given the opportunity to explain yourself, even when something makes you look totally guilty. You all know of situations where appearances can be deceptive and people should be given the basic right to explain themselves. Consequently, we feel that there should be no reason why the size of the business should create an excuse for being exempted from these very reasonable provisions.</PARA>

<PARA>This amendment deletes provisions in the bill with regard to remedies on arbitration which require the commission to have regard to the effect of the order on the viability of the employer's undertaking, establishment or service. In similar vein to our amendment 30, we feel that the viability of an employer's business should not be used as an excuse for not making payment to an employee in lieu of reinstatement. Where else in legislation do we incorporate similar provisions? It is worth quoting in this context from a submission to the committee by Professor Andrew Stewart from the school of law at Flinders University. He states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a matter of principle, it is difficult to see why this concession should be made to an employer's financial circumstances, when that same concession is not made in so many other laws. If a firm inflicts loss through breach of contract or negligence, its obligation to pay damages is not reduced according to whether the firm can afford to pay, whatever the consequences that may ensue. So why should it be any different for an unfair dismissal claim? The message that this provision appears to send is that unfair dismissal claims are not in the end that serious. But they are. The arbitrary depravation of the opportunity to earn a living is one of the worst calamities that can befall a person. If an unfairly dismissed worker cannot quickly find another source of income, the obligation of the employer to compensate for any loss should not be set aside or <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reduced merely because the employer's own livelihood may be at risk. In the end, a wrong is a wrong and should be redressed.</PARA>
<PARA>Professor Stewart's argument is very persuasive. I commend the amendment to the chamber.</PARA>

<PARA>Given the government's announcement that it would institute a filing fee of $50 for termination actions, we seek to amend section 359 of the act, which gives the power to the minister to make this regulation, to specifically state that the power conferred by the subsection does not include power to make regulations with respect to any fees in relation to division 3 of part VIA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note that many groups have condemned the proposal to impose a filing fee for termination matters. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, for example, stated in its submission to the Senate committee that it considers that filing fees are `undesirable in termination matters'. The Association for Non-English Speaking Women of Australia also commented on this issue and stated in their submission that `the $50 filing fee is prohibitive for many low income women and will often make the difference between them pursuing their dismissal or not'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know that, should their claims go forward to court, the costs for people to receive redress for what could be the breaking of a legal contract could be enormous. The ball is really in the court of the employer in so many different ways in this bill. This is just one of them. We have no indication that it will stop at $50. Perhaps at a time when there might be a number of people requiring redress, they will just ratchet it up another notch.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I strongly oppose a filing fee on principle and in fact. If there is a contract, then people should have legal access to contract and they should not have to pay even for <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> filing to achieve some redress. I do not think it is a matter of trivia; I think it is important that people do have access to that, especially if those people have a very low income, are already severely disadvantaged or do not have $50 lying around to lodge a filing fee.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SCHEDULE 8</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am very pleased to move these amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments reflect the longstanding commitment of the Australian Democrats to protecting and furthering the interests of women in the workplace.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments re-insert into the bill those sections of Part VIA which give the Industrial Relations Commission jurisdiction over equal remuneration for work of equal value. They follow on from the Democrats' strong support for the insertion of these provisions in the original Act in 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats continue to hold the view that this is a particularly important and significant part of the Act. We believe that, while there may be only one test case underway at the moment under these provisions, it is crucial they be retained. That test case seeks to deal with the area of over award payments (currently flowing about three to one in favour of men) and that case alone is justification for retaining and shoring-up the Commission's jurisdiction in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats believe it is entirely appropriate to keep this jurisdiction to the Commission. We believe the Commission should have a role in ensuring our international obligations are capable of being enforced in relation to affording equal remuneration for work of equal value. I am very pleased that we have been able to persuade the Coalition, which is usually strident in its opposition to the use of the external affairs power, to agree to the re-instatement of this jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This provision allows the Commission to make an order to ensure that employees will be afforded equal remuneration for work of equal value.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The phrase `equal remuneration for work of equal value' will have the same meaning as in ILO Convention 100 and includes award rates, rates specified in agreements, over award pay and non-monetary benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The importance of these provisions lies in their potential rather than in their current real practical effect. Their value will only be realised if unions follow the lead set by the ACTU and use this jurisdiction to run test cases.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In my view, it is a great credit to the current leadership of the ACTU that it was prepared to take this issue on and use these provisions to run the current test case on over award payments. That action by the ACTU represents a positive and welcome attempt to drive change in an area in which progress has been conspicuously lacking for more than 20 years&mdash;and (with these provisions now restored to the Act) it sends a strong signal to the union movement that it can&mdash;and should take <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5454"> up the issue of equal remuneration for work of equal value.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are proposing one minor technical change to the provisions. This is a `double jeopardy' provision to ensure that applicants do not use the AIRC approach while pursuing another adequate alternative remedy. Where that remedy fails for want of jurisdiction or is discontinued, then the AIRC route will be open.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The re-instatement of this important jurisdiction is part of the large number of changes negotiated by the Democrats which will significantly benefit women.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As pointed out earlier in this debate, other gains for women are: the Commission will be required in exercising its award-making powers for the first time to pay particular regard to equal pay for work of equal value, and to the need to eliminate discrimination against employees;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 89A will also make it clear that the Commission can and should proceed to insert anti-discrimination clauses in awards. In addition, the accelerated award simplification process will be required to review award clauses which are discriminatory&mdash;a process which has been proceeding at something less than a snail's pace.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because of the Democrats' negotiations, the Australian Workplace Agreements provisions will also be amended to require the Employment Advocate to have particular regard to the needs of women and workers with family responsibilities in exercising their powers. AWAs will also be required to include a model anti-discrimination clause.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Certified Agreements provisions are also amended to require the Commission to have special regard to the needs of women when Agreement conditions are being explained to employees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, section 1 70LU(5) precludes the inclusion in an award of a clause which the Commission believes would be discriminatory on the grounds of gender.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What we have done in securing these changes is ensure that the issues of equal remuneration, of a fairer deal for women workers, and of a fairer deal for workers with family responsibilities, are put `up-front' and `in lights' in the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And that means that these changes form a package which represents a major improvement not only on the original bill as tabled by the Government, but on the existing Act as well.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now the Opposition has criticised the Democrats for our position on equal pay. They thought they had discovered an issue to run on. It has been a rather desperate attempt to re&hyphen;establish credibility on a range of issues by re&hyphen;writing history. Unfortunately for our Labor critics it is proving a bit <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> difficult for them to paint themselves as the champion of working Australians with a 13 year record behind them of doing the exact opposite in government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Look at the record. Labor cut real wages. Labor left 800,000 Australian workers unemployed. Labor made it tougher for the unemployed and for sick workers to access social security benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Through its ideological obsession with `level playing fields', Labor destroyed employment in the Australian manufacturing industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes . . . government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And as time passes, we will be able to assess this coalition government's performance on the same matter. They cannot hide behind Labor's past record forever!</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I say to the Labor Party: they would be entitled to criticise the Democrats if they were doing so on the basis of a different and more credible policy record in government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And it is rather hypocritical of Labor to expect others to now support Labor amendments which they were not prepared to move or support when they were in government. These are purely political amendments. If they were not appropriate then, why are they now? The answer: being in opposition!</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So I can understand why opposition senators sought to say we were betraying the women of Australia for saying the Commission must have regard to equal remuneration for work of equal value.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And why opposition senators have spent so much time and repetition on one word of Section 88B, which sets out the things the commission must have regard to in exercising its award making jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Labor is clutching at straws in this debate and it knows it!</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 88B is not inconsistent with our support for re&hyphen;insertion of Part VIA. Equal pay, as understood by the Commission in its successive equal pay cases and equal pay principles, covers payment for work. That is what awards are about. If a condition falls outside the definition of `pay', it is picked up in the general discrimination provisions. Or it is picked up under Part VIA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be pointed out that the Commission takes a wide view of the 1972 Equal Pay Test Case decision, as recently as last November in the Weipa case, reaffirming that the Principles continue to apply, and that equal pay should be based on a fair assessment in the circumstances of the particular cases brought before the Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact of the matter is that when this bill is passed, it will be the first time that an Australian parliament has directed the Commission to have <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5455"> particular regard to this issue, and to the complementary instruction to have particular regard to the need to eliminate discrimination.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is a significant achievement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What these amendments do is put up-front the requirement for the Commission to take these issues seriously and to take action on them&mdash;in its award making powers, in award simplification, in agreements and through Part VIA in over-award payments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With these weapons at their disposal, the Commission can now start to attack the systemic discrimination which, 27 years after the first equal pay case and 10 years after the Sex Discrimination Act, still sees women earning on average 30 per cent less than men.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Labor Party might like to explain why in the last ten years the relativity of women's full time wages to men's full time wages not risen, and is stuck at 78.3%. In fact, in the last two to three years, it has fallen, a point clearly made in the DIR report on Enterprise Bargaining released last month. No progress in ten years, if anything women were going backwards under Labor's industrial relations model. That is ten years of a Labor Government failing to make even the slightest inroads into equal pay.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(I seek to incorporate a document which is an extract from ABS statistics in relation to male and female full time earnings).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Interestingly enough, that inequality in both pay and access to work&hyphen;related benefits did not stop the Labor Government from raising the pension age for women a couple of years' back&mdash;to the distress and detriment of a great many Australian women workers in their 40s and 50s. And that decision was taken even though under the Labor government's superannuation polices, three quarters of the $7 billion of tax concessions flowed to men, even though men make up just 45 per cent of Australia's post age 60 population.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I remind you that the Democrats voted against the move on women's pensions, and have constantly criticised Labor's failure to deliver a superannuation regime fairer to women&mdash;so don't come in here and try to pretend that 13 years of a Labor Government did anything wonderful for women workers in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So Labor should not come in here and condemn us for negotiating amendments which will provide an important tool in commencing the hard work of closing that stubborn gender pay gap&mdash;a gap they so conspicuously failed to close in more than a decade in government. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>

Perhaps the Democrats regard these minimum wage provisions as non&hyphen;core powers and jurisdiction of the commission! The minimum wage provisions are also important in giving effect to Australia's international obligations under the minimum wages convention. Perhaps the Democrats and the government have embarked on a process of determining which of our international obligations are core ones that must be preserved, and which are non&hyphen;core obligations that can be jettisoned at will.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because I will table for incorporation in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  a detailed document explaining the opposition's response to the various government&hyphen;Democrat and Green amendments, and detailing our own amendments, I will confine my comments to just a few key issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps most fundamentally, the opposition opposes the creation of yet another stream of workplace agreement, non&hyphen;union certified agreements. The opposition will be moving therefore to delete division 2 of schedule 9. We believe there is simply no justification for the creation of a non&hyphen;union stream of certified agreements, particularly as these just make a complicated bill and a complicated industrial relations system even more complicated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is simpler and more efficient to create just one stream for non&hyphen;union agreements. Although we object to them, the government has done this by creating AWAs. AWAs are able to be made on a multi&hyphen;employee basis and will be tested by reference to the same `no disadvantage test' as certified agreements. If the government really has faith in its new AWAs, why not rely on these as the preferred non&hyphen;union agreements?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are three other areas to which I want to draw attention&mdash;in the main because the opposition will be moving amendments to deal with the problems we see. The first is an amendment which has been recommended to us by the Association of Professional Engineers, Scientists and Managers, Australia. They are concerned that the new arrangements for certified agreements will allow the interests of their members at a workplace&mdash;and invariably their members are well and truly in the minority&mdash;to be swamped by the interests of the other majority workforce. This is most likely to occur because of the requirement that there be majority approval for a certified agreement at a particular workforce. In these circumstances, the votes of the inevitable <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5458"> employees minority of APESMA members are likely to be swamped.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To address this concern, we will be moving an amendment which permits employers to enter into a certified agreement with a distinct category of employees in their workforce where the employer chooses to do so. We can see no valid argument against giving employers their freedom to choose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, we will be moving another `Murray amendment'&mdash;we are not letting you get off too lightly, Senator Murray&mdash;in relation to youth wages, although I am just as happy to call it a `Stott Despoja amendment' if you want her to take responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill, as agreed by the Democrats, will permit junior rates to continue in certified agreements until at least the year 2000, with the commission having the power to extend them beyond that on a case by case basis. I remind the government and the Democrats that junior rates are discriminatory. They permit discrimination between two workers simply on the basis of age, even though they are doing the same work and have the same experience. We are opposed to junior rates and we thought the Democrats were, too.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, we are not going to win on our preferred position, so we will accept the fall&hyphen;back provision recommended by Senator Murray in his report. He recommended at page 353&mdash;I offer it as commended reading to the nation that is listening&mdash;that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . age&hyphen;based discrimination in relation to wages ceases as from 1 July 1997 as set out in the current Act. However, the parties may be able to approach the Commission on an award or agreement basis to seek an extension of up to two years at a time provided that they can demonstrate special circumstances and that they intend and are making progress in replacing age&hyphen;based wages with wages based on skill.</PARA>
<PARA>Well, Senator Murray, that is the precise effect of the amendment we will be moving and we will look forward to you voting with us for a change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third amendment that we will be moving is in relation to the termination of certified agreements. The original proposal in the bill to permit unilateral termination after the expiry date was very unfair as it would <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have given the employer disproportionate bargaining power. It would have enabled an employer to threaten the workforce with significant reductions in existing entitlements&mdash;for example, going back to the basic award entitlements&mdash;if they did not agree to proposals for a new agreement by the time of expiry of the old one. It would have effectively required employees to take industrial action just to retain their existing conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We accept that these concerns have been ameliorated to some extent by the new requirement for review by the commission before termination can be approved. Because this provision is an improvement, the opposition will vote in support of it. But the opposition's preferred position is that the termination of a certified agreement should only be permitted if a valid majority of persons employed at the time, whose employment is subject to the agreement, had genuinely agreed to the termination. We believe that whilst an agreement is in effect it should only be terminated with the agreement of the parties. An employer should not at any time have the capacity to effectively remove existing conditions of employment from employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition also believes that the commission should be required to determine that it is in the public interest for a certified agreement to be terminated. The requirement proposed by the government&hyphen;Democrats amendment that the commission is required to determine that that termination is not contrary to the public interest is not good enough. It is an example of a subtle change in the onus of proof that the government has apparently been able to sell to the Democrats. But it would be wise for the Democrats to appreciate that termination of a certified agreement under this new regime will usually have very dire consequences because employees will fall back to mere safety net conditions of employment. The strictest public interest requirement should be insisted upon before employees are faced with this appalling outcome. The amendment we will move will ensure this is the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I indicated in my earlier comments, we have some 14 or 15 pages of comment on <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5459"> each of the various amendments&mdash;government, Democrat, Greens and our own.

<STATE> (Tasmania)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(5.27 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In relation to Labor amendment No. 107, I think the question has to be asked: what have the government and the Democrats got to hide in relation to these agreements? Presumably having established minimum conditions tests, what is the problem with those legislative aspects being tested against a particular agreement? The environment that the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996, as it is proposed to be amended, will establish is an environment where potentially there will be no critical determination of a particular agreement against those tests, given that the only parties potentially to proceedings will be supporting the approval of an agreement, and potentially will not want that agreement tested rigorously against the minimum conditions tests which are laid down, I think, in other parts of the bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats have said that they only wish, for example, employee organisations to have a right to appear in those matters when a member has authorised them in writing to appear. Presumably that is a member who is party to or affected by the agreement in accordance with the provisions of the legislation. I think it is 170LK(4). That begs a couple of questions. Firstly, in a seasonal industry, the potential remains&mdash;I think we have seen these sorts of circumstances in the past&mdash;where an agreement can be made with a work force at a particular time without having regard to the fact that the agreement will bind other people who are not employed at that time, but are normally employed on a seasonal basis. For example, in the fruit picking industry certain employers would be able to establish a certified agreement with a small number of employees which would bind a large number of casuals who were later employed under the terms of that agreement although they had no say in the matter. There would be no person or authority able to represent the interests of those employees; they would have no say in the matter and they would be bound.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there is clearly one type of case where employees can be bound and where they have <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> no say. They clearly have no right to representation because they are not employed at the time the agreement is made. As I understand 170LK(4), they would have no right to ask that a union represent them in the bargaining process, because at that particular time they are not employed even though, from year to year, they might regularly return to the employment, for example, of a particular grower.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is just one example. You can also talk about certain fish processing industries where employment is seasonal and casual and where the same circumstances can arise. Again, those employees would have no right whatsoever in relation to the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That brings me to the second point. Traditionally&mdash;and I think this has been recognised by the High Court, and I referred to this in the second reading debate&mdash;employee organisations have been taken to represent the class of employees that their rules cover. That is, it covers present and future employees. Those organisations have a role in the coverage of people who are not currently employed in a particular occupation but who might be employed in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certified agreements, when made, do not simply bind those people who are a party to their making. On the one hand, an employer may sell a business or transmit the business in some way, and another employer would pick up the benefits or obligations of that certified agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the other hand, employees are a changing group. The employees who agreed to the certified agreement at the point it was made may depart and a new group of employees may arrive. Those employees would have had no say in the document, and their only choice as to the terms of condition is whether or not they accept the job and whether or not the government believes it is a good employment environment. I think the reality is that there is still a fairly high level of unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those people who are seeking employment, particularly in some of the regional areas of Australia where employment is difficult to obtain, have no ability to intervene. The only bodies that have been established and which <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5469"> appear to represent the rights of future employees are registered employee organisations. Yet the provisions in relation to certified agreements would exclude those organisations from appearing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have heard the arguments about uninvited parties appearing in proceedings in relation to certified agreements in the past. Frankly, those arguments do not stand up when you consider that the certified agreement will cover a group of people&mdash;employer and employee potentially&mdash;who would have had no say in relation to the process of making the document and would have had no say as to the testing of the document against the minimum criteria established in the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government and the Democrats are not satisfied that those minimum criteria will stand the test in each case. If they were satisfied that they would stand up to the test, why would there be concern about scrutiny&mdash;about their actually being tested? Someone who wants to represent a point of view as to what those conditions might mean cannot have a say.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many instances at law where organisations appear as so-called friends of the court to put a view on a particular matter. Why is this different, given that we are talking about documents which have the potential to bind people, other than the parties to their making, to them?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that the Democrats ought to give serious consideration to this matter. They may not think it is serious but, on the other hand, what is there to hide by the testing of certified agreements by registered employee organisations? I would be interested to hear the views of Senator Campbell and Senator Murray on this matter.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator O'Brien, I think you really hit the nail on the head when you said that you have heard the arguments in relation to uninvited parties. You believe they do not stand up. We believe they do. </PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government, through its legislation as it is being amended as we go along, wants to create a different system to what we have. Basically, employees will have the choice as to whether or not they seek the involvement of a union. We believe they should have that choice. You believe that unions or employee representatives should be able to go there without being invited by employees. We believe amendment 107, which we are debating at the moment, provides rights for intervention by unions that are far too open-ended and vague. We would prefer the employees to have the choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for your argument that we are scared of allowing these agreements to be tested, that is simply not the case. If there is any doubt as to whether they meet the criteria, nothing stands in the way of any of the employees seeking representation. Furthermore, the Industrial Relations Commission itself will test the agreements against the award standards for all employees, present and future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is not a matter of our being worried about having them tested because we want to ensure that individuals in Australia have a choice as to whether they are represented by unions or some other organisation. It is a matter of giving them that choice and ensuring that that choice is freely exercised. I do not expect that we will resolve our difference on that issue here or for many years to come.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know whether, in the 13 years of Labor government, the number of union members who were senators declined. But I do know that, under 13 years of Labor government, the number of union members in Australia declined enormously. That is part of a world trend, and I accept that. It was probably not the fault of the Labor senators or the then Labor government. It is a fact that two&hyphen;thirds of employees are not union members. We as a parliament are not here to defend the privileges of unions; we are here to defend their proper role in society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We, as honourable senators know, agree with the government on this matter. Opposition amendment 107 would allow unions to intervene in hearings about agreements where the employees frankly do not want to be <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5470"> represented by them. The rights of employees who do want to be represented by a union are firmly entrenched in these provisions, particularly with amendments from the Democrats to prohibit employers from attempting to coerce employees not to be represented by unions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given these protections, we believe there is no argument for unions intervening where the employees do not want them to, as much as the union senators might like that. Unions should confine their activities to representing the 33 per cent of workers who are their members and seeking to persuade the 67 per cent who are not to join, rather than deigning to claim to represent them.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a misrepresentation of the situation in Australia to say that the proper role of unions is only to represent their members. I do not believe that has ever been the case, and I would like to think it never will be, because I believe that collective bargaining is essential in Australia and elsewhere. It is for all people in Australia, and it makes for a better work force and better productivity if that ability is maintained.

All of these aspects are important to the understanding of a proposed certified agreement which will dictate the pay and conditions for the workers who finally agree to it.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By leave I seek to move these amendments together. These amendments seek to provide important protections for employees prior to the making of an agreement by extending from 5 to 14 days the period between employees receiving an agreement and voting to approve it, and by requiring the employer to take reasonable steps to ensure that the terms of the agreement are explained to the employees proposed to be covered. These provisions, combined with the ability of employees to nominate and have recognition a union to represent them in non-union agreements, will help to ensure that employees genuinely consent to the agreement. Subsequent amendments 87 provide additional protection to ensure that the explanation takes into account the person's particular circumstances and that an employee is not subject to coercion, while clauses 170LT(6) and (6A) will make it clear that these requirements must be met before the agreement can be certified.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats are opposed to this amendment. Indeed, it is a little strange to include this provision in the certified agreements provisions as all certified agreements are, in fact collective bargains. In later amendments, we will move amendments to make it clear that employees will have the right to be clearly represented by their union, and also to ensure workers are not unfairly excluded from agreements. The fact that certified agreement override AWAs, and the fact that the Commission has a positive duty to facilitate the making of a certified agreement under 170L if a bargaining period is nominated, but no positive duty to facilitate the making of AWAs are all further bricks in the wall enforcing the right to bargain collectively.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">170LRB proposes a notification provision. What we have instead chosen to support is that employees must be notified that they have their right to be represented by a union.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GOVT/DEM 86 (No disadvantage test)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am very pleased to support this amendment, easily the most important in the certified agreements changes. This amendment ensures that certified agreements must pass the no-disadvantage test outlined in Schedule 13. That requires that the agreement, on balance, does not result in a reduction in the overall terms and conditions of employment under the relevant award or other law of the Commonwealth, State or Territory that is relevant. This is a much broader but also more flexible no disadvantage test than the narrow and rigid 8 minium conditions provided in the original bill. The section also allows that the Commission may allow an agreement to be approved which does not meet the no disadvantage test where the approval would be not contrary to the public interest. This reflects the public interest test already found in 170MC(2) of the current Act. I might add the provision of subclause 170LT(3) provides the Commission with a much broader public interest scope than does 170MC(2) does now, in that the Commission can refuse an agreement that meets the no disadvantage test on public interest grounds, something it can't do now.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a technical provision which flows on from the establishment of section 170MX awards to make it clear that employees taking industrial action during the term of a certified agreement or a 170MX award are not engaging in protected action. Industrial action taken during the course of an agreement is not protected and would be subject to the Commission making order or directions under its normal dispute settling powers.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We support this amendment for the reasons outlined by the Minister</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GOVT/DEM 105-121:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These provisions modify section 170MX to add an additional ground where the Commission can arbitrate after a failed bargaining period in respect of paid rates employees. The provisions also are amended to make it clear that determinations under 170MX will be awards rather than orders, adding to their stature. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5477"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The additional ground for arbitration is found in 170MW(6A). These provisions establish three conditions for access to the paid rates arbitration. Paragraph (a) established the category of employees generally covered by the provision as the kind of employees who, prior to the commencement of the section, were the kind of employees whose wages and conditions would be covered by a paid rates award, or would have been if an employment agreement had not prevailed over the award. The term "kind of employees" is particularly significant. This refers to the general category of employees rather than to the specific employees themselves. For example, government employees are in all states but Victoria, covered by paid rates awards. And, up until the abolition of their paid rates award in 1992, Victorian workers were also governed by paid rates awards. So clearly, government employees generally, including Victorian workers currently award free, are the "kind of employees" covered by paid rates awards. Similarly, future statutory authorities or Government departments set up within the Government sector would also fall within the category of the "kind of employees" covered by paid rates</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">awards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Paragraph (b) adds the further requirement that where that kind of employees were customarily covered by a state or Federal award, they were determined by paid rates award. Again, this clearly picks up the situation of Victorian workers as they were covered by a paid rates award when they had award coverage. But, it would not pick up the situation where the former paid rates award was converted to a minimum rates award as has happened for example, in the building industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Paragraph (c) requires the Commission to consider if there is no reasonable prospect of the parties reaching an agreement during the bargaining period. The paid rates provisions, unlike the ground in subsections (2) to (6) does not require the organising or taking of industrial action as a pre-condition to arbitration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Upon terminating the bargaining period under 170MW, the Commission is required to try to exercise its arbitration powers under 170MX(2) unless it has already attempted conciliation during the bargaining period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission can then proceed to arbitrate a settlement under 170MX(3), which will take the form of an award. An award under section 170MX(3) will, as made clear in 170MY(2) not be limited by section 89A to allowable matters, or to be a minimum rates awards. Indeed, the intention in moving the new ground 170MW(6A) for paid rates employees is to ensure that they continue to have access to paid rates arrangements, as made clear in paragraph 2.18 of the signed Government/Democrat amendments. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These provisions will ensure that the unequal bargaining relationship for government workers faced with the full legal, political and financial might of a Government employer cannot be used to force them into sub-standard agreements. The access to arbitration of paid rates awards is a vital protection for such employees to ensure that consistent and comprehensive conditions of employment are available right across the area of employment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be pointed out that these provisions are not limited to Government employment, but extent to any categories of employees who, prior to the commencement of this section, were the kind of employees customarily covered by paid rates awards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The criteria for access to arbitration in 170MW(6A) are not as tough as the "special case" provisions that currently exist. These provisions represent an important protection and a real advance for paid rates employees. I commend them to the Senate.</PARA>

This provision will be retained and expanded under proposed section 358A as amended by amendment 141. Given the reports cost about $500,000 a year to produce, we think it is reasonable that they move to biennial reporting now that base of data has been established. As such, we can see little need for a report in 1996, as the year will be under two different reform acts.</PARA>

<PARA>I am now asking the chamber to consider our amendment 15 on sheet 217 which originally <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> stood as amendment 43. This amendment inserts new proposed sections 170LRA, 170LRB and 170LRC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Proposed section 170LRA deals with the right to bargain collectively and ensures that Australia's international obligations to encourage and promote collective bargaining is translated into a substantive provision. This is achieved first by ensuring that employees have the right to collectively bargain and to have their organisations represent them in the bargaining process. Secondly, employees are assured that they cannot be required to bargain individually if they prefer to bargain collectively through their organisation. Finally, an organisation of employees is deemed to represent their members unless a contrary intention appears.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Section 170LRB places a positive obligation upon an employer to notify a union with coverage if they wish to negotiate an Australian workplace agreement or certified agreement. Without this provision, the range of bargaining options available to the potential parties are not fully explored. Section 170LRC ensures that an employer cannot discriminate against an employee who prefers to bargain collectively. Without this provision, collective bargaining is a process entirely at the discretion of the employer. It would become, in many circumstances, a case of `take the individual contract on my terms, or no job'. Already state governments like Victoria and various employers like CRA have adopted such an approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Special full benches of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission have spelt out that the legislation is based on the need for collective bargaining with the elevation of individual agreement making and a substantial rewriting of the act. This needs to be expressly stated right now or it could be lost in totality. In short, you have the right to support. If you choose not to have support, that is your right as well. It is extremely difficult for many people in many workplaces in Australia to ensure that right to gain support. So we think it should be there as part of Australia's obligation and, obviously, it is the right of employees to choose not to utilise that support.</PARA>

<PARA>This amendment adds a new clause immediately after the anti-discrimination clause in the section relating to when the commission is to refuse to certify an agreement. This new clause specifically states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . provisions relating to discrimination must include provisions to prevent and eliminate discrimination against people on the basis of their sexuality or transgender identity, including provisions to provide non-discriminatory access to parental leave and carer's leave.</PARA>
<PARA>It is outrageous that as we head towards the year 2000, lesbians, gay men and people with a transgender identity are still discriminated against in the workplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the key aspects of this discrimination relates to employment conditions, such as compassionate and bereavement leave, parental leave, carer's leave and superannuation and workers compensation benefits. This amendment addresses two of these crucial areas as a means of raising the need for addressing these issues in industrial relations law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that discrimination is happening now and will continue to happen until we address these issues of discrimination. Lesbians, gays and transgenders are not asking for special rights; they are asking for equal rights. I would like honourable senators to put themselves in the position of a gay or lesbian worker whose long&hyphen;term partner becomes serious ill and requires home care. Can you imagine the anger and frustration when leave to care for that partner is denied because there is no recognition of the relationship, when a fellow worker who may have been married for only a matter of weeks or months is unquestionably granted such leave. I am not saying that they should not be granted leave; I am saying that this is not a special exemption for a minority group but a question of basic human rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had a request for an interview on this particular section on Western Australian radio. At the end of some questions and answers the interviewer, Liam Bartlett, said, `Don't you think this is a bit odd for a Green senator to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5483"> be moving this, you know?' I said, `Excuse me? Could you explain what you mean?' He said, `For a Green senator to be involved with gay and lesbian issues and transgender identity.' I said, `Isn't it interesting that you haven't asked me why the Greens are involved with industrial relations?' He assumed that Greens senators only deal with the environment, but he did not assume that it was odd that we should be involved in basic human rights or basic participatory democracy issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I then explained that the four pillars of green politics are environmental sustainability, human rights, participatory democracy and peace and disarmament. There was no question as to why we are involved in industrial relations. Perhaps they understood that over the years we have been involved in those issues, but the funny thing is he said that it is odd that we should be involved in fighting for basic human rights for people in the workplace. I thought the question was odd but at least I detected an embarrassed silence&mdash;that is what I would like to think&mdash;as a result of that response.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you were a person who had gone through the process of changing your gender identity and you had children, why should you be picked out from amongst all the workers in your workplace as the one person who is not allowed carers leave, whether it is for children or for a partner? Why should you be picked out as a person who does not have a right when other people do? I commend this amendment to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA>This amendment inserts two new clauses, clause 170LWA and clause 170LWB after clause 170LW.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clause 170LWB ensures that the Australian Industrial Relations Commission has a broad capacity to accept undertakings to rectify disadvantage in circumstances where such action is warranted.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make some comments and then incorporate some further comments on this schedule. As in the case of the certified agreement schedule, I will again table for incorporation in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  a detailed document explaining the opposition's response to the various government&hyphen;Democrat and Green amendments and detailing our own amendments on schedule 11.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In these brief comments, I would like to focus primarily on the substance of the government&hyphen;Democrat deal in relation to AWAs. At the outset, I should say that the opposition recognises that the amendments to be introduced as part of this deal do represent an improvement on the bill as it was originally drafted. In particular, the introduction of the pre&hyphen;agreement review is welcomed. So too is the application of a no disadvantage test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For this reason, we will vote in support of those amendments that give effect to the deal. But it should not be thought for one moment that the opposition believes these amendments go far enough. Far from it, we believe the bill, as amended, will still have some significant flaws. I just want to highlight some of the more important ones. First and foremost, we are disappointed that the bill will still allow AWAs to be entered into before employment commences. Blind Freddy can see that this creates the potential for AWAs to be offered to prospective employees as a condition of employment. In fact, not only could blind Freddy see this; so could Senator Murray. In his Senate report at page 342, he had this to say:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats endorse the views of the Majority report that the ability to enter into individual AWAs with new and prospective employees is a matter of concern.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course it is, Senator Murray. And, as you know, it is a concern because prospective employees in a weak bargaining period will have no choice but to accept the AWA. How can they possibly be expected to stoically insist on commencing employment on an agreement or under the award? It is this more than anything that will open the floodgates to a wave of individual contracts in the work force; this more than anything will see the downfall of collective bargaining.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, I remind Senator Murray that, in one of his recommendations in his Senate report on page 339, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is recommended that the bill seek to expressly encourage collective over individual bargaining, but allow for individual bargaining of AWAs where the conditions of the AWA as a whole are superior to the award, and that the employee genuinely and freely agrees to the AWA.</PARA>
<PARA>Anyone who believes that an employee who accepts an AWA as a condition of employment `genuinely and freely agrees' to it is showing his naivety. No&hyphen;one could ever accuse Mr Reith of this. He knows all too well the effects of this provision. Little wonder that he must have pressed very hard for its retention. It is a pity that the Democrats have wilted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition is also very disappointed that the review of AWAs will largely be carried out by the Employment Advocate and not by the commission. Worse still, the process will be a bureaucratic one conducted in secret without knowledge or intervention by unions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was, of course, one of the issues on which the Democrats have some form. Their pre&hyphen;election form was certainly impressive. They said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission must maintain a central role in vetting all enterprise agreements. Its powers to review enterprise agreements should if anything, be increased, to ensure the balance between work and family does not further decline.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The small business Employment Advocate would complement, but not replace, the AIRC and all <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5494"> agreements would still need to be ratified by the AIRC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We support unions having the right to be heard on matters before the AIRC which have the potential to impact on their members, including test cases and the registration of enterprise agreements with significant flow&hyphen;on potential.</PARA>
<PARA>The Democrats' Senate report form was also impressive. At page 340, Senator Murray said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats endorse the recommendation of the Majority Report that AWAs must be vetted by the AIRC before approval.</PARA>
<PARA>Now it seems that the Democrats have been nobbled. The minister has been slipping downers into the numerous cups of coffee that he must have proffered to the Democrats during their negotiations&mdash;</PARA>

The amended Bill is deficient in the case of new employees by providing that an AWA has no effect before a filing receipt is issued. This means that an AWA can become effective before it is approved by the Employment Advocate, in which case the new employee must bring civil court proceedings in order to recover any subsequently discovered shortfalls in entitlements. This is a entirely unfair position for new employees. It can only be addressed by ensuring that an AWA cannot become effective at least until the approval process is complete.</PARA>

This amendment amends the heading to label these agreements "Common document AWAs" and deletes reference to agreements being negotiated collectively. These changes more accurately reflect the true nature of these AWAs. It stresses that they are not collective instruments and are not the outcome of collective bargaining. AWAs are intrinsically individual contracts, and this should not be camouflaged by reference to collective terminology.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill provides that an AWA may be made before the commencement of employment. This amendment deletes this. As has already been stated the proposal to permit employees to enter into AWAs before employment commences creates the potential for AWAs to be proffered on a "take it or leave it" basis. This will permit pressure to be applied to vulnerable employees seeking work to accept lower wages and conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment also inserts a new provision which requires the employer or employee to file the AWA with the Commission and to make an application for approval by the Commission within 21 days of the AWA being made. This provides the procedural mechanism to give effect to pre&hyphen;agreement review of AWAs by the Commission.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment inserts new provisions headed "Requirements for AWAs". It provides that the Commission must subject AWAs to public review for the purposes of approving or not approving them. It provides that an AWA must not, in relation <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5496"> to the terms and conditions of employment, disadvantage the subject employee. This means an AWA cannot be approved if:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">i.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> there is a reduction in the employees' entitlements and protections under any applicable Federal award (including any award the Commission determines is appropriate for establishing the entitlements and protections of the employee), certified agreement or State award or under any Federal or State law; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ii.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> that reduction is contrary to the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment also provides that the Commission must also be satisfied that the employee has genuinely made the AWA. Further, the Commission must not approve the AWA if the employer has breached, or caused a breach, of the right to bargain collectively or of the prohibition on discrimination against collective bargaining (see Opp (201)). The Commission also must not approve the AWA if it discriminates on any ground, and in particular, if after 22 June 1997 it discriminates by providing for junior rates of pay.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition is moving this amendment because it believes there is an overwhelming case for independent review of AWAs by the Commission before they come into force. This is the only effective way to ensure that employees, particularly the more vulnerable, have genuinely made the agreement (free from any coercion) and have been provided with the requisite terms and conditions of employment. The Commission is best&hyphen;suited to this task. It has the knowledge and experience to properly assess the AWA. Further, because the Commission (as we have seen) plays the reviewing role in the case of certified agreements and applies the same `no disadvantage test', it makes sense to give the same body the task reviewing role in the case of AWAs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As to the requirement that the AWA be genuinely made, it is important that the Commission consider and determine this to ensure the AWA is not the product of, for eg, threats, failures to inform etc. In relation to the required non&hyphen;approval for breach of the various prohibitions the Opposition believes this is the most effective means of giving effect to these prohibitions (ie ensuring that an agreement which was entered into in breach of the prohibitions will never be effective). As to junior wage rates, these should not be introduced into AWAs for the same reasons&mdash;already sated&mdash;that they should be removed from certified agreements.</PARA>

The Opposition moves this amendment because the arguments in support of review of AWAs in the first instance apply equally to variations to AWAs.

The Commission should be entitled to exercise a public interest discretion in deciding whether to approve termination of an AWA. Termination may cause drastic consequences for the employee (if there is no new agreement and the employee will return to basic award entitlements) and so the Commission should be entitled to hear why these consequences are being agreed to, and if it thinks necessary, prevent these consequences from occurring. The proposal to permit unilaterally termination after the expiry date is very unfair as it gives the employer disproportionate bargaining power. It will enable an employer to threaten the employee with significant reductions to existing entitlements (ie back to the basic award entitlements) if he or she doesn't agree to proposals for a new agreement by the time of expiry of the old agreement.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment provides that an AWA or ancillary document has no effect before it has been filed (with the Commission), reviewed and approved by the Commission. The amended Bill is deficient in the case of new employees by providing that an AWA has no effect before a filing receipt is issued. This means that an AWA can become effective before it is approved by the Employment Advocate, in which case the new employee must bring civil court proceedings in order to recover any subsequently discovered shortfalls in entitlements. This is a entirely unfair position for new employees. It can only be addressed by ensuring that an AWA cannot become effective at least until the approval process is complete. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a section headed "Collective AWAs" it is provided that 2 or more agreements negotiated collectively can be included in the one document if the one employer is a party. This amendment amends the heading to label these agreements "Common document AWAs" and deletes reference to agreements being negotiated collectively. These changes more accurately reflect the true nature of these AWAs. It stresses that they are not collective instruments and are not the outcome of collective bargaining. AWAs are intrinsically individual contracts, and this should not be camouflaged by reference to collective terminology.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill provides that an AWA may be made before the commencement of employment. This amendment deletes this. As has already been stated the proposal to permit employees to enter into AWAs before employment commences creates the potential for AWAs to be proffered on a "take it or leave it" basis. This will permit pressure to be applied to vulnerable employees seeking work to accept lower wages and conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment also inserts a new provision which requires the employer or employee to file the AWA with the Commission and to make an application for approval by the Commission within 21 days of the AWA being made. This provides the procedural mechanism to give effect to pre&hyphen;agreement review of AWAs by the Commission.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment inserts new provisions headed "Requirements for AWAs". It provides that the Commission must subject AWAs to public review for the purposes of approving or not approving them. It provides that an AWA must not, in relation to the terms and conditions of employment, disadvantage the subject employee. This means an AWA cannot be approved if:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">i.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> there is a reduction in the employees' entitlements and protections under any applicable Federal award (including any award the Commission determines is appropriate for establishing the entitlements and protections of the employee), certified agreement or State award or under any Federal or State law; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ii.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> that reduction is contrary to the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment also provides that the Commission must also be satisfied that the employee has genuinely made the AWA. Further, the Commission must not approve the AWA if the employer has breached, or caused a breach, of the right to bargain collectively or of the prohibition on discrimination against collective bargaining (see Opp (201)). The Commission also must not approve the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5502"> AWA if it discriminates on any ground, and in particular, if after 22 June 1997 it discriminates by providing for junior rates of pay.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition is moving this amendment because it believes there is an overwhelming case for independent review of AWAs by the Commission before they come into force. This is the only effective way to ensure that employees, particularly the more vulnerable, have genuinely made the agreement (free from any coercion) and have been provided with the requisite terms and conditions of employment. The Commission is best&hyphen;suited to this task. It has the knowledge and experience to properly assess the AWA. Further, because the Commission (as we have seen) plays the reviewing role in the case of certified agreements and applies the same `no disadvantage test', it makes sense to give the same body the task reviewing role in the case of AWAs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As to the requirement that the AWA be genuinely made, it is important that the Commission consider and determine this to ensure the AWA is not the product of, for eg, threats, failures to inform etc. In relation to the required non&hyphen;approval for breach of the various prohibitions the Opposition believes this is the most effective means of giving effect to these prohibitions (ie ensuring that an agreement which was entered into in breach of the prohibitions will never be effective). As to junior wage rates, these should not be introduced into AWAs for the same reasons&mdash;already sated&mdash;that they should be removed from certified agreements.</PARA>

The Opposition moves this amendment because the arguments in support of review of AWAs in the first instance apply equally to variations to AWAs.

The Commission should be entitled to exercise a public interest discretion in deciding whether to approve termination of an AWA. Termination may cause drastic consequences for the employee (if there is no new agreement and the employee will return to basic award entitlements) and so the Commission should be entitled to hear why these consequences are being agreed to, and if it thinks necessary, prevent these consequences from occurring. The proposal to permit unilaterally termination after the expiry date is very unfair as it gives the employer disproportionate bargaining power. It will enable an employer to threaten the employee with significant reductions to existing entitlements (ie back to the basic award entitlements) if he or she doesn't agree to proposals for a new agreement by the time of expiry of the old agreement.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is curious that there is agreement in the original bill and the government&hyphen;Democrat amendment in regard to section 170VF to categorise a non&hyphen;employee as an employee for the purpose of making an agreement about employment. Essentially, that is the position that is being put. There is no way that that position could be justified under what is generally termed the industrial relations power of the constitution, because there is no way that, prior to actual engagement, there is an employee&hyphen;employer relationship. Therefore, there is no way that the High Court would have allowed an agreement made under the constitutional power&mdash;which I will term industrial relations&mdash;for that to succeed. Obviously, the qualification of the provision for the making of AWAs in section 170VC is designed to get at this contrived arrangement through every other constitutional means possible than the industrial relations power. I <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5515"> suppose that subject to, at some stage, some legislation being passed in the Victorian parliament, there will be an amendment to section 170VC or some other legislation to permit the general application of this provision to employees in Victoria, given the statement by the Premier of Victoria, Mr Kennett, with regard to handing over that state's industrial relations power to the Commonwealth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is extremely interesting that this arrangement is being arrived at by constitutional means that are not the traditional constitutional basis of the industrial relations legislation of the Commonwealth. I would have to concede that it is not the first time that that has occurred. But in this case I think the only way it is possible for this to be a legitimate prescription is by means of other constitutional provisions than what I will term the industrial relations provision&mdash;the power of the Commonwealth in relation to conciliation and arbitration to prevent and settle industrial disputes. Of course, on many occasions the High Court has held that you cannot have an industrial dispute unless there is an employer&hyphen;employee relationship. It is just impossible to imagine the circumstances in which the High Court would find that prior to actual engagement such circumstances existed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are trying to get through this bill rather expeditiously in the committee stage at the moment, so there is not much point in my going to the particular High Court tests which I think would justify the statement that I have made. What we have is a provision which I would suggest is contrived to justify what we would say is not justifiable: that is, to say that prior to an employee being in any bargaining position at all, the employee can enter into an agreement&mdash;no doubt proffered by the employer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The employee has no bargaining power if they want the job, unless they are in a very special skills situation, so we are talking about the majority of employees in this country. Young people and casuals are all being placed in the situation of having no bargaining power at all when they change jobs. I believe that this particular provision in the legislation is a particularly unfortunate <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and even immoral provision in relation to the so&hyphen;called questions of choice that this government is pursuing with this legislation. Choice in this case will be the choice of the employer only.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats' position is that such agreements can be made prior to entering into the employment relationship, provided the matter is dealt with by the industrial commission rather than just by the Employment Advocate. I suppose there is a rationale which suggests that at least there is a further testing of the arrangement to ensure that what arises out of the agreement is something which satisfies the minimum conditions test. What that does not satisfy is the question of a freely reached agreement&mdash;a genuine agreement. A genuine agreement is reached between bargaining equals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation now establishes provisions for an agreement to be made between unequal parties in unfair circumstances and circumstances which will be prejudicial to many employees, young and old, whose particular skills do not give them enhanced bargaining power. The opposition amendments would delete that peculiar provision which, although it has been changed by the government&hyphen;Democrat amendment 134, retains the position of pre-employment agreement by employees. The Labor Party amendment removes this but requires that the AWA be filed with the commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the way that agreements are dealt with, I indicated in the second reading stage the difficulty with allowing a test of agreements simply by a member of the Public Service employed under the Public Service Act 1922. There is the question of training, the level at which the employee is engaged within service and, therefore, their level of skill and responsibility. We are looking at a fairly significant test, a test that relates to one of the most fundamental contracts which any person makes and which almost every person in this country, if they make no other agreement, makes to enter into an employment relationship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why I think this is fundamentally flawed legislation. The amendment now <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5516"> before the committee ought to have the support of thinking members of this chamber. Although I do not expect that the Democrats will waver from the agreement, I think they will regret the fact that they have entered into an agreement which establishes such prejudicial conditions for employees, for potential employees, for the disadvantaged and for the powerless within the working community.</PARA></SPEECH>

What has been achieved as a result of this deal is that, instead of a three&hyphen;year reporting period, we will have a two&hyphen;year reporting period. More importantly, this will mean that there will be only one report before the next election.</PARA>

We believe that the reporting process ensures that a close eye is kept on the industrial reform process and its effect on disadvantaged workers.

<PARA>I would like to make a few remarks on this schedule. There is only one principal issue I wish to address. I and my colleagues have previously addressed the rest or it will be covered in the document I will incorporate. The issue I want to address is one that is vitally important for the future of the country&mdash;arrangements for trainees and apprentices. Everyone should understand that, regrettably, trainees and apprentices have been sold out by these provisions. This is confirmed by the amendments which the Democrats have agreed to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to see that the government and Democrats amendments have made special provision for trainees and apprentices. Trainees and apprentices will be delighted to know that they are to be treated differently; they will not be so delighted when they learn that they are being treated worse. For everyone else, the new no disadvantage test will effectively ensure their take-home pay cannot be reduced under a workplace agreement. Not so for trainees and apprentices. Their guarantee is that their award wage rate cannot be reduced under a workplace agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does this mean in practical terms? Trainees and apprentices in the future may, under a workplace agreement, be paid only for the hours spent in productive employment. Any time spent in training, whether on the job or not, can be regarded as unproductive. Trainees and apprentices will not be paid for this time. In other words, trainees and apprentices can have their take&hyphen;home pay cut under these provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a clear and unambiguous breach by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) of the rock solid guarantee that no worker would be <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> worse off under this industrial relations policy. If you are a trainee or an apprentice, there is no doubt that you can be worse off. This regrettably does not surprise me, given that the government has been in the business of redefining its election promises as core and non-core commitments. I can only assume that the government's election commitment that the take&hyphen;home pay of trainees and apprentices would not be cut is now regarded as a non-core promise. It is regrettable and a great pity that Mr Howard did not tell this to kids on traineeships and apprenticeships before the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What staggers me is the Democrats say they will support this breach of promise. I am reminded&mdash;I do not like to be&mdash;of Senator Stott Despoja's plaintive speech in the second reading debate on the subject. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Only paying young people for the time they spend in productive work as opposed to training means that in many cases wages under MAATS will be lower than they are currently.</PARA>
<PARA>She certainly got that part right. She went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has promised that it will pay a top&hyphen;up . . . to young people who undertake the MAATS apprenticeships and traineeships, but I am yet to be convinced that this payment will go anywhere near towards providing young people with the means to sustain a reasonable living standard.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>I can only assume that the Senate has now been convinced because, if one thing is for certain, the Democrats have agreed to a provision that will cut wages for trainees and apprentices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Stott Despoja showed in her speech in the second reading debate that a metal trades apprentice with one year's training could lose $34 per week in take&hyphen;home pay under these proposals. The opposition has demonstrated that a second year, 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;old metal trades apprentice could lose as much as $70 per week in take&hyphen;home pay under these proposals. Senator Stott Despoja cannot have it both ways. She cannot come into the chamber criticising the inadequacies of government proposals only to vote for them. She certainly cannot wander around the country claiming she represents the interests <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5530"> of young people only to come into this chamber and vote against those interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are moving amendments that repeal the provisions which allow trainee and apprenticeship wages to be cut. We want the same no disadvantage test to apply to them as applies to everyone else. I firmly believe that, if the Democrats can only vote with us on one amendment, this is it. Trainees and apprentices are too important to be sacrificed in the interests of this deal. I seek leave to incorporate some further comments in regard to this.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought there might have been a response to Senator Sherry's comments because this is a very important matter. These issues were fought for in the late 1950s and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> early 1960s, that is to say that training for apprentices, particularly by 1967 in any event, was recognised and paid for. A considerable amount of work was done at that stage. I can only speak from personal experience from 1959 onwards. I can certainly recall the discussions that took place over payment of apprentices for their time off either during the week or their block time off for training at tech schools. All of this was worked for and it was difficult.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation was that, obviously, trainees were gainfully employed or engaged in productive employment prior to then because they were training on the job, but new training techniques developed. As those new training techniques developed, employers required that training be absorbed by the apprentices by dint of time off for training. I do not think the block training system came in at that particular stage but it certainly came in not long after&mdash;I wish my memory was a bit clearer than it is tonight. At that particular stage, the apprentices were not about to lose pay as the trade union movement did not think they ought to be losing pay by reason of a demand by employers that they should be receiving training, and much of it block training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So now we have a situation whereby new skills and new ways of dealing with the training of apprentices will be required and it seems odd that, in such a situation where there will be further demand for apprentices, young apprentice technicians will be required to absorb more and more skills. They will be required to undertake education at times when they are not working on the job. It is very significant, I think, and regrettable that at this time we have what Senator Sherry has described, that is, a situation whereby we are being asked to treat those people differently. In other words, we are being asked to vote for a provision which will not give the apprentices and technical trainees that rock solid guarantee that their pay will not be cut.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Sherry said, it will be cut if the decision is made that they will only be paid for time spent in productive employment. I agree with what Senator Sherry said. This is a very crucial issue in this piece of legislation <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5531"> and I appeal to the committee to oppose the provision that the government and the Democrats are putting forward.</PARA></SPEECH>
<SPEECH PAGE="5531" TIME="8.52 p.m." SPEAKER="Murray, Sen Andrew" NAMEID="3M6" ELECTORATE="WA" PARTY="AD" GOV="0">

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3M6">Senator MURRAY</NAME>
<STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(8.52 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak about amendment 142 to schedule 13 of the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. This amendment does two things: first, it establishes the no disadvantage test for certified agreements and AWAs in preference to the government's originally proposed seven minimum conditions; and, second, it outlines special case conditions for persons engaged in apprenticeships and traineeships.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The no disadvantage test will seek to determine where the terms and conditions of employment of an agreement would result on balance in a reduction of the overall terms and conditions of employment of employees under the relevant awards and any other Commonwealth or state law. The establishment of the no disadvantage test is, in our view, a major advance on the original seven minimum conditions proposed by the government. The test does not just provide a broad protection in comparison to the entire award for unions and employees but also provides a higher level of flexibility for employers in packaging the overall mix of employment conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to speak briefly on sections 170XC and 170XD&mdash;the special cases in relation to employees undertaking traineeships and apprenticeships. It is a hard choice at times to identify which provisions of this bill have been most misrepresented by the ALP, but I think these sections would be a close favourite. Let us start with the argument that this will lead to a 20 per cent reduction in apprentices' wages because current award rates will be discounted for non-productive time. This is clearly not the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Sections 170XC(1) and 170XD(3) make it quite clear that the special case exercise involves the approved training authority determining the amount of training time in the current apprenticeships or traineeships and setting this as the benchmark. The approved training authority is then required to determine what the proportion is in the new training arrangements and to establish a percent age between the two which then forms the discount for the wages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thus, for example, if the award provides for a second-year apprenticeship of $300 a week&mdash;and to get that you have to spend a day a week in training&mdash;the non-productive percentage is 20 per cent. If the apprentice then agrees to an AWA&mdash;and he has to agree&mdash;including an approved accelerated training regime of two days a week, the percentage becomes 40 per cent. That would mean that the apprentice's salary, instead of being $300 for four days work would be $225 for three days work. But he has to agree.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats have insisted on a number of additional protections for apprentices and trainees. In particular, we have included a new definition of an approved training authority in section 170X, which covers state training authorities that exercise approval powers in relation to traineeships or apprenticeships, industry training bodies or bodies which meet the criteria on disallowable regulations. This precludes the approval function being given to local chambers of commerce or employer groups as some have suggested.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The exchange of letters between the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, Dr Kemp, and Senator Kernot, which have been read into the transcript, make it clear that apprenticeships and traineeships will be approved only if they comply with the national training framework and lead to a nationally recognised accreditation. The letter also restates the government's commitment to move towards a competency based&mdash;not an aged based&mdash;wage system for trainees and apprentices and, consistent with this, to offer a fourth $220 a week income support pay point, which the Democrats achieved in addition, for employees who have already completed the equivalent of AQF2&hyphen;level training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The no disadvantage test provides further protection for these workers in that an AWA or CA can only be approved if on balance it provides no reduction in award conditions. Section 83BB(2) will require the Employment Advocate to pay particular regard to the needs of trainees and apprentices in exercising their <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5532"> powers, including their powers of vetting and approval of AWAs. Combined, this is a tight package of protections which allows the flexibility of the government's MAATS apprenticeship system to get off the ground while ensuring that the system operates with the interests of trainees and apprentices at the forefront and adequately protected.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to schedule 14, which deals with the definition of industrial action, I will be making some detailed comments and will incorporate some further comments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The one issue that I want to address is the use of injunctions in industrial relations. One of the features of this bill is the increased use of injunctions in dealing with industrial disputes. We see it here in this schedule: injunctions to enforce commission orders; injunctions against people paying strike pay; and, later, when we deal with secondary boycotts, we will find injunctions being introduced to enforce the most draconian provisions in this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem is that injunctions in the industrial relations context are a very blunt instrument. They can be awarded without the court giving any consideration to the merits of the dispute. They do not act to resolve the dispute but merely to stamp out its manifestations. Injunctions also expose unions and unionists to great jeopardy. Breach of an injunction is a serious matter and can expose the union or unionist to unlimited financial penalties for contempt of court.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5533">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government knows all this. That is why they are making injunctions available, and in far wider circumstances. What is extraordinary is that the Democrats also understand this. Senator Murray in his report said at page 360:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The use of injunctions against workers and unions is a very blunt and effective `weapon' in the armoury of employers.</PARA>
<PARA>Why then, Senator Murray, do you facilitate them? Why be a party to increasing their use in industrial relations? I can remember Senator Murray in Melbourne during the Senate committee hearings telling the members of the International Centre for Trade Union Rights that he understood the inherent problems in ex parte injunctions&mdash;he did not even need their advice at that stage. Now he is going to vote in favour of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We want to do something about injunctions in this schedule. If we cannot delete the injunction power, we at least want to modify it to considerably reduce its destructive potential against unions and their members. Our amendments propose two things. Firstly, we propose that an injunction, whether interim or final, cannot be granted in the absence of the other party unless the court is satisfied that the applicant has been given notice of the application to the other person. This ensures that an employer cannot rush off to the court behind the union's back to get an interim injunction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, we propose that an interim injunction cannot be granted unless the court is satisfied that, first, the applicant is likely to succeed at the trial of the action and that, second, not granting the injunction will inevitably expose the applicant to loss or harm for which an award of damages is a wholly inadequate remedy. These strict requirements before an interim injunction will be ordered will at least ensure that the merits of the dispute will be heard by the court before an injunction will be ordered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats know and understand that these amendments are modest, but will remove the worst excesses on injunctions in industrial relations. They should act on the basis of their knowledge and vote in support of these amendments. I move:</PARA>

The Opposition moves this amendment because the requirement that the risk be imminent is onerous and unnecessary, especially in such an important area as health and safety.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SCHEDULE 14 (AMENDMENTS 143-145):</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I seek leave to move these amendments together.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendment 143 is a small evidentiary change to section 127 to require the Commission to hear and determine applications for directions orders as quickly as possible. While it is expected that use of section 127 directions will be few and far between, and that the Commission has an absolute discretion not to grant such relief, the amendment recognises that where inappropriate industrial action <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is causing significant damage, then obviously there must be a duty clearly on the Commission to act quickly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats will support the amended section 127 because we believe that it is incumbent on defenders of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to ensure that the Commission as the powers to enforce its orders. The current procedures of fines and bans clauses simply has not been effective and it is not unusual to find unions defying orders and recommendations of the Commission. As a result, the Commission has at times become almost reluctant to make an order or recommendation that it knows will be ignored. We believe that if the unions wish to have broader access to arbitration in the Commission, the quid pro quo must be that they respect the Commission and its decisions. And section 127, with directions orders, and with access to injunctions if those directions orders are defied, is, in our view an appropriate means of achieving that.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provisions are very similar to the provision of the draft Industrial Relations Bill put up by Labor in 1987, in turn based on recommendation of the comprehensive Hancock Inquiry, but was subsequently withdrawn under represser from the union movement in 1988. I commend the provisions to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments 144 and 145 re-instate section 166A into the Industrial Relations Act. This section provides for a compulsory period of conciliation to a maximum of 72 days before an employer can commence common law action against a union or employee in relation to a dispute. The provision reflects the current act, but with a few technical changes to ensure that unions do not engage in stop-start action to legally avoid the provisions, and to make it clear that it also contains a provision making it clear that action in breach of a direction of a State industrial authority is not protected by the section.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Combined with the exclusion of primary boycotts from the Trade Practices Act, other than the narrow category of primary boycotts involving the movement of goods in and out of Australia, this provision will ensure that primary boycotts are dealt with in a very similar way to how they are now by the AIRC, with the added enforcement provisions by the directions orders process.</PARA>

<PARA>It is quite a difficult debate to be involved with sometimes tonight, because if people have incorporated comments about entire areas, including Greens (WA) amendments, there may well be comments that have been made about my amendments which I will not have had the opportunity to know about or respond to. That is something I would like put on the record tonight. It should be noted that, in the outcome, if there are comments about what we have done or said, it makes it extremely difficult and very unfair if those comments are incorporated without anybody having a chance to respond to the particular issues that we are putting up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, amendments Nos 77 and 78 amend the clause on payments in relation to periods of industrial action to avoid a potentially outrageous implication. It is possible&mdash;I am sure this was purely unintentional&mdash;that, as the clause currently stands, an employer must not make a payment to a worker who is engaged in industrial action, such as a work to rules campaign or a ban on administering dole diaries, which is a contemporary example. It might also include employees engaged in a campaign of, as we mentioned before in relation to workers' health and safety, avoiding a dangerous situation or <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5538"> unsafe industrial equipment that their employer is failing to acknowledge. It could be a case of supporting another employee who is in that situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These two amendments seek to limit the definition of industrial action for the purposes of the new part VIIIA. If these changes are not made, employers would have the capacity, and probably the requirement, to avoid their obligations to pay employees for industrial action, such as work to rule arrangements, even though the employees were gainfully, productively and fully employed. The current definition of industrial action applies to a wide range of action. The idea that workers could be not just made but prohibited under the law from receiving payment in circumstances where their action falls short of the withdrawal of labour is fundamentally inequitable and unjust. The bill as currently structured actually prohibits an employer from paying an employee for any period of industrial action, regardless of its nature or effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These amendments would not be necessary if the new part VIIIA, which deals with payments in relation to periods of industrial action, was not inserted into the legislation. The government is using a pre&hyphen;existing broad definition of industrial action, which was inserted to increase the commission's powers to intervene in a wide range of disputes, to pervert the intention of that original use. The concept is perverted in this new part VIIIA by ensuring that workers must be docked pay even when the industrial action being undertaken not only is short of strike action but, in many cases, causes little or no damage to the employer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure that, now this unintended consequence has been drawn to their attention, the government and the Democrats will support this very sensible redraft of the clause. I looked for the definition, and it is under the existing definition of industrial relations. Before I sit down, I would like to clarify with the parliamentary secretary whether his interpretation of industrial action does include work to rules campaigns.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DX5">Senator MARGETTS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Therefore, industrial action involving dole diaries and situa <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> tions where workers may be asked to do work that is patently impossible or for which they have not been trained, for which the technology is unsuitable or for which there is no getting through to the person who is giving those orders, will mean that employees will have to have their pay docked. This will occur even if what they are being asked to do is stupid and if there has been no other way of getting through to the employer that the employees have been asked to do a dumb thing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many examples where work to rules campaigns or even some other minor industrial action has brought about beneficial changes in the workplace. Perhaps people think that, if they are going to be killed for a sheep, they might as well be killed for a lamb. That means that, instead of taking sensible, low key industrial action, they may well choose to take strike action. That is what it says. You get the same penalty for strike action; you get your pay docked as you would for limited industrial action. It says `must'. It does not say `may'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wonder whether the spokesperson for the Democrats might comment on the points that Senator Margetts has brought up. I will re-encapsulate it. People in the workplace who invoke a work to rules campaign because of a matter that is very serious to them may have their pay docked because of it. Senator Margetts points out that it is not a case of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5539"> may; the employer must dock them pay for taking part in industrial action on those grounds. That is incredible and quite unbelievable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will talk a little longer to allow Senator Murray to consult with the government, as he is doing at the moment. It would be remarkable to hear, from what I know of the Democrats' excellent commitment to social justice, that the right of people in whatever circumstances to stand up for something that is going patently wrong in the community without being penalised for it is being eroded by a law that says they must be penalised. This proposed section says that if there is a work to rules campaign, the employees must be penalised by the employer. What a remarkable situation. The disputants would not go to court and have a hearing at which the matter would be adjudicated. The law says that employees who take part in such an action must be penalised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think Senator Margetts deserves to have a response. She has got none from the government, except to say, `Yes, that's the case.' Senator Margetts deserves to have a clearer response from the Democrats, who support this motion, as to how they could possibly be doing so; how they could possibly be supporting summary penalties for people in the workplace who take part in a work to rules campaign over a matter like the dole diary. I would presume that silence means there is no explanation&mdash;that the inexplicable is being supported by the Democrats on this matter.</PARA></SPEECH>

But it is open to any senator&mdash;not that I encourage it&mdash;who has fears about something in a document to refuse leave for it to be incorporated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a matter of course and through the courtesy shown to me, particularly by Senator Sherry, I have checked all the documents that he has sought leave to incorporate. That remains open to any senator. Certainly, if Senator Sherry had made any remarks in those incorporated documents that I wanted to respond to, I would have done so. That remains open to any senator to do. So I think it is not a fear that you need to have, because you can refuse leave or you can do what I am doing&mdash;that is, check any documents prior to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the substantive issues, the government opposes amendments 77 and 78 that apply to item 9. The amendments appear to be based on what we see as a misunderstanding of the relevant provisions of the bill. It is not clear what the amendments are intended to achieve. They apply to item 9 of the schedule, which seeks to insert new provisions prohibiting the payment or acceptance of strike pay, that is, payments for periods when the employees concerned were engaged in industrial action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have asked me on a couple of occasions what our definitions of industrial action are. On the face of it, your amendments would have the result that the prohibition would not apply to industrial action falling short of a complete stoppage of work but it would apply to action which is excluded from the statutory definition of industrial action. It would apply to action which was authorised or agreed to by the employer and to action which was based on a reasonable concern about an imminent risk to health and safety.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the amendments are intended to ensure that the prohibition on strike pay does not <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5540"> apply to action which is excluded from the definition of industrial action, they are therefore unnecessary. That is already the effect of this bill. To the extent that the amendments seek to exclude from the prohibition on strike pay industrial action which falls short of a full stoppage of work, the government does not accept them. Bans and limitations on work leading right up to a definition of industrial action can be just as costly and disruptive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To summarise the point that I have just read into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, there are already exclusions in relation to those matters. If they are your concern, then you need have no concern.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the point that the parliamentary secretary just made is fairly telling. He said `can be' just as disruptive and just as costly. This part of the bill leaves no discretion to the employer. The employer may actually think in hindsight that the action was quite reasonable. They might come to their senses if they were doing something that might actually cost them money in the long run. They might not be listening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly this applies to a number of safety issues. I have mentioned before that under section 14(2) there are very great limitations in relation to industrial action over workers health and safety issues. We have had that debate already. It is very limiting to an individual who is feeling under imminent threat. Also, that person can be moved on to another job. Therefore, even that small area is not already covered in the bill. There are lots of other areas which are not covered under the scope of industrial action in the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think you have actually clearly said what the rationale is, except to say that industrial action and even work to rules can be just as costly. But you did not say it must be, and you still have not explained it. I will be very happy to hear you explain.</PARA>

We will not have an improved workplace but a workplace of fear and at times exploitation. If, by the end of the week, you do have not quite enough money to pay your employee, I am sure you can trump up a few things you can require your work force  to do to which they will have to say, `I really cannot do that.'

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to respond to a point that Senator Margetts made. She has made it twice now. I guess you can generally win an argument if you build a straw man out of enough straw and dress it up with enough clothes to make it look like a real argument.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5542"> The reality of the argument is that the workplace environment that we are building is one that starts off being made on agree ment. What you are saying is that an employer will go and ask an employee who has negotiated a workplace agreement to do something that is unreasonable. Senator Margetts, you roll your eyes because again you look at industrial relations through the paradigm of having us and them&mdash;these nasty bosses and these nasty employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are nasty bosses out there. I am sure there are a hell of a lot of them. Senator Sherry, you and I will agree that that is not going to change the day after this bill passes into law. Of course it will not. If you want to achieve change as a nation, if you want to achieve change in industrial relations, you have to help build that new environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You would prefer to keep Australia in the old environment, not to change it, not to move forward to an environment where you actually build a regime which encourages more cooperation and more agreement. The reality here is that you agree between the employer and employee on all of those relationships and workplace matters and what you are saying is that that is irrelevant and that will never happen. You believe that could never happen because employers are all nasty and the employees are subjugated by these nasty employers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You would know from your own experience that that is not always the case. Things are changing and we hope this bill might change things more. However, if you build up a straw man and say that employers will direct people to do totally unreasonable things, the fact is they already have agreements in place as to what their terms of employment are, the sorts of tasks they will be undertaking&mdash;job descriptions and so forth.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think Senator Campbell's talk about a straw man needs a bit of testing. The example that comes to my mind with this provision and the amendment moved by Senator Margetts is the nursing profession. In the state of Tasmania the nursing profession <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in public hospitals are covered by federal awards. If they decide, because they do not want to disrupt patient care, that they do not want to do a certain amount of paperwork, then the Tasmanian government is directed by this legislation, if they can be, to withhold all payment for the entirety of the shift. That is what this provision is proposing to say.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know whether the government is seeking to impress upon groups like nurses, who do not want to take direct action but want to make an industrial point, that they have to either lose their pay and perform the work and make a token gesture, which will be pointless and have no effect on their employer, or alternatively say, `We'll go all the way.' You are saying to us, `If you do anything you don't get a penny.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just wonder whether this provision is going to push groups who might take a minor action to a point where they will say, `What the hell. We are going to lose pay. Why don't we take the action?' Or will it be teachers? A lot of the teaching profession are seeking coverage by federal awards. From time to time they take action. They say that they are not going to fill in term reports or the like. If they say that they are not going to fill in term reports, how long do you dock their pay&mdash;until they do it? Are you saying to teachers, `Well, you might as well go all the way?' But when you do that you come back to this question of orders to stop or prevent industrial action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is the agenda of the government with these amendments to come back and say, `We are going to force people to take action because we can injunct to stop it?' The culture of the amendments may be to remove the rights of many employees to take any form of industrial action in real terms. I think the Democrats ought to look very closely at this provision because I do not think they fully appreciate the impact that this will have on the industrial climate, particularly for groups who have traditionally been reluctant to take the absolute form of industrial action.</PARA></SPEECH>

We have to take from the silence so far on the matter that they have not understood the import of what this section means. As Senator O'Brien says, the workplace is going to be driven to greater industrial action by this section, not to lesser industrial action. You may as well be hung for a sheep than for a lamb. If you are going to lose your pay you might as well go out on strike as have a work to rule.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has not been thought through by the government, let alone the Democrats. This is a new period of workplace relationship in which the government says to the employer, `You must punish your employees.' No matter what your relationship with them is, if they invoke a work to rule campaign on a matter that is worrying them it will radically worsen relationships, not improve them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this goes through, employees in any workplace in Australia who take such action are going to be penalised. Without any reference to the courts or an adjudicator the employer must dock their pay. So they are immediately going to be facing penalties totally out of proportion to what they are doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question arises: what happens when an employer asks employees to do something which is illegal, which infringes upon workplace safety provisions or some other law providing for the protection of the wider society? I imagine the court is going to have the commonsense at the end of the day to make sure that the workers get back their pay. But in the meantime they are going to have to be docked. They are going to have to take a penalty. The employer is obliged, under this proposed section of this legislation, to impose that penalty or presumably that employer is going to be in breach of the law. What a remarkable set of circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to the Democrats: at least take this home and look at it again. Senator Margetts has brought up a matter of extraordinary importance to the workplace in Australia. This issue has not been canvassed in public. I doubt there is anybody out there in the Australian workplace who is aware of this particularly insidious proposed section of the law where the word `may'&mdash;bad as that might <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> be&mdash;has been replaced by the word `must'. An employer will be set against an employee by a government who have failed to see the full ramifications of what they are doing in this proposed section.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Anyway it is a very critical moment for reconsideration. There is a lot weighing on this. Again I thank the government for responding, as they have done on every occasion. Yes, it is black and white. It is very clear that what Senator Margetts has said is dead right. The matter is deadly serious. But there is still this silence from Senator Murray and the Democrat benches. It is a telling moment. It will be gone very shortly and it is a matter for prudence to be brought into place so that at least overnight consideration is given to the matter that Senator Margetts has brought before the chamber.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For all of the people who heard all of the evidence in this committee of inquiry, to suggest that you can put a provision in a bill on the basis that human nature will be terrific is ridiculous. We have to make legislation on the basis of how it might be misused.

There would have been no resort to the courts and no independent arbiter. They would have got a summary penalty on the spot.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am a little confused as to the response given by the parliamentary secretary when Senator Murray asked him about the effect of 187AD of the workplace relations bill. As far as I can see, it deals with the power of the court in respect of contraventions of sections 187AA or 187AB. But 187AA is not really relevant, because it requires the employer not to make a payment to an employee for a period in which the employee engages in industrial action, and then it qualifies that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Section 187AB, however, talks about `organisations not to take action for payments in relation to periods of industrial action'. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An organisation, or an officer, member or employee of an organisation, must not:</PARA>
<PARA>I cannot quite follow the response that was given by the parliamentary secretary to Senator Murray. I cannot see that his response gives any clarification to the matter that was raised by Senator Margetts initially.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I add another point. Given the point that the parliamentary secretary made in relation to a payment being withheld because of an employee refusing to obey an instruction to perform an illegal act, I ask: what about the case where an employee has a strong objection based on conscience at a particular time to the performance of a particular task? Is that not then requiring the employer to not make payment to the employee in respect of the exercise of that objection based on conscience?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point that I want to make relates to contracts that are entered into from time to time. I am not talking about AWAs; I am talking about contracts for the performance of a job. The clauses of a number of contracts contain a provision that requires the contractor to perform the tasks in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth or the state. Section 187AA(3) says `a contravention of subsection (1) or (2) is not an offence'. It  is not an offence under this, but the party to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the contract to receive the supply of goods could insist that a contractor who has made payment to an employee for a period in which the employee engages in industrial action had breached the provisions of the contract.

Even though I did very well in that particular unit, which involved torts and contracts, the advice I give you is worth exactly what you paid for it. The first point relates to the penalties and the flexibility in relation to 187AD.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5547"> Even though you said you raised only two points, you actually raised three which I think are important.

We would hope, in the event that an employee had strong conscientious beliefs in relation to various matters, that they would be matters that would be, particularly, in relation to performing tasks, functions or matters at work and would be things that could be the subject of discussion with their employer.

I really do not see that, when it relates to the requirement on the employer in respect an employee. Section 187AD relates, in effect, to the actions of the contravention of 187AA or 187AB. Contravention of 187AA is classically the payment by the employer to the employee. That is a contravention of 187AA. In 187AD it talks about contraventions of 187AB which relate to an organisation, an officer, a member or an employee of an organisation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I apologise if I confused you. I slightly confused myself because you raised three points. I set out to respond to two of them and, in responding to the third, I referred back to my first answer. I thought I had totally confused everyone in the chamber but I had not confused you enough. I actually said to the adviser, `I think that should just about confuse them all.' I am glad that I did not confuse you enough.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The principal point I was making in relation to conscientious objectors was that they should be matters that are worked out. I think it is fair to say that there may well be people with conscientious beliefs. I know when I first enrolled in university my conscientious belief was that I did not want to be a member of a student union. I had no alternative when I was a student but to belong to that union. Otherwise, I would not be given my grades or even <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a permit to park in the student car park. I had no outlet for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is possible in that circumstance that someone may enter into an agreement or a workplace relationship and that was not a matter of discussion when the workplace agreement came into place. It may well be that those conscientious beliefs were private matters that both the employee and the employer thought were outside that sort of negotiation and discussion. I think that is a very valid point you have raised, Senator Harradine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It may well be that an employer may ask an employee to do something that was outside their conscientious beliefs and that it was not the subject of an agreement. It is not impossible for me or the government to see that occurring, although we would hope that would not be the case. That is one example of a matter which should be kept under review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will keep these matters under review and we believe it will work effectively. But if the problems that you have raised in the debate do emerge, then the government will undertake to assess that and, if amendments to this section are required, of course we will bring them back here under that circumstance.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have just commenced schedule 15, registered organisations. There are a number of vitally important issues that I want to address on this schedule. The first is the proposed amendments in relation to union organisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two key aspects to which the opposition is strongly opposed. We are firmly opposed to the creation of enterprise unions. The problems they will create for the industrial relations system as a whole are manifest. The introduction of enterprise unions will lead to a multiplicity of unions, to the detriment of employers and the community as a whole. It will create federally registered unions which cannot be party to a federal award, thereby creating a gap in representation rights. It will permit the federal registration of a union which would traditionally, and indeed exclusively, be registered under state law. This will create a conflict between federal and state industrial relations systems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is achieved in return? We do not think anything. At worst, these enterprise unions will be nothing but bosses unions. At best, there must be severe doubts whether a union which is exclusively centred on one enterprise can, even assuming adequate funding, appropriately represent the interests of members better than an industrial union. And what of its funding base? How can a union with so few members and such an inadequate funding base properly represent its <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> members? We do not think it can and we believe that the government knows it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition is also firmly committed to opposing any changes to the existing `conveniently belong' rule. The Democrats did their best to prevent the repeal of the rule and they succeeded, but I must say that the compromise they have reached&mdash;as is often the case with compromises&mdash;does not improve their position and actually creates a provision which is so complicated that many industrial relations practitioners around Australia must be scratching their heads wondering what it all means.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The great tragedy is that the existing rules operated effectively to avoid what can be the harmful effects of union competition, including demarcation disputes and the problems associated with employers having to deal with a multiplicity of unions. I cannot recall at the committee hearings any employer support for the concept of competition between unions at a workplace brought about by the types of provisions proposed. In fact, I can recall only employer evidence that was supportive of the existing provisions in the existing act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes to the rule could lead to an increase in union conflicts as contests about effective representation develop. It is also extremely unfair that enterprise associations are exempted from the operation of the rule. There is no justification for this other than discrimination against organisations that are not enterprise organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second vital issue is the question of disamalgamation. The opposition's position on this issue is crystal clear. The opposition is concerned that the amalgamation proposals in this bill may create a multiplicity of unions. However, we accept the disamalgamation proposal in so far as it relates to the original preamalgamation constituent unions because we do not believe this parliament can prevent a union which has democratically amalgamated with another from democratically disamalgamating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5551"> But, as to that part of the disamalgamating proposal that permits constituent unions to further disamalgamate to their state branches, the rationale to which I have referred simply does not apply. Those individual state branch es did not individually elect to amalgamate and, therefore, there is no question of their individually electing to disamalgamate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third and final issue I wish to address is one that I have discussed before&mdash;right of entry. The opposition totally rejects the regulation of right of entry exclusively by a statutory scheme. The regulation of right of entry by the commission on a case-by-case basis is the only appropriate system because only it can take into account individual circumstances peculiar to particular employees or industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Health Services Union of Australia has pointed out a very important example to the opposition. Many of its members work as health care workers in residential nursing homes. The relevant award takes this into account and permits unions to access residential homes so that the union can look after the interests of its members. Yet this bill prohibits the entry of unions into premises used for residential purposes without the permission of the occupier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What happens to health care workers in residential nursing homes? There is effectively no right of entry. The opposition will move an amendment to remove this particular problem and I urge the Democrats to support it. They must realise that this is but one example of the practical problems which the statutory scheme has that they have signed up to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another example which I am sure will concern Senator Bourne&mdash;the problem of looking after the interests of outworkers. An effective right of entry provision requires entry not only to the place of outwork but also to the place from which the work is outsourced&mdash;that is where the records are and that is where the boss is. Under these provisions, unions have no right of entry to these places. We will move an amendment to address the problem and hope the Democrats will join with us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats have signed up to this statutory scheme. They should do everything they can to ameliorate its worst excesses, particularly the very important examples I have highlighted. To facilitate the speed of the debate, as I mentioned before, I seek to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> incorporate six pages of notes that go to the specific amendments.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GOVT/DEM 146 (OPPOS 301) </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats support this amendment and will speak on the deletion of enterprise branches and the insertion of enterprise unions later in the debate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GOVT DEM 147</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats support this amendment. The statutory right of entry rights for union officials are much expanded by later amendments, rendering this extra power unnecessary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">OPPOS 302</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats oppose these amendments. These seek to make clear that the amalgamation of unions is to be encouraged and facilitated. The simple fact is that the reality of amalgamation has not met the promise. Unionisation rates continue to fall, unions have spent more energy on restructuring than on recruiting. While we supported the union amalgamation rules when first raised seven years ago, I think it is now appropriate that the Act adapt a more neutral stance on these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GOVT/DEM 148</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment seeks to establish the definition of enterprise for the purposes of enterprise unions. The definition is different from that used for enterprise agreements and deliberately so. An enterprise union can be formed in relation to a simple employer or an operationally distinct part of an employer. The term "operationally distinct" was deliberately chosen. As the explanatory memorandum makes <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5565"> clear, the fact that a place is a separate workplace does not make it operationally distinct. In jointly moving this amendment, I believe that "operationally distinct" requires something considerably more than that. It must be an operation, a distinct operation. In industrial terms, that would mean an operation capable of organising and negotiating its own industrial affairs. In major corporations, that would mean an autonomous business unit. In the Government sector, it would probably mean a Government department or statutory authority. What the Commission should seek to avoid is a situation where the senior managers charged with industrial negotiations end up dealing with more than one enterprise union in their operation. This is a fairly tight criteria and combined with the tight criteria in proposed 189(1C), it will ensure that truly independent, truly enterprise based unions can be formed, and not sham bosses unions as part of a divide and conquer campaign.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats support this amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GOVT/DEM 150-153</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments establish a range of changes to union registration rules. I will deal with them briefly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following extensive submission from both unions and employers opposed to the Government's competitive unionism model, the Democrats have been able to persuade the Government to re-instate a version of the "conveniently belong" rule. This will avoid the free for all which would have been the result of the original bill. Unions already spend millions of dollars a year trying to steal each other's members, and the Democrats do not believe that the public interest would have been served by freeing this up completely.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the compromise in this amendment, where a union applies for a rule to cover areas covered by another union, the current union can object on the ground that the members could more conveniently belong to it and be more effectively represented by it. The second criteria is a particular improvement in our view. It means that if a union is failing to perform, it can find itself liable to competition. But, if it is performing, then it should keep its coverage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments also set the extensive rules for registration of enterprise unions. These are very tight criteria designed to ensure that enterprise unions are viable and capable of performing their functions under the act, free from influence from the employer and outside bodies and have the support of the majority of employees wanting to be covered. A union which meets these criteria would be supported. But, the amendment would avoid the establishment of bosses union, unions like the Metway Staff Association and the Bond University <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Staff Association, set up by employers to cut out real unions.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats support these amendments. While we believe that the amalgamation process has not <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5566"> been particularly successful, we do not believe that the total massive splintering of existing unions under the fairly open ended provision proposed by the Government are in the public interest. To allow unions to splinter on factional grounds or regional grounds, or to splinter back to trade-based unions, would not be in the public interest. There may be some merit in allowing unhappy marriages&mdash;amalgamations which have not worked&mdash;to be unravelled, and the ALP's amendments achieve this. Therefore we will support the ALP amendments in preference to the Government's proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's proposal to allow unions to disintegrate in any which way was obviously linked to the original competitive unionism model. Given the more regulated and orderly approach taken to rules with the re-insertion of a "conveniently belong" rule, I think that the original disamalgamation provisions are clearly inappropriate as the bill now stands.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats will support this amendment. This amendment has arisen out of the sloppy bookkeeping by some unions which wait several years before picking up on outstanding dues. I do not think that it is unreasonable to say to unions to keep their books fairly up to date and to not leave outstanding fees drag on forever. There were proposals floating around to restrict the capacity for recovery of unpaid fees to just 3 months, but we felt this was quite unreasonable, and the 12 months rule I think is a fair compromise.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats oppose this amendment. This provision reflects the simplified reporting arrangements for companies. As the unions often complain they face reporting mechanisms more onerous than companies, they should not complain when we seek to reduce them to those of companies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GOVT/DEM 160</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments set up the new statutory scheme for right of entry by union officials. The Democrats totally reject the proposals of the Government that right of entry should be restricted to a written <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> invitation. This could have resulted in union members being singled out for targeting by unscrupulous employers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The statutory scheme has three main elements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, union officials will be required to obtain a general permit for entry from the Industrial registrar. Abuse of right of entry provisions could result in the permit being removed. This is based roughly on the provisions in the NSW Carr legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Second, the scheme establishes a general right of entry where the union has award coverage to a workplace for the purposes of consultations with employees, on the giving of 24 hours notice. The NSW legislation provides for 48 hours notice, so 24 hours is in our view more appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Third, the scheme establishes a right to inspect wages books and investigate breaches more thoroughly where the union has a member or members. This distinction we believe is appropriate. Employers have complained to me of unions with no members, merely out of spite, coming in and tying up the employers books and generally acting in an unhelpful way.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In our view, unions should be concerned about the rights of the 33 per cent of members that are their members. They must have the right to recruit and meet with employees. We have provided that. But, in terms of enforcement, that should come back to only where they have members.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be pointed out that while this statutory scheme applies in relation to awards, nothing precludes the parties including even more generous right of entry provision in certified agreements or AWAs. I don't believe that agreement should reduce the right of entry clauses as this would clearly breach the no disadvantage test and the public interest requirement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I want to speak briefly to proposed section 285D(3), which makes it clear that a person in exercising right of entry is not entitled to enter any part of premises used for residential purposes except with the permission of the occupier. This mirrors the provision of section 300 of the NSW Act. Several unions with members in nursing homes and residential care have raised concerns about this provision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In moving the amendment, I wish to make it absolutely clear that this section should not be used by employers to prevent unions entering nursing homes or residential care units. The provision would operate only to prevent entry to those parts of the home used for residential purposes. And they would be the private rooms of the occupants. And even then, entry could be agreed to with the permission of the occupier. The occupier is not the employer, but the residential occupier, the aged person in the room. Clearly, the common facilities of the unit, such as common rooms, dining rooms, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5567"> bathrooms are not being used for residential purposes, and would be available for inspection under this clause.</PARA>

Senator Murray is obviously quite capable of putting his own position on the record. Again, I say to the senator that a number of honourable senators&mdash;particularly Senator Sherry on behalf of the opposition&mdash;have helped the progress of this bill by freely agreeing, without any coercion whatsoever, to incorporate their comments.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the right of entry provisions in particular, which I am sure you are concerned about, when it comes to outworkers, subsection 285BGB(4) provides capacity for a permit holder to require an employer to produce records at a premises at which the employees work and at some other agreed place. In other words, the fact that the employees do not work at the employer's premises does not preclude the permit holder from gaining access to the time sheets, pay sheets and other relevant documents. We believe that a number of concerns which have, without any doubt, been legitimately put and are accommodated under subsection 285B allow, as I said, permit holders to require employers to produce those records.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They state it makes them worried all the time about whether they will receive the money they are owed.

<STATE> (New South Wales)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(12.07 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I realise that the hour is late and that it has passed midnight, but I do rise on the adjournment debate tonight to speak on a very important issue&mdash;that is, the continuing issue of the possibility of an airport at Holsworthy in south western Sydney. For the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people of the region around Holsworthy, the Sutherland shire and the south coast, it is approaching midnight for them because it is becoming clearer that this government has every intention of siting Sydney's second airport at Holsworthy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst the current Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) claims that the government's preferred position is Badgerys Creek, it becomes clearer day by day as each announcement is made regarding the current environmental impact study that Holsworthy could well become the site for Sydney's second airport. As I have said on previous occasions when I have spoken on this matter, that will have a devastating impact upon the lives of hundreds of thousands of people in this region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently, on 6 November, the minister released a series of maps setting out the runway options for the two sites being examined&mdash;that is, Badgerys Creek and Holsworthy. In the media statement the minister made that day, he indicated that the EIS team had developed two options for both Badgerys Creek and Holsworthy. Further on in the statement he said that the runway locations and alignments on which the designs for the airport will be based are described in the brochure released by the EIS team.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The environmental consultants that have been engaged to undertake the EIS are a firm called Rust PPK Ltd. From what I can gather, they have had limited experience in respect of undertaking work on the development of a major airport. They, along with the Department of Transport and Regional Development, produced a glossy brochure, which I have with me. This brochure was part of the kit released by the minister on 6 November. Contained within that brochure are maps setting out the runway options for the two sites.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now wish to specifically focus on Holsworthy. There are two sets of options. One is called the northern option, which is close to the suburb of Lucas Heights, where the nuclear reactor is located. It is also close to Sydney's large waste disposal area, at Menai, and it is not very far from large housing <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5571"> suburban areas in Menai, Engadine, Sutherland and a range of other suburbs in that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The runways on the northern option are within the boundaries of the Sutherland shire which, as I said, already contains Australia's only nuclear reactor, contains a large waste disposal site that takes the great bulk of Sydney's waste and contains Australia's largest oil refinery. It appears that, if this government has its way, the Sutherland shire will also have visited upon it Sydney's second airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another option, which is the southern option at the other end of Holsworthy. If it were to be selected, it would have a devastating impact upon the residents of Helensburgh. It would take flights virtually right over the top of the Woronora water catchment area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I specifically wanted to draw to the attention of honourable senators this evening is that this brochure, which contains these maps, has some very major errors in it. In particular, the map produced by the EIS team has three of the major suburbs in the wrong locations. The suburbs of Engadine, Loftus and Woronora are shown on this map in the wrong locations. I will seek leave to table this map, which is the map handed out in the minister's kit that day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One has to ask how it is that, on such an important issue as this&mdash;the siting of Sydney's second airport&mdash;the company engaged to conduct the EIS and the department which is the proponent of this second airport cannot even get their map correct. It shows one of the major suburbs of the Sutherland shire&mdash;Engadine&mdash;probably five to 10 kilometres from where it actually is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You really have to ask the question: how is it that this can occur? It can be nothing short of incompetence on the part of the company and the department. It demonstrates the disregard that this government has for following a proper EIS process&mdash;something that it has stated all the way through would be evident in this environmental examination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this is the sort of community consultation that we are getting, then one can only say, `God help the community.' If a company <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cannot even get the map correct, as it currently exists, how can anyone in the community have any faith in a process which is supposed to be about locating Sydney's second airport?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also wish to take this matter further. As I said at the outset, it is becoming clearer that this government really wants to put this airport at Holsworthy. Last night I attended a public meeting conducted by the Sydney Airport Community Forum in Cronulla, and that meeting was held to enable community consultation with respect to proposals for flight paths out of Mascot airport. Airservices Australia has developed a range of proposed flight paths, and this meeting was held along with a series of meetings in other parts of Sydney to discuss those flight paths.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Sydney Airport Community Forum is chaired by Mr Joe Hockey, the Liberal member for North Sydney. He chaired the meeting last night. At that meeting he stated that it was his view that Sydney's second airport should be located at Holsworthy. This is the member for North Sydney&mdash;who represents an area that probably would be lucky to see one plane flying over it a day&mdash;telling the citizens of the southern shire and Holsworthy that they should have Sydney's second airport. He holds a senior position as chairman of the Sydney Airport Community Forum&mdash;a body which is supposed to be about consultation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It appears a decision has virtually already been made. I am here to say tonight, and I will continue to say to this Senate, that the people of south western Sydney and of south eastern Sydney and of southern Sydney do not want another airport in their locality. What they do not want and will not accept is incompetent companies and an incompetent minister and an incompetent department putting out brochures which are supposed to be about community consultation when they cannot even accurately locate on a map the suburbs people currently live in.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) No. There currently exists a very good working relationship between Australian Defence Force (ADF) military police and the respective State and Federal Police forces. Within this working relationship, effective communication is maintained at all levels and on a regular basis. During times of increased military activity, these communications links are maintained on a daily basis. The military police provide detailed briefings on the numbers of activity participants and expected levels of interaction with relevant communities, and will assist and supplement local police as required. I am advised that, due to the size of Operation Tandem Thrust, the ADF is developing specific plans to ensure the necessary liaison and communication with relevant police forces is maintained in an effective and appropriate manner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) I am advised that the exercise will centre largely on the Shoalwater Bay area of Queensland.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) ERDC had accumulated unspent funds to a level that the Government considered was in excess of its immediate financial needs.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) (a) Australia ratified the Basel Convention for the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal, which aims to minimise and control transboundary movements of hazardous wastes, on 5 February 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) The amendment referred to was adopted by consensus in September 1995 with the support of the then Government. In the Australian explanation of vote following the amendment, it was made clear that Australia would not consider ratifying the ban amendment until the current work on the definition of hazardous wastes was completed to our satisfaction. The amendment can only be sensibly implemented when its scope is clearly defined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Australia will decide whether to ratify the ban amendment through the newly-established treaty-making process, which includes preparation <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5584"> of a National Interest Analysis. The Government will ensure that there is full and effective consultation on this through the Hazardous Waste Act Policy Reference Group. As indicated above, Australia will only consider ratifying the ban amendment when there has been clarification as to what definitions of hazardous waste are covered by the Convention and the ban amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The Government is committed to full implementation of the Basel Convention as it has been ratified by Australia, and is consulting widely on the correct definition of what is and is not regulated as hazardous waste. An Australian Technical Group has been established to provide technical advice on this issue. Australia is an active participant in the international process of drawing up lists of hazardous wastes under the Basel Convention, and will be guided domestically by the results of that process.</PARA>

<PARA><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Prime Minister has provided the following answers to the honourable senator's questions:</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) I am advised that since taking up appointment as Secretary of the Department of the Prime <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Minister and Cabinet in May l996 Mr Moore-Wilton has attended six Board meetings of Southern Hydro Ltd and five Board meetings of the Public Transport Corporation. The average duration of the Board meetings is approximately 3-3&half; hours per meeting. Travelling to and from Board meetings is, where possible, made outside core working hours. In some cases the opportunity has been taken to hold official discussions in Melbourne in conjunction with particular Board meetings. On two occasions both Board meetings have been held on the same day to minimise absence from Canberra. On some occasions Board meeting dates have been changed in order to enable official PM&amp;C commitments to be met.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) I am also advised that all direct costs of Mr Moore-Wilton's attendance to the affairs of the Public Transport Corporation and Southern Hydro Ltd involving air fares, accommodation and incidentals have been met by the relevant organisation and have been fully vouched in accordance with the financial regulations of the Victorian Government. No Commonwealth allowances have been claimed for duties related to either organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) In accordance with the approval granted prior to his appointment, Mr Moore-Wilton is entitled to allocate up to one working day per month to each of the organisations on the understanding that all official duties relating to his position as Secretary, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5587"> Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, are carried out satisfactorily. In his capacity as Secretary PM&amp;C he is on call at the Government's convenience subject to any official recreation or sick leave requirements. No overtime is payable. I am advised that departmental records show that Mr Moore-Wilton averages an approximately 50-60 hour working week. Any time taken to attend to Public Transport Corporation and Southern Hydro matters falls well within the standard excess hours Mr Moore-Wilton devotes to his official duties in any one month.</PARA>
