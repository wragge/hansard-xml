<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam President, my question is directed to Senator Hill representing the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Minister, I would like you to clear up some of the confusion surrounding the visit to Australia of the Dalai Lama. Did you cancel your appointment with the Dalai Lama? Did the Deputy Prime Minister state that the government did not recognise religious visits? What, therefore, was the status of the foreign minister's meeting with the Dalai Lama? Were only spiritual issues discussed, or did the meeting cover non&hyphen;religious issues? Now that the Prime Minister has confirmed on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS>  program yesterday that he will in fact be meeting with the Dalai Lama, can you explain in what capacity he will meet the Dalai Lama? Will it be a purely private meeting, and what will be the Dalai Lama's status&mdash;that of a religious leader?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam President, it is a little disappointing that the Labor Party seeks to make cheap political points from the visit to Australia of a highly distinguished spiritual leader in the Dalai Lama. We saw it with the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> very inadequate shadow foreign minister, Mr Brereton. He was the first to go down this track when he went public and said that the Prime Minister should meet the Dalai Lama to apologise for him&mdash;a rather grubby little bit of domestic politics, I would suggest. That was followed by Mr Beazley who showed no leadership on this matter at all, and I regret to note that the ALP in this chamber wants to continue with this today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We welcome the visit of the Dalai Lama to Australia. As I said, he is a distinguished religious leader. I said the other day&mdash;you obviously didn't listen, senator&mdash;that I was pleased that Mr Downer had met with the Dalai Lama in that capacity, in meeting a spiritual leader.</PARA>

Although they seek to make cheap, grubby political points out of this visit at the moment, in fact the status of the visit and the level of recognition that is being accorded by our government were exactly that that was <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> accorded by the Labor Party during the Dalai Lama's last visit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I regret this. It is a disappointing aspect to this visit, and it simply demonstrates that the Labor Party&mdash;peeved at having lost government&mdash;is not prepared to lift itself above this grubby level of domestic politics and recognise that this is a spiritual leader who should be respected in his visit rather than used in this way.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TITLE>Telstra</TITLE>
<QUESTION PAGE="3579" SPEAKER="MacGibbon, Sen David" NAMEID="YH4" ELECTORATE="QLD" PARTY="LP" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGIBBON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Communications and the Arts. I ask if he is caught up by the statement made by Senator Schacht in the debate on the recent Telstra urgency motion in this chamber that the profit of Telstra went up 31 per cent between fiscal year 1994-95 and fiscal year 1995-96? Is there any substance for that claim at all?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="3579" SPEAKER="Alston, Sen Richard" NAMEID="LD4" ELECTORATE="VIC" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Communications and the Arts" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, Senator Schacht is quoted as saying that profit after abnormals had risen by 31.1 per cent and, indeed, he is correct. There would not be a company in Australia today that would mind being a sheltered workshop if its profit went up by 31 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What Senator Schacht does not understand is that you do not use these sorts of numbers to make comparisons between years, because the whole point of abnormals is that they are one-off. Telstra itself conceded that this is not the right number to use for comparisons. Here is what Frank Blount said&mdash;and I hope you will take this down:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In some respects this figure is a little flattering, because it's about 30 per cent higher than last year. In fact there's been a turnaround of abnormals of about $770 million. Last year we were down more than $550 million because we made a superannuation provision. This year a change in our depreciation methodology has bumped us up by $200 million. The number you should use for comparisons year on year is profit after tax but before abnormals.</PARA>
<PARA>Telstra did not report that figure, but it can be calculated. Indeed, BZW, Senator Schacht's favourite investment bank, says that profit after tax before abnormals was $2.1 billion in 1994-95&mdash;up by two per cent, not 31 per <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3580"> cent. According to BZW, overall a two per cent profit growth is not very encouraging.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is quite clear that Senator Schacht still has not the vaguest idea about how one measures profitability in the marketplace. It is very disappointing that he simply has not been prepared to do his homework on this or a number of other issues. As we know, he is still getting around to asking someone to do a ghost draft of his submission to the ABC, to the Mansfield inquiry. About the most he has been able to contribute to this debate so far is that he put out a press release on 1 September apologising for inadvertently referring to Donald McDonald as `Donald Donaldson'. He told the press to `please amend his statement'. He apologised for any inconvenience. That is a pretty good contribution to the ABC debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was even more perturbed when I was surfing the Net the other night once again to discover that, when you look at Senator Schacht's home page, the last update is 22 February 1996. What do you find there? You find all sorts of goodies, Madam President. Senator Schacht's is listed in his capacity as Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction, so time stands still for this lot. Senator Schacht says, `If you want to know what we've been up to, you can go to my home page and see the hot issues area.' What happens when you go to the hot issues area? You get one of the best one&hyphen;liners of all time: `Labor's reality versus John Howard's rhetoric. If you would like to have your say, click here.' You really cannot get much lower than that. He has not got time to update his home page; he has not got time to do any work on his ABC submission; and, he can't even get the name of the ABC chairman right. What is he doing? Why doesn't he go and see BZW and get a sensible briefing, and then he will have an understanding of this issue?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just in case you might like to start doing a bit of research, what you will find, for example, on the issue of privatisation is that a good friend of yours, Nelson Mandela, has made a useful contribution on the subject. What he said recently was this: `Privatisation is the fundamental policy of the ANC and it's going <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to be implemented.' That really says it all, does not it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If only you would go and do your homework. I know it is difficult whiling away those long, lonely hours in opposition but, rather than twiddling your thumbs and playing pure politics, why can't you do some homework? Take a refresher course&mdash;or probably, in your case, a primary course&mdash;on the basic economics, and you will understand that Telstra's profit performance is not all that good. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></ANSWER>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A very good question, too. We are pleased to see the overwhelming level of public support for the government's budget strategy. It is not surprising because that is exactly what the public elected us to do. Just recently, it was demonstrated by the Morgan poll&mdash;I mentioned that the other day&mdash;which showed that 77 per cent of people, including at least 60 per cent of Labor supporters, rated the budget as higher than any of the previous Labor budgets. Sixty per cent of Labor supporters said that we were doing a better job on economic management than 13 years of Labor.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is reinforced today by the poll that appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>. I will just run through a few of these figures for the benefit of the Labor Party, in particular: best party to handle interest rates, the coalition by 44 per cent to 26 per cent; best party to handle taxation, the coalition by 40 per cent to 28 per cent</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Best party to handle inflation, the coalition by 45 per cent to 25 per cent, Senator Ray; best party to handle the balance of payments, the coalition by 46 per cent to 21 per cent. Just in passing, I might <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3582"> say, it says that the best party to handle the environment is the coalition, Senator Faulkner. That is a little closer but isn't it interesting that the public of Australia recognises that the new coalition government is even better at handling the environment than the Labor Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is important, Madam President, because it demonstrates that it is still the view of the Australian public that the policies upon which they elected us they wish to see implemented. In other words, the budget that we put down which took the hard decisions they endorse and they want to see passed in this chamber. That is critically important. Why is it? It is because people are still reflecting upon the failures of Labor and the consequences of those failures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind you, Madam President, that, under Labor, general government debt increased from $17 billion in 1990 to $96 billion last year. If there had not been any adjustment in this budget it would have increased to $120 billion. That is what the people of Australia were not prepared to cop any more. That would have been an increase of over 600 per cent in just 10 years. In underlying terms, debt had increased by $69 billion in the past five years. This is the record of Labor that the Australian people rejected. It has a consequence because it means that 7.5 per cent of this year's budget outlays are going to meet the cost of debt that Labor ran up. We need to spend some $10 billion to pay for debt that could have been spent on much more worthwhile programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Michael Egan, the Labor Treasurer in New South Wales, even recognised it when he said recently that more debt now simply means bigger interest bills in the future and fewer dollars to spend on hospitals, schools, roads and other key priorities. That is what the people of Australia rejected at the last election. They wanted us to take a new direction and they wanted us to take the hard decisions. We have done that in this budget. Now they want this budget passed in order that the benefits that can flow from those hard decisions do flow, to the benefit of all ordinary Australians. </PARA>

ATSIC's own estimation at the beginning was very small, that that should be so. When you are talking about relative costs, the Matthews report on Hindmarsh Island cost over $1 million and ATSIC contributed over a quarter of a million dollars to that. When you are talking about relative costs, Senator Kernot, you really have to consider the value that is obtained from expenditure of funds.

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Probably the Hobart <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS>  said it all in its headline which was `Bookings bonanza'. Since the announcement of this scheme on 23 August, there have been an unprecedented number of inquiries to take up this new initiative. Bookings for sea travel across Bass Strait have gone up by 45 per cent. TT&hyphen;Line reported that more than 19,700 ticket inquiries had been made since the announcement of the subsidy. As former Premier Ray Groom said, in the 13 hours following the announcement more than 7,500 calls were made to TT's central reservations office in Devonport. This has been an enormously successful initiative to which Senator Newman was a prime contributor. It clearly demonstrates the superiority of our approach on this important issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The scheme provides for a rebate of $150 for a single trip and $300 for a return trip in the peak holiday season, slightly lower rebates applying in other seasons to reflect the lower cost. The scheme will reduce a driver's net fare when sharing a standard cabin to a similar cost to that notionally incurred in driving an equivalent distance on a highway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The scheme has been given the thumbs up by industry, certainly by the Tasmanian government&mdash;Premier Rundle and Ministers Cleary and Groom&mdash;TT&hyphen;Line and the chairman of the National Sea Highway Committee, Mr Peter Brohier. In other words, everyone who has looked at this proposal says that it is infinitely superior to the Labor alternative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been some criticism, as you would expect from a carping, negative, going nowhere opposition. Of course, what they fail to recognise is that the funding for this proposal is not capped. It will be demand driven. The scheme therefore fulfils a key election commitment to Tasmania and represents an ongoing recognition of equity for Bass Strait travellers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor's very second&hyphen;rate alternative approach to this was to put a very large bucket of money on the table in order to enable a second ferry to be built. That would make absolutely no difference necessarily to the level of cost of fares. It would simply be putting money in the pocket of a new owner. That is far from attractive to consumers.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor's funding would have miserably failed to cover future operating costs, would have provided no guarantee that travellers would have benefited from lower fares and would not have provided any competition. In other words, we are giving assistance where it is needed. It goes to the consumer; it makes travel more affordable. It is very much in line with an approach that is sensitive to consumer needs rather than simply the old Labor handout mentality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have thought now that we have seen the reaction&mdash;universal acclamation from industry, from consumers&mdash;that the least that people like Senator Sherry should do is perhaps follow Senator Schacht's example and put out a corrective statement admitting that this is yet again another very successful budget initiative. As you would know, the recent Morgan survey indicated that our budget was the most popular since 1978. One of the reasons for that is that we very carefully ensured that consumers are the beneficiaries. We did that in Tasmania in spades, and the citizens of Tasmania are very, very grateful. They certainly will not appreciate your going around carping at the margins, making yourself even more irrelevant and simply not facing up to an infinitely superior approach.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Sandy Macdonald is right in highlighting yet another area of the budget which has been very well received by the people of Australia. It is no wonder that the responses to polls such as the Morgan poll that Senator Alston was referring to a little while ago report that people are not ambivalent about this budget in any way: the highest majority since 1978 believe it is a good budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is one of the reasons why the budget has been so well received. For many years the Carers Association of Australia was a voice crying in the wilderness, with the Labor government giving it little or no attention. It was a matter of some surprise to the coalition <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3587"> that so little consideration was given to the plight of carers, because in a very practical sense they are providing a national effort which could hardly be duplicated by institutional care in this country. Even if it could, the cost to the nation would be enormous and the quality of the care could never match that of people who are giving care to those they love.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The role of the carer is one of the most undervalued in Australia, and it was certainly undervalued by the previous government. Carers go about their work in a dedicated and benevolent fashion without fanfare, without reward&mdash;and they are not really asking for that. They assist in the de&hyphen;institutionalisation of the sick and the disabled by enabling them to remain in the familiar surroundings of their home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The national carers action plan is being fully implemented, and that demonstrates our real commitment to carers. The Carers Association of Australia, in October 1994, put out a report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">`Listen to carers: the many voices of care</EMPHASIS>. On its front page, that report said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Carers are living lives of quiet drama, with little recognition or reward. Carers are angry, fed up and filling an ever increasing care gap. Carers are also exhausted, lonely, ill and poor.</PARA>
<PARA>It  took a change of government before those needs were met in a substantial and meaningful way. I would like to incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  the press release put out by the carers association entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">`Forgotten people' recognised in budget</EMPHASIS> . In that the executive director of the Carers Association of Australia is reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the fact that the Government will be establishing Carer Resource Centres sends a direct message to all carers that this Government cares about them.</PARA>
<PARA>She went on to talk about the various initiatives, such as increasing the number of respite days allowed for carers from 42 to 52 days a year, essentially recognising that carers are entitled to at least one day off a week. That is going to give them the opportunity for some sort of break. There is going to be an extra $36 million in the budget for additional respite care resources, which makes those things lock together in a very productive way.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I draw the Senate's attention to the fact that it was 1995, last year, when the previous federal government, Labor, signed on all the states&hyphen;  a mixture of coalition and Labor&mdash;on the way ahead for reform of public housing in Australia.

We are proposing to the states a cooperative, federalist model. The stalinist centralist type of government we had in the past, where Canberra dictated to the states, is behind us. We recognise that there are differences in needs and differences in circumstances in public housing and private rental housing right across Australia. That needs to be taken into account.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consequently, I go to meet with the housing ministers, the ministerial council, tomorrow on the basis that we will put down our commitments to the states. We have recognised that they will each have different needs. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> We have recognised that they have a lot of information as to the value of their assets in public housing, the amount of rent their individual tenants are paying, and regional variations. These are things on which we need to work with them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a cooperative reform. It is reform which needs to have both levels of government putting the facts on the table. We are setting up a task force of officers at state and federal level to work through the detail, the nuts and bolts, of these reforms. We are moving on and we hope that by the end of next year this will all be in place. It relies on the cooperation of the states. That is how better government comes in Australia, not by Canberra dictating to the states regardless of their needs. That is what we will be discussing in Darwin tomorrow.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it incomprehensible that a Labor Party that set this in motion is now trying a spoiler tactic to disturb it. If they do, they will be the ones whom the people of Australia will revile because it is long overdue that we look after those 900,000 people who live in private rental housing and who are paying 30 and 40 per cent of their income to get a roof over their head.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Chris Evans asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Family Services. I refer you to the recent decision by President Clinton to approve Food and Drug Administration laws, declaring that nicotine and tobacco is a drug subject to federal legislation. Why has the federal government not followed the US lead and lifted the schedule 7 exemption on nicotine and tobacco? Is it the case that the government has no intention of acting on this matter, as was claimed by government sources quoted in the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>  on 26 August this year?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government welcomes the move by the US President to further restrict the promotion and availability of tobacco products. In doing so, the USA joins many other countries in acting decisively to address the massive cost to society and the health of individuals caused by tobacco-related death and disease.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am pleased to say that Australia remains at the forefront of tobacco control and indeed many of the initiatives announced in the Clinton package have already been implemented in Australia. The major effect of President Clinton's announcement is to list nicotine as a drug of addiction, thus enabling action to be taken to restrict advertising of tobacco products. For example, billboards displaying tobacco advertising will be banned within 1000 feet of schools. The package also limits tobacco advertising in magazines. In Australia, all forms of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tobacco advertising, including billboards and in magazines have been banned outright since 1 January 1993 under the Commonwealth Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently in Australia, nicotine is listed as a poison in the Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Drugs and Poisons (SUSDP) except when it occurs in tobacco which is prepared and packed for smoking.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AMA and other health advocacy groups have called on all Australian Governments to follow President Clinton's example and to move to have nicotine in tobacco scheduled as a poison. The AMA has also been part of a coalition of health groups that has made a joint submission on this issue to the WA Poisons Advisory Committee, asking that it remove the exemption for tobacco products from Schedule 7 of the SUSDP. It seems the Opposition is now joining that call&mdash;but they seem to have misunderstood the effect of the recent US decision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Australia, as the Opposition is well aware, tobacco has been treated as a drug of dependence in the context of the National Drug Strategy (and its predecessor, the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse) since its inception in 1985. We do not therefore need to remove the exemption from Schedule 7 to enable us to address the harms caused by tobacco consumption in this country. Indeed, we have been able to achieve a tobacco control regime which is one of the toughest in the world without scheduling tobacco in this way.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nonetheless, we are keenly awaiting the outcome of the WA Poisons Advisory Committee's deliberations and will examine their decision from a national perspective.</PARA>

<TITLE>Vietnamese Refugees</TITLE>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The petition of the undersigned shows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Credible evidence of Vietnamese persecution, incredible denial by UNHCR: There is evidence that the Vietnamese authorities are persecuting Vietnamese asylum seekers repatriated from South East Asia and Hong Kong camps. Also, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees' (UNHCR) claim that its returnee monitoring officers have not uncovered even a single case of persecution is not credible, and amounts to a cover&hyphen;up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A report was released in July 1996 by the Vietnamese Australian community which compiles some of the available evidence that has been emerging. Such evidence comprises public information from Vietnamese security authorities, UNHCR's documents, testimonies of victims, and reports from news gathering organisations. The following are just 2 examples:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report provides an article by the security unit of a northern province in its publication that it had compiled dossiers to monitor the activities of 79 suspects, and that it had arrested 3 returnees for membership of a reactionary organisation, the New Democratic Party. UNHCR, in its letter to the Australian government and the Vietnamese Australian community, dismissed this evidence on 4 grounds. First, because the chief of the security unit denied all of this. Second, because the chief said while no 3 political imprisonments had been made, 2 common criminals had been imprisoned, and UNHCR interviewed one of these 2 people who admitted his common crime. Third, because that government publication was just engaging in tabloid exaggeration. And fourth, because that party was just a front to help its members obtain refugee status.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first and second of UNHCR's arguments do not even deserve a reply. They are noteworthy only as indications that UNHCR is ready, willing and able to accept whatever it is given by Vietnamese authorities. The third, if believed, would lead to all official mouthpieces of the Vietnamese authorities being dismissed as tabloids whenever it suits UNHCR's purposes. The fourth shows that UNHCR can easily be caught in action: another Vietnamese government publications listed that party among those reactionary organisations to be eliminated. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3595"> </PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">When pressed to investigate, UNHCR got a returnee to admit to its monitoring officers that he had been jailed not for political activities but for common crimes. The Vietnamese authorities later released him, saying that he `had been wrongly arrested'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has the right to see if its funding to UNHCR to help refugees has been used effectively. However, there is mounting evidence that the reverse is true. There has been evidence that UNHCR has failed to accord refugee status to many deserving people (this is the subject of at least 5 reports released in Australia, plus others elsewhere by several non&hyphen;governmental organisations). Apparently to cover up that failure, it has participated in their forced and bloody repatriation (the subject of another report, released in February 1996), and now has covered up, even argued against, what it knows or ought to know about their persecution once returned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your Petitioners respectfully ask that the Senate should: conduct a detailed and independent investigation into UNHCR's failures in protecting Vietnamese refugees.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I thought that was a most moderate contribution from Senator Woodley. I think senators have come to expect moderate contributions from Senator Woodley, because he would be entitled to stand up in this place and roundly condemn the Minister for the Environment and Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Hill) who has been given ample opportunity to comply with an order of the Senate but has failed to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Woodley and others might take their minds back to the time when the Labor government was in office. If any minister came into this chamber and provided such an abject excuse as the one that Senator Hill has given, there would have been hours and hours of debate condemning that minister. It is true that we heard these sorts of sanctimonious lectures from Senator Hill time and time again <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3597"> when he was in opposition, but of course his attitude in relation to the importance of orders of the Senate and the need for us to comply with returns to order has changed dramatically since he has occupied the executive wing of this parliament. On the path to the executive wing, he has had a Lazarus&hyphen;like conversion on these orders of the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to Senator Hill in relation to this issue: you may try to prevent these documents being tabled, but what is clearly occurring is that slowly but surely the truth is coming out. We have already had exposed through the documents tabled earlier by Senator Hill the fact that he completely ignored the advice of two of his portfolio agencies&mdash;the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and the Australian Heritage Commission&mdash;and he also ignored the advice of the World Heritage unit in the Environment Strategies Directorate of the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Through the estimates committee process, we have had the capacity to establish that a significant number of documents which have already been tabled, in response to the requests of Senate Woodley, refer to other documents that have not been tabled in this place. So the position that the Leader of the Government in the Senate has outlined on this matter stands in stark contrast with the position that he and other members of the opposition took before they were elected to government earlier this year. Every member of this chamber knows it and every reasonable and objective observer of this chamber knows that we have in this pathetic response from Senator Hill a clear case of utter hypocrisy and double standards. That is what this statement amounts to today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to Senator Hill that he can run on his issue but he cannot hide. I can assure him that when these documents are tabled&mdash;I am sure Senator Woodley and other non-government senators will be very interested in them&mdash;the opposition will pay very close attention indeed to them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will just make a few brief remarks. I notice the assurances Senator Carr has given that the opposition wishes to cooperate and wishes to ensure the effective running of this Senate. We welcome that statement and we will look anxiously and eagerly to see whether it has substance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to sessional orders, perhaps it is worth putting on the record the nature of what <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> has happened so that people who may have listened to Senator Carr are not misled. We have some sessional orders which are working comparatively well. There is some experience in working those sessional orders, so the chamber itself is working well under those sessional orders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can those sessional orders be improved? The answer is yes. Is there a proposal to improve the sessional orders? The answer is yes. The proposal to improve the sessional orders has in fact been agreed to by every party in this chamber&mdash;the government, the opposition, the Greens, the Independence and the Australian Democrats. As far as I am aware, there is general agreement that we can improve on the current sessional orders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So why haven't we got these new sessional orders? The answer simply is that the Labor Party is not prepared to allow the new sessional orders to come in without agreement on a range of other issues. If we distinguish the sessional orders from the other issues, there is complete agreement, as far as I am aware. You have loaded onto the proposal to bring in the new sessional orders a number of other issues and those issues, as you well know, have not been resolved at this stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The motion before the chamber is to continue with the sessional orders, which are currently being used in this chamber and which are currently working comparatively well. We would prefer to bring in the new sessional orders, which we think would be an improvement. But I wait for you, Senator Carr, to come around to my office or to give me a call and say that you want to speak with me. What I want to hear from you is that the Labor Party will now accept these new sessional orders, which you fully agree should be brought in. At that moment I will come into the chamber, I will move them and they will come in. As far as my own side is concerned, the cooperation I am receiving is excellent.</PARA>

I simply do not know whether the Australian Democrats and the Greens have been expressing that concern, but they may well have been. He is prepared to look at the setting of the levels of the fees.

It has operated for six years; in itself, I think that is a unique characteristic.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, an excellent chair, and the Labor opposition were pleased to support his being reappointed to that position. As I say, this committee is almost unique in the annals of Senate select committees in that there has been a broad spirit of bipartisanship in its operation, and it has been recognised as having produced an extremely good set of reports that have usually been listened to by government. So it is an important committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3601">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to the issues, there is a range of matters relating to the budget announcements in respect of superannuation that are being referred by this motion to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation. I will run through some of those issues and outline why Labor has taken a decision to refer these matters to the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the first issue, that is, the 15 per cent surcharge that has been introduced in the budget to apply to superannuation contributions for high income earners as defined, there has been a lot of debate. I do not know whether Senator Allison saw the estimates proceedings last night, but we spent about an hour and a half trying to determine what is a tax and what is a surcharge. For the purpose of the government's accuracy, we have referred to it here as a surcharge, but it is in fact a tax, a new tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we look at page 10 of the budget document for the Treasury portfolio, I find it fascinating that Treasury itself refers to it as an increased tax on superannuation. We find it interesting that Treasury documents refer to it as a tax. Even though we pressed Senator Short somewhat on this issue, when we attempted to ask the tax office people last night for the definition of a tax, amazingly they were not allowed to give us one. We must be the first country in the world where the tax office has been prevented by its minister from being allowed to answer the question of what is a tax and what is a surcharge. There was just no answer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, when we put this question to Treasury, its officers were not prepared to define what is a tax and what is a surcharge. As I said, we must be the first country in the world where the tax office and Treasury cannot decide what is a tax and what is a surcharge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an important issue as the government went to the last election with absolute commitments to the effect there would be no increases in taxes and charges, but this is one big tax. Last night we asked Senator Short whether it was the biggest increase in revenue&mdash;it is approximately $500 million a year&mdash;in the budget. In fact, it is the biggest new tax we have seen for some time, despite <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the now Liberal government's protestations about it not being a tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At this point in the debate on this matter I want to say that Labor supports this measure. But that does not mean that there is not a range of concerns about how it will be implemented. Senator Short has been telling the world that I am responsible not only for this new surcharge&mdash;as he called it&mdash;being called a tax, but also for a range of concerns that are being raised about the administration of this new measure.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He accuses me of being a scaremonger. I am flattered that I am responsible for all of the concern that is being expressed out there in the financial community. I will read into the record a range of comments that have been made. There are 23 pages here, and this is just the tip of the iceberg. These comments have been made by a range of independent and distinguished people in the financial sector about their concerns on the issue of the administration of this measure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Society of Certified Practising Accountants&mdash;no doubt I get on the phone to them, Senator Short, and tell them, `Do what Labor wants you to do'&mdash;condemned the surcharge for being inequitable, complex, costly, inefficient, creating uncertainty and conflicting with other government policies. They went on to say that the surcharge will cost as much to administer as it is expected to collect in additional revenue. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Butler of Sedgwick Noble Lowndes noted that the government should be re-examining this tax surcharge because it looks to be producing results which may not be expected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Geoff Carmody, a Director of Access Economics&mdash;again, Senator Short thinks I get on the phone to Access Economics and push a line to them that they immediately adopt publicly&mdash;says that the disincentive effect of this application of the surcharge would be large. He suggested that the best way to tackle the problem would be to tax accumulated superannuation contributions when they are paid out at appropriate progressive tax rates. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3602">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a quote from Mr Hayes of the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants. Is this someone I get on the phone to and urge to make public statements? He said that whoever developed this change has no concept of the practical implications and the problems which it will present. Professor David Knox, a former Liberal adviser on superannuation, has been appointed as a member of the government's new advisory committee that has been set up to examine the problems associated with this new tax, as a consequence of the budget announcement. He said that the tax system for super is so complicated that most people don't understand it, and this tax makes it more complicated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the best quote of all comes from a person who is widely acknowledged in this chamber for his expertise in tax matters. Unfortunately, he is a senator who was passed over for the front bench&mdash;either ministerial or parliamentary secretary ranking. This quote is from Senator John Watson, Senator Short's colleague. We understand that he is no colleague of the Treasurer, Mr Costello, who, being his usual arrogant self, dismisses anything Senator Watson has got to say. Senator John Watson said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The heaviest burden of administering the budget tax&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>he does not call it an surcharge, he calls it a tax&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">would fall on the so&hyphen;called accumulation fund of workers. The budget policy has built a complex web for super.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Short had the gall to accuse me and Mr Beazley of allegedly having some sort of difference of opinion. We don't. The shadow ministry have made a decision on this matter. What about the split in Liberal Party ranks? Senator Watson, the very distinguished chair of the superannuation committee, was criticising this measure. Senator Watson is so concerned&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We asked last night at the estimates committee hearings&mdash;Senator Allison might also like to know this&mdash;whether this actuarial advisory committee document would be made public. Senator Short could not give us any assurances that it would be made public. That is not a critical issue, but it is important. Senator Short might like to enlighten us this morning. We did not get much enlightenment last night, but this morning he may be aware of what is happening in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last night we raised the issue of the golden handshakes measure, which applies from budget night. People have left work and received a golden handshake, but there is no definition of a golden handshake in the budget papers. It is true that this actuarial committee is to look at it, but we have people contact us who have left work, having received a significant sum of money. These people have spent the money&mdash;they have paid off the mortgage of their home; they have made financial commitments&mdash;and they do not know whether they are going to be hit by this golden handshake tax. This tax may be legitimate, but it applies from budget night and there is no definition of what constitutes <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3603"> a golden handshake. That is raising a series of broad concerns in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A range of other matters arise. There is no doubt that we will have to use tax file numbers for the collection of this new 15 per cent surcharge tax. It does apply to defined benefit funds or constitutionally protected superannuation funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have the removal of the means test exemption for superannuation funds for people over the age of 55. This issue has attracted a great deal of correspondence. I would like to take the credit for encouraging the thousands of people who are over the age of 55 who are very concerned about this new measure announced in the budget&mdash;but I can't, unfortunately. There is a great  deal of legitimate concern about this measure. We have a provision to allow the opt out from superannuation of people earning between $450 and $900 a month. That raises a range of concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Superannuation is to be removed from the Industrial Relations Act as an industrial issue. Who will monitor this? Half a million Australians, when wage negotiations take place, could be faced with a fait accompli: if you want a wage rise, take it out of your superannuation. This is a complex issue, but a very important issue to hundreds of thousands of Australians. We have the introduction of an 18 per cent tax rebate for people who contribute to a maximum of $3,000 to a superannuation fund or retirement savings. We have the introduction of retirement savings accounts. We have raised a range of concerns about the introduction of retirement savings accounts.</PARA>

I will not allege that at the moment but I would say that there are some suspiciously close associations between the current government and the big banking sector on a number of issues. This is one of them. I think I referred to them cuddling up to the banks. I noticed that the day after Mr Costello contemptuously and arrogantly dismissed a media release of mine he decided not to continue with the monitoring of bank fees and charges. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> It is another interesting indication about the level of influence of banks on this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>

What I find fascinating, if Senator Short claims we are attempting to delay, is that when we asked Senator Short about the date for the legislation&mdash;Senator Allison may care to look at the transcript of the estimates last night&mdash;we found that the legislation on most <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3604"> of these measures will be introduced this year but is not going to be passed until next year. So how can we possibly be accused of delaying? What we want is the proper committee, a committee recognised for its expertise, chaired by Senator Watson, a Liberal colleague of Senator Short's, who supports us.</PARA>

There should be a very full examination and public consultation with expeditious reporting dates on this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I reiterate that we are not interested in using this as a mechanism for delaying the budget. We are not interested in that approach. I have given that undertaking on a number of occasions; and I give it again. We support this new tax. We want to see it collected despite the fact that it was not in the Liberal Party's election manifesto at the last election. Where was their reference to a half a billion dollar a year new tax? The shadow minister has taken a decision on my recommendation and on the recommendation of our leaders to support it but there are very substantial concerns about the administration of it&mdash;the costs and the use of tax file numbers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tax applies from budget night, but it is not going to be collected until next year. The funds have to collect it in the meantime, not knowing what the law and regulations are. It really is an interesting, unique almost, approach in regard to what could be argued is a level of retrospectivity&mdash;although I do accept that governments have to make announcements on budget night with respect to a date, and legislate afterwards. There are some practical problems if they don't. Do not accept it on golden handshakes. I think there are some real problems with the operative date for golden handshakes.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not getting personal about you but I feel fairly passionate about your party, Senator Sherry. The impact of what Senator Sherry is attempting to do is to prostitute the normal processes of this Senate and, in so doing, he is running a very considerable risk of doing considerable damage to the very committee that has such a high standing and a high integrity and for which he professes to share that feeling&mdash;I am sure he does&mdash;namely, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will come to the detail in a moment. My first question to Senator Sherry: why is he proposing to expose it and its high reputation to such a risk? I will come back to the reasons why I hold that view very strongly in the course of the remainder of my remarks. I note that, yet again, Senator Sherry has professed that Labor supports the policy decision of the government in the budget to impose a surcharge on high income earners so far as their superannuation contributions are concerned. What nonsense for Senator Sherry to say that!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole thrust of what Senator Sherry and the Labor Party are doing is to sabotage the decision. He wants to sabotage this decision. All this talk about supporting it is absolute nonsense. It is simply not true. The Labor Party want to maintain the inequity and the unfairness in the superannuation system that they built up over their 13 years in office which gave quite outrageous concessional <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3605"> benefits to the high end of town, the high income earners, at the expense of the middle and lower income earners who, of course, constitute the huge majority of contributors and who will not in any way be impacted on by the decision of the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The range of superannuation reforms announced by the government in the budget will result in a fairer superannuation system which is more competitive and, very importantly, a more efficient superannuation system. The reforms will benefit families; they will benefit women; they will benefit low income earners; and they will benefit Australians in or near retirement. Families and women will benefit particularly from the rebate on spouse contributions, which will allow a contributing spouse to receive an 18 per cent rebate for contributions made on behalf of the low income earning spouse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Low income earners and women, particularly those working part time or with broken employment patterns, will benefit from the policy to provide employees with the opportunity to negotiate the payment of additional wages and salary in lieu of superannuation guarantee contributions. That measure enables people to make a choice better suited to their financial position and their family and personal circumstances. The reason why so many doubts are being raised by the Labor Party about this one is that it involves giving Australians on lower incomes a choice&mdash;a choice which Labor would never be prepared to give them because `choice' is a dirty word in the Labor lexicon. Labor believes that it is Big Brother government that knows best how people ought to be able to use their resources; therefore, Labor governments limit choice, which is precisely what they have done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Low income earners and women in particular will also benefit from the introduction of retirement savings accounts. These represent a simple, low cost, low risk superannuation product best suited to casual and part-time employees, and those who currently have multiple small superannuation accounts. Individuals will be able to nominate these accounts to receive their superannuation guarantee contributions and to amalgamate existing small superannuation accounts. This was an <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> election undertaking; in fact, it has been in our policy for a long time. Overall, it has been very widely accepted and welcomed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I will go through some more of these details. Let me say early on in my remarks that the main reason why the government is so opposed to this motion moved by Senator Sherry at this time is that it is premature. He is wanting to refer to a parliamentary committee&mdash;the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation&mdash;for consideration matters for which there is not yet in the parliament any legislation. That may well be the appropriate committee in due course to look at legislation in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Senator Sherry interjecting</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Sherry is saying that Labor accepts the policy proposal but that there is an awful lot of devil in the detail and he wants to go into all of that. That is fine. He can do that, but he does not know what the devil in the detail is at the moment because there are no bills. There is no legislation before the parliament as yet. That is going to be produced, hopefully, into the parliament before the end of this session. It is going to be produced after wide ranging consultations that the government is presently engaged in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also seeking expert advice to ensure that the implementation measures for the policy decision are introduced in a manner that is efficient, that is equitable and that is as cost&hyphen;effective and minimum cost as possible. That consultative approach encompasses&mdash;and Senator Sherry does not seem to appreciate this&mdash;a very wide range of issues. We are seeking public submissions on the requirements that will apply to public savings accounts. We will have a discussion paper out on that matter for people to consider.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have established an actuarial advisory committee which has also sought submissions but which does not have to report to the government until the end of October. That is a right and proper time to give it time to do its important work, because it is to advise the government on the most equitable application of the surcharge to defined benefits schemes and unfunded and constitutionally protected schemes. It is also looking at the golden <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3606"> handshake issue that Senator Sherry raised in his comments. We fully accept that there are technical issues that need to be looked at there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Taxation Office, along with the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, the Privacy Commissioner and superannuation industry representatives, is engaged in a program of extensive consultation to discuss the development of efficient and effective mechanisms related to the administration of the surcharge. There is also to be a joint tax office, ISC&mdash;Insurance and Superannuation Commission&mdash;and relevant industry body steering group to jointly manage the development of the systems, procedures and approaches necessary to implement the surcharge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the opposition is seeking to do here, with its now premature reference to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, is to duplicate without any significant benefit, and at potential significant cost, work that is already being undertaken by the government with all the important and relevant stakeholders who are concerned with this matter. It is obvious&mdash;at least I think it ought to be obvious&mdash;that the opposition cannot object to the fundamental fairness and benefits that will flow from the government's initiatives. Yet Senator Sherry seems to be so desperate to make a political point out of superannuation. That is a tragedy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It really is a tragedy because for years we have had an essentially bipartisan approach to superannuation. We have had our problems along the way with what the previous Labor     government proposed from time to time. But, in a spirit of bipartisanship, we have worked with the former government to produce a united, if you like, parliamentary view on superannuation for the simple reason that, if you do not do that and are all over the place in terms of division in the parliamentary ranks on this, then you create even more confusion and concern and instability in the system, which is very damaging to contributors and particularly to those approaching retirement. So I think it is regrettable that Senator Sherry is making a political point out of superannuation at the moment, particularly <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> when he claims to be supporting the overall policy objective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have here, I am afraid, is another example of empty words from the opposition about seeking to reinstate stability, certainty and confidence to superannuation when the opposition's continued campaign of scaremongering is doing irreparable damage to community confidence in superannuation. This misinformation about the government's policies appears to be part of a concerted campaign which goes back well before the budget, as I have said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Sherry has made various dire predictions about what the government was or was not going to do in terms of superannuation. None of his dire predictions have come to pass&mdash;and never were going to come to pass&mdash;yet many Australians spent many sleepless nights prior to the budget on the basis of Senator Sherry's quite unwarranted scaremongering assertions. I am sure Senator Sherry is hoping he can use the committee to undermine or defeat these measures&mdash;not on the grounds of their equity or the choice that they offer members, because that is precisely what they do. These measures produce a fairer, more equitable superannuation system for Australians. Rather, what he is trying to do is to undermine or defeat them on the spurious basis that implementation is unnecessarily burdensome or impossible. That is simply not correct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we inherited as a government were highly complex, costly administrative arrangements that make up our superannuation system. That complexity occurred almost entirely during the 13 years of Labor rule, between 1983 and 1996, for a variety of reasons. Complexity was added to complexity, layer was added upon layer, and we are at the stage now where most Australians really have the most enormous difficulty&mdash;in fact they find it impossible&mdash;to understand the superannuation system, what it is about and what it means to them. All of that occurred during Labor's 13 years in office. It had 13 years to provide a stable and an equitable superannuation system. It failed lamentably to do so. Indeed, its actions led to the quite contrary result. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3607">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The surcharge, which is the main basis of the government's superannuation proposals, will involve changes to administrative procedures. Almost all the administration involved in the implementation of the policy will be handled by superannuation funds and the Taxation Office. Contributors and employers will see virtually no impact on them of the administrative procedures required to implement the policy decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Superannuation funds will have only two obligations: firstly, to report information about the member and the amount of contributions made to the member's account during the year; secondly, to deduct an amount from the affected member's account, which amount will be notified to them by the Australian Taxation Office. Senator Sherry gave notice of this motion before we had the very extensive discussions with the taxation and Treasury officials in Senate estimates last night. I hope that, as a result of those discussions in the Senate estimates committee last night, what is involved in an administrative sense was made clearer to him. It is much less of a burden on superannuation funds than he, or they, might have imagined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, the new procedures will not affect contributors at all. They will impose some burden on the funds&mdash;we have always acknowledged that&mdash;but we have implemented them because, firstly, we want to have a fairer system and, secondly, we want to introduce that fairer system and administer that fairer system in a way that does not impose additional obligations and burdens on either employers or contributors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If a member rolls over his or her benefit to a new superannuation fund, any existing liability to the superannuation surcharge will be transferred to the new fund. If a member withdraws his or her benefit from the superannuation system, any existing liability to the superannuation surcharge will be transferred to the member. There will be appropriate review mechanisms available to deal with any dispute in relation to the super surcharge liability either by the superannuation fund or by the member. The main point of criticism that has emerged, and which I fully accept&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I accept that criticism has been levelled at the proposed administrative arrangements for the surcharge. I have been consulting, I would venture to say, much more widely than Senator Sherry has on this matter and across a much wider cross&hyphen;section of stakeholders. But I do think that several of the important criticisms that have been levelled are misguided because of a lack of understanding at this stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is claimed that the surcharge will result in increased administrative costs by superannuation funds, which will be borne by all members, not just those who have high incomes. That fails to take account of the fact that the information a superannuation fund will report to the tax office is no different from the information the fund should already maintain as part of its normal operations. It is information it should already have, apart from one significant element, and that is the tax file numbers of members. It is also information that is already required by law to be given to the majority of superannuation fund members each year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are also potential benefits in the administrative sense from what we are proposing to superannuation funds in that upgrading of administrative systems and improvements in administrative arrangements now are likely to lead to substantial cost savings in the future. For example, the use of tax file numbers will ultimate simplify superannuation fund administration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another claim is that the surcharge goes too far in requiring data to be collected for all superannuation members whereas only a small group eventually pay the surcharge. However, no&hyphen;one has yet demonstrated to the government a better approach to the collection of the surcharge than the one that has been announced. I say that despite the extensive consultations that have taken place, not just by me but more particularly by officers of the ATO, the Treasury and other officials concerned. All of us have been very heavily involved in this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The approach we have adopted has several advantages, including that it reduces the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3608"> opportunity for people to avoid the surcharge, and it places a negligible burden of compliance on employers and employees. It has been suggested to the government that employers should play a larger role in the collection of the surcharge. We dealt with that in estimates last night, at least to some extent. I certainly do not agree with this view, nor does the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst employers may know an employee's salary and wage level for the purposes of taxation on a PAYE basis, an employer would not have information on a person's taxable income, nor should they if they are receiving income outside their salaried position. But an employer would not have information on a person's taxable income, including other non&hyphen;PAYE income, personal reductions and rebates. Further, a mechanism such as has been suggested as an alternative&mdash;basically, the PAYE mechanism&mdash;would place a considerable administrative burden on employees and employers, and that would contrast with the existing arrangements which will minimise the burden on those groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another area that has been expressed as a concern is how the surcharge will apply in relation to defined benefit funds and unfunded schemes. Some people have argued that this will involve substantial complexity and perhaps herald the demise of such schemes. I think that view is unfounded, but, as I have already mentioned, an actuarial advisory committee with very high level experts, headed by the Commonwealth Government Actuary, is at the moment looking at these matters and will be advising the government on the application of the surcharge to defined benefit and unfunded superannuation schemes&mdash;and one or two other elements as well: for example, as I mentioned, the golden handshake issue. On the basis of the committee's work to date, as I understand it, there is every probability that they will<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">recommend practical solutions to these problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many other things that I could go on about in terms of the detail, but that really masks the main point that I want to make, and I want to make it very importantly to Senator Sherry. I think he is not prepared to listen, but I hope that the Democrats may <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> listen to what I am saying. We are not opposed to&mdash;indeed, we support&mdash;the parliament having the opportunity to consider the detail of what we are proposing. But it can only do that when it has legislation to consider. That legislation, I hope, will be in the parliament by the end of this session. The consultative process is continuing, there are time lines on the conclusion of all of that, and we want to have as thorough, extensive, comprehensive and meaningful consultations as possible with all the stakeholders. Only then can we really draft the legislation and feel confident that we have met the points of all those stakeholders in framing the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the government is saying is: sure, let us have a look at all of this, but you can only do it when you have got the bills. What are we going to do? If we accept this motion today, we will do two things. First, we will run the very considerable risk of major confusion, with the superannuation committee running a parallel set of consultations and inquiries to those we are doing in government now. Second, we will go through all of that process, and report; then the bills will come in and you will want to do it all again. That is a very odd way of going about things. It does not bear any relationship to logic, and Senator Sherry's motion today is not logical. It is purely a political operation, because he wants to obfuscate on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are deep divisions within the Labor Party on the question of whether they support the principle or not. Senator Sherry says that they support the principle, but have you ever seen a situation before where an opposition has said, `Yes, we support the principle of this, but there is so much in all the detail that we might knock it out.'</PARA>

They could report back to the parliament at the start of the autumn session next year, which I think starts at the beginning of February.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3610"> My amendment seeks to change the report&hyphen;back date for the items (1)(a) to (1)(f) of Senator Sherry's motion, which deal with major budget taxation and savings measures worth in the order $600 million in a full year. I think it is appropriate that the superannua tion committee give priority to these measures and completes its inquiry with sufficient time for the legislation, if any, to be dealt with by the Senate this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats have made their position clear on the general principle of the 15 per cent surcharge on high income earners. We have long advocated a more equitable taxation system for superannuation, with greater equity between high and low income earners. The measures announced by the government do not deliver that but, in our view, they at least are a significant step in that direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the method chosen by the government which raises serious implementation issues which I believe need to be examined. This can be done in a short, sharp inquiry, to determine whether the scheme can be improved to allow the government's tax initiative to then pass.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The inclusion of superannuation assets in social security means tests for mature aged beneficiaries between ages 55 and 65 is an issue which causes us some concern. My colleague Senator Woodley has asked a series of questions of Senator Newman in relation to this issue and I have to say that her answers have been less than satisfactory. A committee inquiry is, in our view, an appropriate means of finally getting the answers to the questions that Senator Newman keeps avoiding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We acknowledge that the other matters&mdash;items (1)(g) to (1)(i) were important aspects of the coalition's superannuation policies. Consistent with long standing Democrat process, we believe it is important that such policy changes be subject to a public report by the superannuation committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Short has said that this reference is obstructive and a delaying tactic. But as the government does not expect to have the legislation on these matters debated by the Senate this year, I suggest that it is appropriate to give the superannuation committee a reasonable time frame to look at these major policy issues in some detail and to allow for debate on these matters early in the next session of parliament.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill proposes changes to the Industry Research and Development Act 1986 which make the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> research and development tax concession a better value program for all Australians, both by stopping unintended use of the concession, and making the administrative procedures better suited to the needs of industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Access to the concession is to be confined to a reasonable period after the research and development activities have been conducted. This means that the tax concession program can return to its rightful focus of encouraging new research, new development, rather than encouraging consultants to plow through years of company accounts looking for a tax sweetener for their clients. The scope of this gravedigging is so extensive that these measures are expected to result in revenue protection totalling $235 million over the next three financial years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other improvements to the registration process, such as advance registration and registration of activities, also encourage companies to direct their creativity towards new technologies and markets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also validates overseas research and development decisions and internal review decisions taken outside the mandatory time periods prescribed by the Principal Act. This validation is quarantined to the effect of the mandatory time period, and will work to confirm the deductions of companies affected by these decisions. Amendments are also made to ensure that such invalid decisions are not taken again in future, without undermining the mechanisms built into the legislation to ensure that companies receive decisions in a timely fashion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of changes have been introduced to bring the administration of the research and development tax concession into line with the self assessment principles of taxation administration. These include reducing the obligations of the Industry Research and Development Board prior to registering a company, and introducing the ability to set fees by regulation in relation to applications and requests to the Board.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill represents a huge boost to the integrity of the research and development tax concession which is long overdue. I refer you to the Explanatory Memorandum to the bill for a more fullsome description of their changes and their necessity to the responsible administration of Commonwealth revenue.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Introduction</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 30 June 1994 the issue of assets tests affecting farming families access to Social Security benefits was referred to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee. On 24 August 1995 the issue of assets tests affecting farming families access to AUSTUDY was referred to the committee. On 31 August 1994 the two references were combined.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee conducted hearings through late 1994 and early 1995, and the Committee's first report dealing with AUSTUDY was presented in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3614"> March 1995. This response is to the second report dealing with the assets tests applying to Social Security which was presented in September 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principal areas on which the recommendations were made by the Committee were the application of hardship provisions, the operation of the pension loan scheme, improving the understanding of both customers and staff of options available to farm families, the valuation of assets and inter&hyphen;generational transfer of farm assets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is establishing a Special Rural Task Force to review the impact of the Social Security assets tests to ensure farm families are not disadvantaged. In particular, it will look at how the assets tests affects farmers who wish to retire on or from the family farm and pass it on to their immediate relations who are drawing their primary income from it, those who are unable to sell their property due to market conditions, who remain on relatively small or non&hyphen;viable land holdings on which they cannot generate income beyond the age pension limit, or who are unable to subdivide and sell their land due to government restrictions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Task Force will examine the detailed operation of the assets tests and hardship provisions. As part of its work, the Task Force will examine each of this Committee's recommendations. A response to all the Committee's recommendations will then be provided once the Task Force has completed its review.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response:  Noted. The matter will be referred to the Rural Task Force.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department of Social Security principally collects data necessary for determining a customer's eligibility for payment and the rate payable. To collect data outside of this purpose would generally be in breach of the privacy provisions. Furthermore, it would be costly to implement, collect and maintain the additional data and would require specific system enhancements to store and analyse this data.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Data on occupation for Family Payment customers is available for all claims lodged after 1 January 1994 and for particular groups of Family Payment customers reviewed at the end of each year. However, there still remains a significant number <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of pre&hyphen;existing Family Payment recipients for whom occupation is unknown. It would not be cost effective to review all Family Payment customers primarily for the purpose of seeking occupation data, particularly as this information is not essential for payment. However, if there is some need to review the entire Family Payment population in the future, the Department of Social Security will collect occupation data at that time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This issue will be further explored by the Special Rural Task Force with the involvement of the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Research Economics (ABARE) who can advise of other methods of collecting the data.

<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response:   Noted. The matter will be referred to the Rural Task Force.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are already a range of measures in place to lessen the impact of the assets test on farming pension customers. The effect of these can be demonstrated by the fact that 74% of farmers are paid under the pension income test rather than the assets test.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The following concessions under the assets tests are in place to assist farmers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Where a farm is transferred to a family member, the value of wages foregone by the family member is allowed when determining the amount of assets to be maintained under the `gifting' provisions under the Social Security assets test. This beneficial treatment only applies to the transfer of farming property.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The total aggregated value of a person's farm&hyphen;related liabilities can be offset against the total aggregated value of the value of the person's farm assets. For non&hyphen;farming clients, the value of individual assets can only be reduced by the value of a debt that is secured by that particular asset. This concession was introduced in recognition that the value of farm assets had commonly depreciated at a faster rate than the debt over the asset had reduced (especially in times of high interest rates). <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report noted three areas of concern in respect of the assets hardship provisions. The Government's response to each of these is as follows.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Deemed Income on Unrealisable Assets</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The deemed income (when applied) is the lower of 2.5% of the property value, the commercial lease value, or the amount of rent that could be reasonably be expected to be paid by the family member operating the farm. When a family member is running the farm, it is usually either the commercial lease value or the rent from the family member that is assessed. The calculation of the reasonable rent amount takes into account half of the family member's and their spouse's income that is over the relevant Additional Family Payment income test limit ($21,000 if the family member has no children). A telephone survey of the Department's hardship assessors has identified the most common reason for a farmer's pension claim being rejected under the hardship provisions is because the level of their available funds is well above the `severe financial hardship' threshold. It was asserted that it would only be in extremely rare cases where a person would be rejected under the hardship provisions due to the level of deemed income applied in respect of the farm assets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Gifting Provisions</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It appears that the Committee has confused the issue of gifting and inter&hyphen;generational transfers of farms as an issue within the assets hardship provisions. A farmer who is unable to receive a pension under the normal assets test because they have gifted assets may still be entitled to a pension under the hardship provisions if the person is suffering severe financial hardship that is not a direct consequence of gifting assets, or where the person is suffering severe financial hardship and could not have reasonably known that they would need to claim an income support payment at the time of the `gifting'.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">These categories, therefore, exclude access to the hardship provisions for those who gift money to divest their available funds, and those who gift assets that were producing levels of income equivalent to the maximum applicable rate of pension. Farmers who transfer farm properties are treated under the hardship provisions in the same way as if they still owned the property.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Sharefarmers &amp; Partnership Issues</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It appears that the separate issues of the administration of the hardship provisions and the treatment of partnerships and sharefarmers under the normal assets test have been confused as being one issue. Partnerships and sharefarmers are treated exactly the same way under the hardship provisions as other farmers. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3616"> </PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The differing treatment of partnerships and sharefarmers is under the normal assets test when the farmer transfers the property to a family member. If the family member is employed for less than the average wage whilst working for the family business, the value of wages foregone by the family member whilst an "employee" of the pension claimant is deducted from the value of the property for the purpose of calculating the amount of deprivation to be maintained. This recognises the fact that many family "employees" have a commitment to the family business that outweighs individual financial concerns.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This deduction for foregone wages is generally not allowed for partnerships or sharefarmers, as it is recognised that the person's income is determined by market forces and not determined as a reasonable wage amount that would be paid in an employer/employee relationship. Having stated this, it should be noted that implementing this benefit for partnerships and sharefarmers as a longer term strategy has not been ruled out.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government will establish a Rural Task Force to examine this and related issues. An inter&hyphen;departmental committee would only duplicate the work of the Rural Task Force.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response:  Supported.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A revised Pensioner Loans Scheme (PLS) will be implemented from 10 July 1996. The revised scheme aims to encourage older people to improve their lifestyles by allowing them to access capital tied up in property by giving them an income stream repayable at any time, or from their estate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a voluntary scheme that offers people who are receiving a reduced rate of pension under either the income or assets test the opportunity to use their real estate as security to obtain "a top up pension" in the form of an interest accruing loan. A person can withdraw from the scheme at any time. If someone withdraws from the loans scheme, they can elect to repay the amount owed at any time, or they can have it recovered from their estate. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This new loans scheme will be more flexible than the current scheme. The requirement that the person must have 70% of their assets as pensioner loan scheme assets has been replaced with the requirement that the person must have adequate assets to secure the loan. The revised scheme provides further flexibility by allowing applicants a choice in the size (up to a maximum limit) and the duration of payments made under the scheme.</PARA>

<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response:   Noted. The matter will be referred to the Rural Task Force.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department of Social Security and consultants, Ageing Agendas, have examined some of the alternative approaches to valuing house and curtilage. The options examined included ceasing to exempt the principal home under the assets test (with an adjustment of the assets test thresholds); and changing the differential between the homeowner and non&hyphen;homeowner assets limits to reflect the average value of pensioner housing. A third option examined was to provide pensioners the option of deciding whether they were homeowners or non&hyphen;homeowners (with non&hyphen;homeowners having the value of their home included as an asset).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ageing Agendas found in the review of the pensions income &amp; assets tests, that there was a high level of opposition from pensioners to removal of the exemption of the principal home from the assets test. They stated that opposition often came from those who would theoretically benefit from this option, due to a fear the government would eventually cause people to make a choice between essential income support and their homes.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response:  Supported.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department of Social Security is committed to providing a wide range of information relevant to farming families. The Department of Social Security contributes regularly to the Department of Primary Industries' Rural Book, which is a comprehensive guide to major Commonwealth government services and programs for people who live away from capital cities. The Department of Social Security also contributes information to the Department of Primary Industries database for the Countrylink telephone information service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the Department of Social Security has recently co&hyphen;operated with the Department of Primary Industries in the development of a drought relief information package aimed at farming <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3617"> families. The package provides information about Drought Relief Payment, hardship provisions for farmers and eligibility for Job Search Allowance, as well as more general Social Security information.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department of Social Security continues to liaise with the Department of Primary Industries about this project and the need for other products to be developed aimed specifically at the farming community, is continually being reviewed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, Social Security information products, such as You and Your Family&mdash;while not aimed specifically at farming families&mdash;provide broad, general information about eligibility, including income and assets test issues and encourage people to ring Social Security for further information.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Social Security regional offices also organise specific seminars to cover such issues when a need arises.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Research currently being completed by ABARE indicates that farmers are not aware of the hardship provisions.  As suggested by the Committee, it is likely that many farmers who are precluded under the assets test are not aware of the hardship provisions and have not tested their eligibility.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee will also continue monitoring the operation of the Act as part of its ongoing inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The major objectives of the Act were:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> to reduce the cost of private health insurance premiums and reduce the ever increasing cost of private health hospitalisation and treatment;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> to provide better value for those who take out private health insurance;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> to encourage a wider range of private health insurance products so that consumers are offered more choice about the type of cover which best suits their needs which, it was intended, would be achieved by enabling health funds to enter into contracts with hospitals and doctors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To meet these objectives the Act provided:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> organisations with the capacity to achieve efficiency gains through the implementation of casemix episodic payments for hospitals and day hospital facilities to replace the previous per diem payment system;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> for high quality and value for money products through purchaser&hyphen;provider agreements with hospitals and doctors to eliminate unknown out&hyphen;of&hyphen;pocket costs; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> consumers with access to information about health insurance issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The major reforms in the Act were the introduction of purchaser&hyphen;provider agreements, whereby medical practitioners and health funds could enter into contracts for the provision of medical services rendered in hospitals and between hospitals and health funds. The Act also contained a variety of provisions which are intended to provide consumers with wider access to information about health insurance issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The evidence provided to the Committee demonstrated that the reforms have not been successful in meeting their objectives. People have continued to drop private health insurance cover, value for money with the insurance product offered continues to be questioned and information on health insurance, although improved, still needs considerable attention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whilst many hospital agreements have been signed with health funds, very few medical agreements have been finalised. Members of the medical profession continued to argue that they would not sign contracts because they could compromise the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> independence of doctors and adversely affect patient care. It was suggested that contracts would introduce a form of US&hyphen;style managed care and lead to an abrogation of accepted clinical freedoms and the doctor&hyphen;patient relationship.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Doctors were also concerned at the oligopolistic domination of the market by health funds and the position the medical profession was in by being unable to negotiate in groups.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee understood and appreciated the concerns expressed by the doctors, however, without many contracts having been signed the claims remained unsubstantiated. The Committee has therefore recommended that medical purchaser&hyphen;provider agreements should proceed, subject to the clear recognition in the contracts of the right of the medical profession to treat patients according to their clinical needs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee considers that doctors should be encouraged to jointly negotiate with funds by using the authorisation provisions in the Trade Practices Act. The Committee believes that it is essential, and in the interest of all parties, to ensure that a level playing field is established in the negotiating environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has also recommended that public scrutiny of purchaser&hyphen;provider agreements by consumers be provided for. In addition the Purchaser&hyphen;Provider Panel should be convened and that the Panel be provided with access to agreements as part of its monitoring role relating to the contractual arrangement process.Unlike the medical practitioners, many hospital agreements have been signed. However, similar arguments about the disproportionate powers of the funds were put by the hospitals about their negotiating of agreements with the funds. Hospitals were particularly concerned that country and smaller hospitals were disadvantaged in the negotiating process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee similarly understands the concerns expressed by the hospitals over their perceived limitations in negotiating in groups with the funds. However, the authorisation provisions of the Trade Practices Act which may permit group negotiations have not been tested. The Committee has recommended that the private hospitals should also be able to arrange joint negotiations by seeking authorisation under the Trade Practices Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee received evidence from States expressing concern over aspects of the reforms contained in the Act. These concerns included:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> that the reforms provide little incentive for health funds to enter into purchaser agreements with public hospitals;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> that the policy of `equivalence' under the health insurance arrangements needed to be clarified; <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3620"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> that there was a perceived discrimination by funds against co&hyphen;located hospitals with funds currently unwilling to pay benefits;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> that the effect of the current Medicare and health insurance arrangements is to encourage funds to direct their members to public hospitals for high&hyphen;cost treatments and where a patient's stay in hospital is likely to be longer; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> recognising `service innovation' in the health area for the purpose of paying benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee believes that the full impact of the reforms on State services in public hospitals may not be known for some time and that unintended consequences will need to be addressed by the Commonwealth Government in consultation with State and Territory Governments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Turning to other issues relating to the Reform Act, the Committee considered it regrettable that the Aggregate Billing Advisory Committee had not been established, but recognised the willingness of relevant parties to now progress billing reform.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Private Health Insurance Complaints' Commissioner has been in operation for nearly six months and had received over 600 complaints and general inquiries. The most common complaints received by the Commissioner had related to benefit entitlements, including level of cover, amount of benefit and lack of notification of changes to benefit entitlements; and waiting periods, in particular the pre&hyphen;existing ailment rule. The Commissioner suggested that the majority of complaints indicated that consumers do not understand what their policy covers or what they can and cannot claim from their policy. To date health funds have been co&hyphen;operative in attending to complaints quickly, without significant differences of opinion over remedial action.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commissioner also raised with the Committee concerns that her functions, powers   particularly those of investigation and enforcement of recommendations, and duties were not as clearly and fully prescribed as they are for other similar dispute resolution bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee believes more time needs to be given to assess the types and quantity of complaints and the effectiveness of their resolution before making any firm recommendation as to any possible expanded role and powers for the Complaints Commissioner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee considers that the Complaints Commissioner's Office since its establishment has provided a valuable contribution to the health industry and its consumers. However, in such a short period of operation, the Committee believes it is too early to recommend an expansion to the Commissioner's role and powers. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also acknowledged the valuable role that documents such as the Private Health Insurance Administration Council's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Insure? Not Sure?</EMPHASIS> , and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Private Patients' Hospital Charter</EMPHASIS>  have played in informing consumers about private health insurance and their rights. However, the Committee is concerned that considerable confusion and ignorance remains widespread among consumers about private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has recommended that insurance funds, medical providers, hospitals and consumer&hyphen;oriented organisations accept greater responsibility in the production of information for consumers, the format of this information, and in the availability and distribution of this consumer information. The Committee further recommended that consumer information brochures should be made available in languages other than English.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In respect of data collection, the new arrangements under the Act came into operation on 1 October 1995. From the evidence received, these arrangements appear to have operated smoothly. A major concern put to the Committee related to duplication in data collection at the Federal and State levels. The Committee has recommended that data collection at these levels be reviewed to ensure that any duplication of effort and resources is prevented. The Committee also recommended that the Private Hospital Data Bureau be established and that its role in the future collection and dissemination of data be included in the review.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I table the report of the Senate Employment, Education and Training Legislation Committee on the Employment, Education and Training Amendment Bill 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the Bill be passed without amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill represents the first step in the process of changes to the education advisory mechanisms set out in the government's policy statement on higher education <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Quality, diversity and choice. </EMPHASIS> The Higher Education Council and the Australian Research Council will continue as independent Councils, with similar functions, and with their membership unchanged, reporting directly to the Minister. The Councils will also take responsibility for promoting informed public debate and for granting financial assistance for innovative projects. There is also provision for the Councils to cooperate to provide advice to the Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Board, which was established by former Minister Dawkins in late 1988, took some years to settle into its role, and appears to have had difficulties ever since gaining the full commitment of the various players in the education and training sector. While it has contributed to a cross&hyphen;sectoral view of policy matters, it has also been yet another layer of bureaucracy filtering advice from the expert Councils. The government's intention to replace NBEET with more streamlined advisory mechanisms has been on notice for quite some time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The overall thrust of the evidence received by the Committee argued for the importance of portfolio advisory mechanisms being independent and publicly accountable. The requirement for independence ensured that government departments and agencies did not monopolise the advice available to the Minister. Accountability turned on the need for the activities of advisory groups to be open to public scrutiny, and in particular that their reports should be tabled in Parliament. The Committee has so recommended. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is of the view that diverse and independent sources of advice to the Minister and to the Parliament are to be encouraged, and that any future advisory framework should be expedited. The Minister has indicated that the government has already embarked on the relevant consultations with a view to ensuring that appropriate alternative advisory arrangements are quickly established..</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government will take advice from a range of bodies such as the Ministerial Council (MCEETYA), and will commission specific reports from appropriately tailored expert committees and from existing research organisations. The government believes that such an approach will provide flexibility, an efficient advisory process, and will avoid the necessity for retaining a fixed overarching structure through which advice must be filtered.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Public accountability will be achieved through the requirement that reports commissioned by the Minister will be tabled in Parliament. Accountability will also reside in the State and Territory Parliaments, especially for the schools sector. The Committee acknowledges that there will be an interim period of adjustment to the proposed new arrangements, but this is no more than the standard impact of structural adjustment. Schools, universities and training colleges will not be impeded in their day to day work during this interim period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Legislation for the Higher Education Council and Australian Research Council will be introduced in the 1996 Spring session of Parliament, once the government has had an opportunity to examine the responses to its Discussion Paper.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe this report by the Employment, Education and Training Legislation Committee to be quite important. Many will not see it as being important. Many will say that the abolition of NBEET is only a small budgetary item, at some $6 million. I note that Senator Tierney has had his remarks incorporated. There is no doubt in my mind that he is, quite properly, embarrassed. He has every reason to be embarrassed. I believe that Senator Tierney does know something about educational matters, unlike, perhaps unfortunately, the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3622"> An essential in this matter relates to the way in which advice is tendered to both the government and the parliament on an independent cross&hyphen;sectoral basis. The abolition of NBEET is an important issue because it goes to the very basic issue of how well Austral ians, this parliament and the minister understand the need to address the crucial linkages between the nation's economic performance, its employment parameters and the implications that arise from those considerations for the role of the education and training sectors. That is essentially the conclusion that was reached by the Wiltshire review into NBEET, which was conducted in 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party and the Australian Democrats have together presented a dissenting report on the amendments being proposed to the Employment, Education and Training Amendment Bill which seek to abolish a longstanding body&mdash;NBEET, the National Board of Employment, Education and Training. We believe that the proposed changes to the advisory mechanisms, including the abolition of NBEET, are wrong. We believe that the minister has conducted this in a manner which effectively closes down the operations of NBEET and its councils before the parliament has had an opportunity to deal with the relevant legislation. That was wrong. In my judgment, it was not within the law for her to undertake the closure of these bodies in the manner in which she did. The failure of the minister to set out the reasons for her decision was a contemptuous action by her in the way she effectively dismissed the chairs and members of this body's board and councils, which are protected by legislation. We also believe the government and the minister have failed to explain any meaningful strategy concerning the establishment of alternative advisory mechanisms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is with that in mind that we raise this in the context of DEETYA having done very well out of this decision, because it means they do not have any counterweight. They have no mechanisms available through formal legislative means to provide this parliament with counter&hyphen;advice on an independent and a cross&hyphen;sectoral basis. I think that is the problem with this. Why is cross&hyphen;sectoral independent advice so important? Quite clearly this government fears independent advice. Right across the board they are abolishing independent sources of advice in such a manner as would provide opportunities for the government and ministers to pick on a hand&hyphen;picked <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> basis appropriate people to tell them what they want to hear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In education that is a particularly dangerous proposition. The complexities of the issues, the range of interest groups involved and the manner in which these interest groups are often at each other's throats mean it is extremely difficult for any government, but particularly this government given the minister's ignorance about the issues concerned, to be able to move through the differences that exist within this industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why was NBEET so important in that regard? Because it provided a vehicle by which people from different sectors with different interests had to confront their prejudices. They were forced to come together and confront their prejudices in a manner which, in my opinion, led to a much better weighing and balancing of the various claims of the various interest groups and, in my judgment, facilitated a much more coherent policy approach. That is quite clearly absent, given that the government has proposed no viable means to provide for independent cross&hyphen;sectoral advice under its new arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the government is free to pick and choose what advice to call upon. I understand governments are entitled to pick and choose to act on advice, but I find it extraordinary that this government is so intent on cutting off from itself independent advice which may in fact save this country considerable difficulty in financial and, more importantly, in social terms. Getting it wrong in education has enormous implications for this country as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3623"> In the evidence presented to the committee, I note the speed and the alacrity with which DEET officials went about disbanding NBEET. One can understand why. DEET has for some time sought the removal of that independent cross-sectoral advice in such a way to make sure that it and of course the state governments become the key sources of advice on quite complicated matters. Bear in mind that this portfolio has $14 billion or thereabouts of expenditure per annum. Bear in mind the crucial role that this portfolio plays in terms of the development of Austral ian society, given the importance of education, training and employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, in effect, we rely entirely upon the actions of the state governments, made up of ministers whose idea of the long-term view is the end of their desk and whose idea of the Commonwealth's role in education, for instance, is that it should just sign the blank cheque and leave the rest to the states. We see appalling circumstances right around this country of the consequences of that sort of attitude, where they resent the involvement of the national government and the involvement of a coherent national policy framework.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you leave it to the states, the parochial interests will always dominate over the national interest. The broader view will always be sacrificed to the short-term, narrow view in terms of the political interests of parochial state governments made up by and large of parochial state ministers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To me this notion that somehow or other we hand over the money to the states and that premiers, if they so choose, can wallpaper their offices with it is a totally inappropriate means by which to run education and training policies. That is basically the situation that will arise under this new framework which this government is embarking upon. We are left with no other option but to conclude that this government will from time to time seek hand&hyphen;picked persons to provide the words of comfort that it seeks to resolve what are very complex issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of particular concern to me is the way in which the school sector is effectively being locked out of the national policy process by the actions of this government to abolish this board. There is no vehicle for the sector to provide advice on an ongoing basis, to provide the institutional memory that is necessary to ensure the participation of teachers as well as parents in the formulation of national policy. That was quite clearly the view parents put to the committee and it is a view that quite clearly this government is not interested in. I think the bureaucracy does a very good job in many regards, but it should not be the sole source of advice on quite complex issues.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the amendments being proposed by the government, the main concerns raised by witnesses in the higher education sector and the Australian Research Council were the premature nature of the government's moves to introduce such measures and to provide for a legislative framework which had not allowed for appropriate or detailed consultation with the industry in such a manner which reflected a high degree of bad faith on behalf of the government with regards to the present and what I think ought to be regarded as proper consultative processes. When you add to that the demise of the School Council and the Language and Literacy Council, you see that there is a considerable loss of effectiveness, comprehensiveness and real quality in advice that has been provided by NBEET over the last few years. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes. The Commonwealth has received a number of requests from Tasmania for approval of forestry operations in areas included in the Interim Forest Area under the Commonwealth&hyphen;Tasmanian Interim Forest Agreement (IFA) when it was signed in January.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the IFA, the Interim Forest Area is broadly defined as all public native forest areas available for harvesting which are not specified in Forestry Tasmania's Three Year Wood Production Plans for 1995&hyphen;96 to 1997&hyphen;98 (the WPP), as amended in accordance with Schedule 1 of the IFA. At this stage, no changes have been made to the IFA or its schedules. These requests are being considered by the Commonwealth in accordance with the provisions of the IFA. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3625"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The relevant provisions of the IFA under which applications to harvest within the Interim Forest Area or to amend the WPP have been made, and the areas (districts) involved are as follows.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Clause 6 of the IFA permits completion of harvesting operations commenced before the IFA came into force, subject to case&hyphen;by&hyphen;case consideration by the Commonwealth, notwithstanding that the operations are in the Interim Forest Area. Earlier this year, the Commonwealth approved completion of operations in coupes in the Bass, Eastern Tiers, Huon and Murchison districts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Clause 7 of the IFA permits mining in the Interim Forest Area. In response to a request affecting an area roughly in the vicinity of  St Valentine's peak, the Commonwealth agreed that salvage of wood, the felling of which was absolutely necessary to allow mining activities to proceed, was consistent with the intent of clause 7 of the IFA. Tasmania has asked that the Commonwealth also consent to salvaging of wood felled during upgrading of transmission lines in the Central Highlands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Clauses 12 to 15 of the IFA describe a process for reviewing the status of areas (as either included or excluded from the Interim Forest Area) in exceptional circumstances. Any changes must be by amendment to Schedule 1 of the IFA and must be consistent with the objectives of the agreement. Commonwealth officials have agreed in principle to a number of amendments to the WPP where the circumstances meet the requirements of clauses 12 and 12.1. The areas involved are in the Huon and Mersey districts. The Commonwealth is currently considering a request to review the status of a further set of areas, in the Bass, Circular Head, Derwent, Huon and Mersey districts, under this part of the IFA. This request is to both add and remove areas from the WPP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) Clause 11 of the IFA provides for variation of the agreement, in writing. The Commonwealth is considering a number of changes to the status of areas requested by Tasmania which do not come within the above terms of the IFA. These affect areas in the Bass, Derwent, Eastern Tiers, Mersey and Murchison districts. Amendment of the agreement would be required for the requests to be met.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">These proposed variations represent a net change of about 4 per cent of the total number of coupes included in the three year WPP. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any variations to the IFA and its schedules must be in writing and will be agreed by the Prime Minister and Premier of Tasmania. All requests for changes to the Interim Forest Area or the IFA will be considered by the Commonwealth in light of the objectives of the agreement. Relevant Commonwealth agencies provide advice on the conservation values (including National Estate values) of the areas involved in a process mirroring the process by which the Interim Forest Area was initially established. Due consideration will be given to maintaining options for a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system. Other considerations may include:</PARA>
<PARA><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3626"></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need for the request to be met before the Regional Forest Agreement is finalised (June 1997);</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The potential to remove equivalent areas from the WPP, thus the net change to the volume of wood harvested and the area and types of forest cut;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other terms of the IFA, such as those requiring consistency of treatment between the States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the requests received to date have arisen from operational needs, the exceptional circumstances provisions also provide a mechanism whereby either party can seek to have the status of an area reviewed where conservation values are threatened or newly identified.</PARA></ANSWER></ANSWER.TO.QON></ANSWERS.TO.QUESTIONS></HANSARD>
