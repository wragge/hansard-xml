<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That we are opposed to any moves to cut funding to universities. We believe that further reductions in university funding would have a serious impact on the quality of higher education, and on access to university study for the Australian community. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> We emphasise that higher education has already absorbed substantial cuts in real funding levels over the last decade and that further reductions are unsustainable</PARA>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">PETITION</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">TO THE HONOURABLE THE SPEAKER AND MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES ASSEMBLED IN PARLIAMENT</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the following circumstances:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Therapeutic Goods Administration Commercial Services</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In light of the recent advertisement by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) intending to provide consulting services to the Therapeutics Industry we, the undersigned, wish to petition the House. We are strongly opposed to any extension of commercial services for the reasons given below.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. The proposed commercialisation is in direct conflict with the TGA regulatory charter and mission statement. The TGA intends to provide consulting services to the same industry that it is required to legally regulate. The TGA has not identified how it will guarantee absence of conflict of interest in the execution of its statutory duties and its intended commercial services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">TGA's Mission Statement</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"To ensure the safety, quality and efficacy of therapeutic goods available in Australia at the standard equal to that of comparable countries, and to ensure that premarket assessment of therapeutic goods is conducted within a reasonable time."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. The TGA has not identified how its.commercial services will not be underwritten by taxpayers, with respect to cross subsidisation, infrastructure, research facilities, resources, professional indemnity and personnel. For example:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i) commercial activity might well be given priority over industry regulation in the event of a shortfall in personnel resources</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii) the notification to industry of intent to provide these services through the TGA News, is an example of cross subsidisation and potential conflict of interest. The TGA News is funded through taxation and represent the policy of TGA to Industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. The TGA has not demonstrated how it will be able to discharge its legal responsibilities effectively with respect to the regulation of commercial laboratory testing services without fundamental conflict of interest. The TGA is required to regulate and licence commercial laboratories and this is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> done effectively through the provision of expert auditors from the Therapeutic Goods Administration Laboratories (TGAL). The TGAL will be offering commercial testing services in direct competition with the same industry segment it is required to regulate. The TGA will continue to have access to commercial-in- confidence client information, contracts and confidential methods while still regulating its competition.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4. The TGA has recently been accredited by JAS-ANZ to provide certification services to industry for ISO 9001 conformity. JAS-ANZ recognises the likelihood of conflict of interest by its members and specifically precludes the offering of commercial services such as consulting or training, directly by, or via an identifiably related body, by a JAS-ANZ accredited organisation. (JAS-ANZ Policy # 6/94. Relationship Between Certification Bodies and Consultancy)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5. The Kean Report on Australia's Standards and Conformance Infrastructure&mdash;1995, strongly opposed the provision of commercial consulting services by JAS-ANZ accredited bodies such as Standards Australia and NATA unless these operations were clearly differentiated and strictly isolated from regulatory or certification activities. The TGA has not identified how it intends to overcome this principle, given that it has a statutory requirement to regulate a sensitive industry and has the authority to refuse licensing or revoke existing licences to manufacturers. The same situation applies to product registration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6. The TGA has not identified whether its commercialisation will have any impact on its current membership of the EU Pharmaceutical Inspection Convention (PIC) for the same reasons outlined in 5 above. Membership of PIC by the TGA confers substantial advantage to the Australian Therapeutics manufacturers, is the subject of Heads of Government agreements and was gained over many years at taxpayers expense. The TGA has not provided the industry with assurances that the proposed services are not in conflict with PIC policy. In any event the membership, which is a status that adds to the TGA's attractiveness as a consultancy, was gained at taxpayers' expense.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7. The TGA intends, presumably underwritten initially by taxpayers, to compete directly with already existing commercial services. Almost all of the commercial providers are small business or sole traders who have invested capital and provide employment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">8. The Therapeutic Goods industry in Australia is already professionally serviced by many professional consulting, contract testing, product registration and training organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe that these fundamental issues require full evaluation before any extension of commercial <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6736"> services are offered either directly by TGA or by any related body. We are however in favour of the TGA offering services to other international regulatory bodies because there is no conflict of interest.</PARA></SPEECH></PETITION>

<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Note 2 of the Rules advises that they commence on the day on which they are made, that is to say 12 September 1996. However, the final paragraph of the Explanatory Statement advises that they commence on gazettal, which the Committee understands was 18 September 1996. If Note 2 was intended to be part of the Rules and the Rules have <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> any adverse effect on any person then they are void under s. 48(2) of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Acts Interpretation Act 1901</EMPHASIS> . If they do not form part of the Rules then the Rules commence on gazettal and the Note is wrong and presumably void. The Committee would be grateful for your advice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The final paragraph of the Explanatory Statement advised that the Insurance and Superannuation Commission intends to administer the instrument as if it had taken effect on  1 January 1996. The Explanatory Statement further advised that it was not expected that the changes would affect rights or impose new obligations. It also advised that the ISC had been administering the intent of the rules rather than their literal provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This advice in the Explanatory Statement is a matter of some concern. If the Rules have no adverse effects on any person then they could and should have been made retrospective to</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1 January 1996. If there is any adverse effect at all then the solution is to amend the enabling Act to provide for prejudicial retrospectivity. It would, as I say, be of concern if a Commonwealth statutory officer is, or was, administering legislation not according to its provisions but according to what the officer considers the provisions should be. The Committee would appreciate your early advice.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">COMMISSIONER'S RULES NO 22&mdash;LIFE INSURANCE ACT 1995</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter dated 25 October 1996 concerning the above Commissioner's rules.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I sought a response to the matters raised in your letter from the Insurance and Superannuation Commission (the "Commission"), which I have now received.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You are right in pointing out that note 2 to the Commissioner's rules incorrectly states that the rules commence on the day on which they are made. It should have said that they commence on the day on which they are notified in the Gazette. This was an inadvertent error.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, by virtue of paragraph 46(1)(a) and subsection 13(3) of the Acts Interpretation Act <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6738"> 1901, footnotes and endnotes in statutory rules are not taken to be part of the rules. Hence, the note, although erroneous, has no legal force or operation, and Commissioner's rules number 22 in fact commenced on gazettal, by virtue of subparagraph 48(1)(b)(iv) of the Acts Interpretation Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To prevent note 2 from causing confusion, the Commissioner has made a variation of Commissioner's rules number 22 which corrects the note. A copy is enclosed for your information. It will be laid before both Houses shortly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I also agree with your comments about the final paragraph of the explanatory statement, to the effect that Commonwealth officers must administer the law as it is, not as they consider it should be. I should say that the Commission also agrees with those comments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By way of explanation for the final paragraph of the explanatory statement, the changes made by Commissioner's rules number 22 to the earlier Commissioner's rules dated 20 December 1995 which they replaced were of a very minor technical nature only, and Commissioner's rules number 22 actually reflected both the original intent behind the earlier Commissioner's rules and the way in which life insurance companies had been applying the earlier Commissioner's rules. The changes to the earlier Commissioner's rules made by Commissioner's rules number 22 did not adversely affect policy holders but in fact, in some circumstances, advantaged them slightly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, you are undoubtedly correct in pointing out that the law must be administered according to its letter, and therefore:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the Commission has undertaken to write to all life insurance companies telling them that they must strictly apply the earlier Commissioner's rules until the date on which Commissioner's rules number 22 commenced; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the Commission has also amended the explanatory statement by removing the offending final paragraph, and will lay the amended explanatory statement before both Houses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A copy of the amended explanatory statement is enclosed for your information.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In my view, these steps should rectify the problems with Commissioner's rules number 22 that you have identified. Accordingly, if you agree that this is the case, I would be grateful if you would withdraw your notice of motion of disallowance of 6 November 1996.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to the Export Control (Hardwood Wood Chips) (1996) Regulations, Statutory Rules 1996 No 206. The Committee would appreciate your advice on the following matters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Regulation 8 sets out a number of matters which the Minister may consider before deciding whether to grant a provisional licence. A number of these relate directly to the applicant and information in respect of them would presumably be provided by the applicant itself. Paragraph 8(h), however, provides that one of the matters is the commercial reputation of the applicant. This is a subjective decision and, although it may be appropriate, it would seem necessary, in order to protect personal rights, for the Regulations to provide that the applicant must be notified of any adverse material under this heading, and be given a right of reply.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Part 7 of the Regulations provides for extensive rights of reconsideration and review. There is, however, a number of decisions for which these rights do not appear to be provided. These include, for instance, certain decisions under rr.10, 11, 19, 22 and 26. In particular, there does not seem to be reconsideration or review of a decision under r.32 to suspend or vary a licence. Given that original grants and conditions are reviewable, as is revocation of a grant, it would appear that r.32 decisions, which would affect commercial operations and livelihood, should also be reviewable. The Committee would appreciate your assurance that any exclusion from review comes within the relevant guidelines of the Administrative Review Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Many decisions under the Act must be accompanied by a statement of reasons. However, there is no requirement for a statement of reasons for r.32 decisions. Also, although decisions under r.34 to refuse an assignment of a licence are subject to reconsideration and review, here again there appears to be no provision for a statement of reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Subregulation 36(4) provides that the Minister must reconsider certain decisions within 45 days of a request to do so. There are, however, no time constraints on the making of the original decisions which are subject to this reconsideration process. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6739"> The Committee would be grateful for the reasons for this.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Regulation 40 provides that the Minister may delegate his or her considerable powers in this sensitive area to any officer of the Department, no matter how junior. The Committee asks the reasons for this.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator O'Chee</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of 13 November 1996 to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the Hon John Anderson MP in relation to the Export Control (Hardwood Wood Chips) (1996) Regulations, Statutory Rules 1996 No 206 (the</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regulations). As Acting Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, I am responding to your letter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On a general note, the Regulations were drafted in full consultation with industry representatives and in full knowledge of applicants' rights under the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975, the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977, and principles of natural justice applicable to administrative decision-making. Further, the Regulations were considered by the Family and Administrative Law Branch, Civil Law Division, in the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department prior to their consideration by the Executive Council. It found the proposed Regulations met the Commonwealth's administrative review policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to the specific matters raised in your letter, I would like to provide the following advice:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. In relation to Regulation 8 (particularly paragraph 8(k)), I agree that some subjective assessment may be required to determine "the commercial reputation of the applicant" in relation to the issue of a transitional licence. I also agree it is a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> matter of natural justice that any adverse material considered by the Minister under this heading should be provided to the applicant with an opportunity to respond before any decision is made. This has been the approach of Mr Anderson in dealing with transitional licence applications to date. I note that failure to observe matters of natural justice would be reviewable (see section 2 below).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further, the commercial reputation of an applicant could also be a relevant matter the Minister needs to consider in relation to an application under the Regulations for an RFA licence, a degraded forest licence, or a restricted shipment licence. In the same way, any failure to make available adverse material to the applicant for comment prior to the Minister making a decision, could be subject to review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, if the applicant's commercial reputation is a factor in the Minister's refusal to grant a licence, this fact will be provided to the unsuccessful applicant in the statement of reasons the Minister is required to provide under the Regulations (see Regulations 9(3), 15(4), 21(3) and 25(3)). The veracity of the Minister's reasons in this regard would be open to challenge by an unsuccessful applicant under Part 7 of the Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. Apart from the specific Regulations to which you refer (Regulations 10, 11, 19, 22 and 26), I do not believe there are a number of decisions provided for in the Regulations about which there is not a right of reconsideration and review under Part 7 of the Regulations. In relation to those specific Regulations, our legal advice is that, apart from Regulation 10, it is hard to see a person ever needing to exercise a specific right of review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under Regulations 11 and 19, the only possible decision the Minister (or delegate) might make is the date on which the licence comes into effect. Likewise, the only decision the Minister might have to make under Regulations 22 and 26 is to which region or regions the licence applies. Whilst it is possible an applicant may be aggrieved by these "conditions and restrictions" contained in the licence, there is a general right of reconsideration and review (under Subregulation 37(2)(a)) of such "conditions and restrictions" imposed by the Minister under Regulations 12, 17, 23 and 27.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to the review mechanisms provided by the Regulations, a person aggrieved by any of the Minister's (or delegate's) decisions may appeal on a question of law to the Federal Court under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whilst it is accepted that the Minister's decision under Subregulation 10(1) would more likely be a decision about which an applicant may be aggrieved, for the same reasons referred to above, it <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6740"> is not considered that a further avenue of review is required.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to Regulation 32 (suspension of licence), any suspension or variation is for a maximum of 28 days and is provided to enable the Minister to further investigate any reasonable grounds he or she has that non-compliance with licence conditions or restrictions has adversely affected, or threatens to adversely affect, the environment. lf during this limited time period the Minister finds the belief may not be valid, he or she must cancel the suspension or variation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, a person aggrieved by the Minister's (or delegate's) decision to suspend or vary a licence may appeal on a question of law to the Federal Court under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. In such circumstances it is considered that a specific review mechanism is not appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. For reasons similar to those given in section 2 above, a statement of reasons is not provided for in relation to Regulation 32. Further, under Regulation 32, the only lawful reason upon which the Minister can suspend or vary the licence is the adverse effect, or the threatened adverse effect, to the environment occasioned by the licence holder's non&hyphen;compliance with the licence. This makes the need for a statement of reasons redundant. In any event, a person affected by such a decision could obtain reasons by giving a notice under section 13 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similarly, although a statement of reasons is not provided for a decision under Regulation 31 to refuse to assign a licence, a person affected by such a decision could obtain reasons by giving a notice under section 28 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975, or under section 13 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4. Subregulation 36(4) requires the Minister to act on a request to reconsider certain decisions made by the Minister's delegate within 45 days of receipt of the request. This is considered to be a reasonable time limit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, a time limit on the making of original decisions (whether made by the Minister or the delegate) is not considered reasonable. The decision-maker has obligations under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 and the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975 (under which there are no time limits imposed on the Minister for the Environment or the Australian Heritage Commission) which may require him to consider comments from the Minister for the Environment and the AHC before a licence application is determined. If the Minister or delegate was forced to consider an application by virtue of a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> time limit, and did not have the aforementioned advice, he or she would have no choice but to refuse the application.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In any event, applicants may seek a Federal Court order requiring the Minister or delegate to make a decision under subsection 7(1) of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 if the applicant has concerns about the length of time taken.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5. The Regulations include similar powers of delegation as the Export Control (Unprocessed Wood) Regulations (which have been in operation since 1986), and most other regulations within the portfolio. Further, any action or decision by a delegate may be subject to reconsideration by the Minister or subject to review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or the Federal Court as described above.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I also note the effect of paragraph 34AB(c) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. Under that paragraph, if the Minister delegates a power under the regulations, the power, when exercised by the delegate is taken to have been exercised by the Minister. Therefore, it is in the Minister's interests to delegate only to suitable persons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6. With regard to your comments about the Explanatory Statement which accompanied the Regulations, whilst certain provisions deal with complex and "sensitive" matters, they are largely self-explanatory and implement the export regime clearly announced by the Government in July of this year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Regulations in large part adopt the same form and process provided under the recently disallowed Export Control (Hardwood Wood Chip) Regulations. Indeed, the bulk of the Regulations deal with established processes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, Parts 2 to 5 of the Regulations (dealing with the four different types of licences that may be granted by the Minister) mainly contain provisions which are repetitive of earlier provisions, and which again require little additional explanation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I trust my advice on the above matters will address the Committee's concerns in relation to the Regulations, and that the notice of motion to disallow the Regulations, introduced by Senator Colston on 6 November, will be withdrawn.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, should the Committee require additional advice or wish to discuss the above matters further, I or officers from my Department would be happy to meet with you at your earliest convenience.</PARA>

It is a bit odd that an exemption and a committee are going hand in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> hand.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 11 November 1996 the proposed referral to the Commonwealth by Victoria of the power to legislate over industrial relations matters in that State was jointly announced by the Honourable Peter Reith MP, Federal Minister for Industrial Relations; the Premier of Victoria, the Honourable Jeff Kennett; the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, the Honourable Mark Birrell; and the Victorian Minister with responsibility for public sector industrial relations, the Honourable Roger Hallam.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill gives effect to the undertakings made that day to provide a simpler, cooperative industrial relations system in Victoria which benefits employees and employers and the wider community. It relies on the referral of relevant matters to the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6743"> Parliament of the Commonwealth by Victoria's Commonwealth Powers (Industrial Relations) Bill 1996. This will allow the extended operation of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 in Victoria without the restrictions arising from the limits of power available under the Constitution. That wider operation will be in addition to the act's ordinary application.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth and State legislation marks a highly significant point in the evolution of Australian industrial relations. It is also a very substantial step forward in micro&hyphen;economic reform.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It demonstrates how State and Federal Governments can fundamentally transform the traditional relationship between their often competing jurisdictions to the immense benefit of the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Just as importantly, such reform helps businesses and workers to enjoy far more productive workplace relationships. The Victorian Government deserves full recognition of its willingness to take such a historic initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For too long, the Australian community has suffered from the collision of the Federal and State industrial relations systems. This rivalry has been at the expense of the efficiency of those systems, with consequent costs not just for the national and regional economies, but also for individual employers, workers and members of the wider community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill marks a transition to a new phase in State and Federal cooperation. The bill will make access to the federal system easier for Victorian industry and workers. The inevitable legalism and complications of industrial relations under the overlapping State and Commonwealth jurisdictions will be dramatically reduced. The artificiality of creating inter&hyphen;State disputes to attract the Federal jurisdiction will cease.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In short, these arrangements will do much to give employers and workers in Victoria greater control of their working relationships without the distractions and jurisdictional problems which occur where there are potentially two sets of rules relating to them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government hopes that the cooperation between the Commonwealth and Victoria will encourage other States to take similar action. This, however, is a matter for each State to consider in its own time and circumstances. Even so, there are very encouraging signs that other States also wish to work with us to improve the overall national system and to remove barriers to workplace flexibility and efficiency. This can be achieved by the creation of a single system, with its obvious immediate benefits, just as Victoria is doing, or by the harmonising of laws and practices and the sharing of resources, as we are seeing in other progressive States. In this context, I note the progress made by Queensland in reshaping its <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> industrial relations laws to complement those of the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All of this keeps the momentum up in the vital task of establishing a better framework for fair and productive industrial relations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I turn now to the specific provisions of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule 1 contains the amendments relating to the referral of matters by the Victorian Parliament, which will give wide legislative powers to the Commonwealth Parliament, subject only to a number of limited and specific exemptions in the State legislation from the referred matters. On Royal Assent to the bill, a new Part XV will be created in the Workplace Relations Act 1996. Division 1 of the new Part will provide a framework for additional provisions which will be inserted by proclamation of the remaining items in Schedule 1. This will enable the relevant provisions of this bill to commence with corresponding provisions under the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Act 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Division 2 of Part XV will extend the operation of the Commonwealth provisions concerning termination of employment, industrial disputes, certified agreements, Australian Workplace Agreements and freedom of association. These provisions will give the relevant parts of the Workplace Relations Act full operation in Victoria, for all employers and employees within the scope of the referred matters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Division 3 of Part XV will introduce new provisions, designed to maintain certain entitlements now given by the Employee Relations Act 1992 of Victoria. This is necessary to ensure that there is an effective transition to the Federal system. Neither the Commonwealth nor the Victorian governments would accept a situation where some people were left without proper protection of their basic entitlements. We have agreed on the creation of a safety net of protection for Victorian workers based on that given now by the State legislation. This will ensure that anyone who is not subject to a Federal award or agreement will be guaranteed an enforceable right to an up&hyphen;to&hyphen;date minimum wage and to certain basic leave entitlements. This will apply both to employees under employment agreements and employees under ordinary contracts of employment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In particular, the Workplace Relations Act will maintain the minimum conditions of employment which currently appear in Schedule 1 to the Employee Relations Act. These will be contained in a new Schedule 1A to the Workplace Relations Act. The Australian Industrial Relations Commission will become responsible for setting and periodically adjusting minimum wages, for employees not subject to a Federal award, certified agreement or AWA. This adjustment of minimum wages will be within the framework of industry sectors and work <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6744"> classifications which has been determined by the Employee Relations Commission of Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Again to ensure a minimum of disruption through the change in the system of industrial relations regulation, employment agreements under the State legislation will be given continuing operation.. However, no new agreements of that type will be able to be entered into.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The commitment of the parties to agreements which they have made under the State legislation will be recognised under the Workplace Relations Act, in the same way as for certified agreements and AWAs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The parties to a continuing collective employment agreement will only be able to take protected industrial action to secure a certified agreement or an AWA when it expires.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The parties to a continuing individual employment agreement will only be able to take protected industrial action for such purposes three years after the commencement of these provisions. This reflects the absence of any provision in the State legislation for the expiry of such agreements. It is also consistent with the life of agreements under the Workplace Relations Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These requirements will not apply to employers or employees under employment agreements which have been deemed to exist by the operation of the legislation, for example, after State awards were abolished. Moreover, there will be nothing to prevent parties to any form of continuing employment agreement from agreeing to enter certified agreements or AWAs whenever they so wish.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be an Inter&hyphen;Governmental Agreement between the Commonwealth and Victoria in relation to the implementation and maintenance of the new arrangements. This is expected to address consultation between the Governments on the operation of the legislative scheme and of the referral generally. The agreement may also address the necessary administrative arrangements, which are still under discussion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will briefly refer to the remaining provisions of the bill. Some technical amendments are proposed. These are not related to the referral of matters by the Victorian Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule 2 to the bill corrects a drafting oversight. The amendments to the Workplace Relations Act 1996 by that Schedule ensure that complementary State laws can confer power relating to the vetting of AWAs on the Commission, as well as on the Employment Advocate and authorised officers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule 3 to the bill adjusts the commencement provisions of the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Act 1996. The amendments enable Schedule 12 of that act (which establishes the no&hyphen;disadvantage test) to commence before the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> commencement of item 3 of Schedule 10 of that act (which establishes Australian Workplace Agreements). This in turn will enable the commencement of Schedule 8 (which makes fresh provision for certified agreements) independently of the commencement of the AWA provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate and present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>On 8 May 1996 the Senate resolved to appoint a select committee to inquire into a range of issues relating to casinos. The terms of reference for the committee were quite broad but focused in particular on the tendering process for the Victorian casino licence. The committee advertised, seeking submissions, in early June this year. It also wrote to approximately 100 individuals and organisations, including the Premier of Victoria, and invited them to make a submission.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Premier's response to the committee was highly uncooperative. He refused to make a submission to the committee and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the state of Victoria will assert its executive privilege against actions of the Commonwealth which threaten its autonomy or curtail its capacity to function effectively.</PARA>
<PARA>The committee was very disappointed at this response. It might have been expected that the Premier would welcome the opportunity to clear the air, but this was not the case. The Premier's lead was followed by many other Victorian state officials. One could well understand why this would be so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This lack of cooperation would have made it very difficult for the committee to inquire into the issues the Senate asked it to. The committee was therefore obliged to consider the use of its powers to send for and examine persons and documents. The committee decided to seek advice on its powers, particularly with regard to the summoning and questioning of both present and former members of state parliament, state government officials, cabinet ministers and their advisers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee sought and received advice on its legal position from both the Clerk of the Senate, Mr Harry Evans, and Professor Dennis Pearce from the ANU. They were able to provide the committee with much useful information and I would like to take this opportunity to thank both of them for the assistance they provided to the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, many of the issues canvassed in their advices have never come before a court. Although some guidance can be gained from previous judicial decisions, it is simply not possible to make a definitive statement about some of the Senate powers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will not attempt to set out all of the issues canvassed by the committee here. The advice received by the committee is reproduced in full and is extensively discussed in the committee's report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee conclusions about how legal restrictions on its powers relate to the current inquiry may be summarised as follows. Current members of the Victorian parliament could not be summoned to appear before the committee. The committee may not be able to use its coercive powers in relation to matters <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6746"> which are not within the legislative competence of the Commonwealth. Inquiries directed at paragraph (D)(1) of the committee's terms of reference might fall into this category. That is a significant term of reference that the committee was looking at.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The conclusions also say the committee probably cannot use its coercive powers to compel the answering of questions related to the preparation and presentation of advice to the Victorian government or into its cabinet processes. These legal restrictions placed considerable limitations on the ability of the committee to conduct its inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee also considered the question of comity between federal and state parliaments. It took the view that, in general, and independently of any consideration of the legal position, the following guidelines should be followed by Senate committees:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Current and former members of state parliaments should not be summoned or required to answer questions on matters which relate to their activities as members of parliament or ministers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Current and former senior public servants, ministerial advisers and members of statutory bodies should not be summoned or required to answer questions on matters which relate to their activities as advisers to state ministers or cabinet on policy issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The production of documents which were prepared for the purpose of informing, advising or decision making by state ministers or state cabinets should not be demanded.</PARA>
<PARA>Having settled on these guidelines, the committee decided that, while the issues it was pursuing were important, they did not justify overriding those guidelines and establishing a new precedent. As a consequence of the legal issues and the committee's adherence to the principles of comity, the committee decided that it was inappropriate to proceed with any public hearings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The links between then Premier Bjelke&hyphen;Petersen in Queensland and the white shoe brigade in Queensland were a national embarrassment to this country. I was surprised to discover in a sophisticated Melbourne that there is a state of fear and apprehension in that city. The information on the public record is sufficient to establish there is a case to answer surrounding the casino and all the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> issues that are involved. A proper inquiry will divulge more evidence of the abuse of proper process. There is no question about this. It is clear also that there is an incestuous relationship between the government of Victoria and some entrepreneurs. It is a most unusual thing and reminds one of what happened in Queensland years ago. I was surprised to realise that that exists in a cosmopolitan city like Melbourne, but it does exist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, the limits on the committee's powers have not allowed us to explore this relationship as we would have liked to, for the reasons that I have explained. Nevertheless, the committee recommends that a full judicial inquiry or royal commission into the tendering process for the Victorian Crown Casino be held, enabling issues relating to probity and the confidentiality of the tendering process to be investigated. That is a significant inquiry. We realise the gravity of that recommendation, but it is the only option any reasonable person who is not blinded by their political prejudice can come to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two distinguished former judges have summed up the situation. Both have extensive experience in reporting on casino issues. In his submission, Xavier Connor said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Hon. Sir Laurence Street AC, KCMG, a former Chief Justice of New South Wales, said that the holder of a casino licence should be `squeaky clean.'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I agree with this and so, I think, do most people who have made a study of casinos. Indeed, the statute, by necessary implication, requires it. Presently I do not see how the Victorian casino authority could possibly have categorised Mr Williams as squeaky clean nor Hudson Conway Pty Ltd while he had a dominant interest in that company. However, in a matter as serious as that, it is important not come to a final conclusion until the other side is heard. Until I have heard what the authority has to say for itself, I prefer to suspend judgment.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>That is the position. We were not able to have the inquiry as we would have liked. We were prevented from going to the evidence but there is no question what any reasonable person looking at what is on the public record will think&mdash;and of course we now know some of the things that people will raise if they can get a proper inquiry. That is one of the amazing things. Why I say there is a sense of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6747"> fear in Victoria is that people are frightened to come forward as they have been bludgeoned verbally into not coming forward because they fear for their employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So that is the atmosphere that exists at this moment. The only way that it can be resolved is a proper and formal judicial inquiry or royal commission to protect all the people involved, including the people who are being challenged in this case&mdash;the entrepreneurs close to the Victorian government&mdash;and also ordinary people who believe in the probity of the public service and who want to make sure that in their state the matter of a casino, a most controversial issue at the best of times, is handled in a way that will leave us with dignity, being examined by a proper body. So I commend the recommendation of the committee to the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have great pleasure in presenting the government senators' dissenting report on this inquiry, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A principled decision to wind up a politically motivated inquiry</EMPHASIS> . From the outset we should understand that with regard to this inquiry there has been, for the first part, no evidence. If, indeed, the committee wrote to over 100 individuals, as detailed by Senator Childs, why did not one single person&mdash;or very few of them&mdash;decide to come to the committee and present evidence? Why was there no response?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly there were legal restrictions in the sense that there should not be a compulsion for state parliamentarians or state public servants to necessarily appear before a Senate committee. But we should also go to the fact that most of the evidence provided for the allegations made in the majority report was provided in the Senate on 8 May in speeches made by Senator Carr and Senator Ray. Combined with the speeches of ex&hyphen;Senator Spindler, this is the basis on which the majority have decided to make their report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those who read the majority report will note that the non&hyphen;government senators and minor parties ignored the other terms of reference provided in the committee's terms of inquiry. They simply went for the jugular and decided to make this a political witch hunt into the Victorian government. The main <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> purpose of this inquiry was an attack on the Victorian government. The other terms of reference were simply dispensed with. To say that the committee were not able to deal with them meant that they did not wish to deal with them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The state government act of 1991 which provides for the Victorian Casino Control Authority makes provision for an inquiry to be conducted at intervals into its processes and operation and, as we have noted in our report, there is at present an inquiry going on into this. The authority embarked on its inquiry several months ago and it invited and received submissions from the public as part of that process. It is expected to report soon. Why, knowing this, would the non&hyphen;government parties expect to embark on an inquiry of their own which would simply duplicate the authority's inquiry? There is simply no reason for doing this and their report fails to offer any reason for doing that&mdash;and it fails to mention in any way, shape or form that very important provision of the Victorian government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government senators' report details the way in which there is no evidence. And, indeed, evidence was promised by Senator Woodley in his press release of 1 October in which he said, `We have a whole raft of documentary evidence to present.' Senator Woodley, where is that evidence? Certainly the committee are not aware of it and we would be very interested to see it. It is curious to see that Senator Woodley chose not to present any of it to the select committee. Several current and former Victorian state Labor members also claimed at various times to have evidence which would be useful to the committee. They or any other person who wished to present evidence to the committee was free to do so&mdash;and none did.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Childs, you have had a long and distinguished career in the Senate and you have always been an honourable senator. I am very sorry to see you, as chair of this committee, indulging in such a grubby political exercise and I note the hesitancy with which you presented your report. Possibly this is an indication of the fact that you know that it is fatally flawed in both fact and logic. I am <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6748"> pleased to hear you describe Melbourne as a sophisticated and cosmopolitan city, which indeed it is, but I would point out to you that the government senators simply cannot agree with the principles contained in this report. We describe it as a fatally flawed document. That is the reason we have released a dissenting report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I applaud the way principles of Senate committee behaviour have been laid out in your report but, unfortunately, the conclusions which you are led to by presenting some of those reasons are simply not borne out. As I said, the main purpose of this inquiry was a political attack on the Victorian government and the inquiry's other purported concerns were simply a facade.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If this was a political attack&mdash;and only that&mdash;then certainly we would have had Mr Ron Walker and Mr Williams before the committee for a political exercise. What this report demonstrates is that a Senate committee must abide by the higher principles of the Senate rather than just, as Senator Troeth would allege, political motive. In the 96 years of the Senate it had never been clearly laid down anywhere as to the powers of Senate committees and as to their limitations and relationships with state governments. It is true that there are traces and strands of views in a number of books and papers going back over many decades but no&hyphen;one had ever thought to bring all that together. A reading of the speeches when this committee was set up, even those who opposed setting up the committee, shows this was not elucidated and was barely mentioned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The great value of this report, putting aside the partisan arguments, is that, for the first time ever, a Senate committee has laid down what the relationship should be in terms of the powers of inquiry between federal parliament and state responsibility. We will not, I think, be able to accurately define when there is a severe overlap between the two. Nevertheless, Senator Childs and all the committee are to be congratulated on actually taking a principled position on this and laying down something that will be used by this chamber for many decades into the future.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Troeth invites us to produce evidence. I am happy to take you up on that, Senator Troeth. Next week I will come into this chamber with a whole range of documents and, naturally, you will talk to all your colleagues and you will seek their agreement to my tabling those documents in this chamber. I can tell you right now: you will not do so. You will do not do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The eventual recommendation of this committee is that, if we do not have sufficient powers to investigate this, we believe a independent judicial inquiry or royal commission should. It may well be argued that the only people excluded from giving evidence before this committee were current and ex&hyphen;state parliamentarians, public servants, statutory authority holders and employees, and police. At least half of the other witnesses could have been called. As I mentioned before, we could have turned it into a political circus and had Mr Walker and Mr Lloyd Williams along.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But this important principle must be established by this chamber, and I would say that, by the adoption of this report, it will: you cannot have two classes of citizens in this country. That is precisely what we would have done. We would have said all the police are exempt from giving evidence, all the employees of the casino authority are exempt, all politicians are exempt and all state public servants are exempt. If you do not happen to fall into that category, you could be subpoenaed and compulsorily forced to attend a committee hearing, and that, I do not believe, would be just. I think my colleagues took the view that that would not be just. Therefore, even if, as alleged by the government, there were political motivations here, in the end, principle well and truly prevailed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For all the smirking of those opposite, I can at least say that I am quite happy at any stage to pull out my ticket of the Victorian branch of the Labor Party and look on it with pride. How Senator Troeth and Senator Kemp and the rest can look on their own Liberal Party ticket with any pride whatsoever when you see what has occurred in their own state branch, what has occurred in the state of Victoria in regard to this casino licence, what <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6749"> has occurred there in terms of lack of probity and what has occurred there in terms of political corruption, remains an absolute disgrace. It is an absolute disgrace that can only be dealt with by a royal commission or by an independent inquiry.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every time you look at your Liberal Party Victorian branch ticket, look on it with shame. Look on it with shame. Look back at the Auditor-General's report in regard to an extension of the casino and how the public were ripped off by hundreds of million dollars. I wonder how, in the second round bid of the casino tendering, they managed to up their bid by $90 million? I wonder how they did that? What about the conflict of interest between the architects and the others that were doing business with Hudson Conway at the time? I wonder how Lloyd Williams survived the Paisley Street, South Yarra scam and the royal commission into the builders <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> labourers federation? What about the fact that he has twice had to be disciplined for breaching casino rules with Calcutta nights and minors on the premises?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a whole range of evidence. Those opposite ask: why was it not brought forward? The people I talked to all wanted to be compelled to come. They all wanted to be subpoenaed to come and give evidence there because of the climate of fear. Ask yourself about one of the biggest building companies that was called into the Victorian government and asked to shut up on this issue; otherwise their various road building contracts would be threatened in the state of Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is stuff out of the deep south&mdash;deep out of the corporate state of Louisiana in the 1930s. Jeff Kennett is a modern day Huey Long&mdash;deduct box and all. It is all very well for Senator Troeth and the rest of the Victorian Liberal Party to smirk. Yes, smirk away. But principle has triumphed over political expedience in this case. So it always should. Nothing will take away the stench that exists over the Victorian casino licence that has existed in that state year after year ever since Jeff Kennett got involved in this particular issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is one question I really would have liked to have asked in the committee. At the very time that Jeff Kennett was extending the casino licence, he was negotiating with Consolidated Press, who owned about a third of the casino at that stage, over a defamation settlement. Where is the conflict of interest rules there? How much money did Jeff Kennett get in that defamation settlement? It was rumoured to be a $400,000 settlement, at that very time he was making the person he settled with tens of millions of dollars by expanding the casino.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Jeff Kennett says, `The settlement's private, it can't be released.' It is in the public interest to release that sort of material so at least we know there is no connection between making tens of millions of dollars for one of the casino partners and a six&hyphen;figure defamation settlement. If the figure is $400,000, it is the highest private settlement that anyone has ever heard of in the state of Victoria.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6750">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly, when those matters go to the courts in Victoria, you are very lucky to get even a six&hyphen;figure sum, let alone $400,000. It may be normal in New South Wales; it is not in Victoria. Yet none of that has to be declared, none of that has to be brought out into the open because of the privacy aspects supposedly surrounding a defamation settlement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second area that I would have liked to have looked at is all those companies working on the casino site that just happen to be the same companies doing the various renovations to Jeff Kennett's home worth $300,000. How many of them did contra deals? All the rumours are there. So when the opposition come in here and smirk away, let them smirk. I can at least have pride in the political probity that we on this side of the chamber abide with. Those on that side generally abide with it at a federal level, but they are willing to tolerate it at a state level.</PARA></SPEECH>

<STATE> (Queensland)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(10.16 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me firstly address some remarks made by Senator Troeth. I was interested that she included the Democrats in the majority report. Obviously she has not read, or taken note, that the Democrats certainly made a dissenting report. I note, Senator Troeth, that you were prepared to quote a press report from last October. I must say to you, I am behind in my reading, but I am not that far behind. I certainly read the report, plus my dissenting report, and I have had a quick look at yours because, obviously, it is only available now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regarding the evidence that you required, you asked, `Why wasn't that presented?' Let me tell you what happened. There were a number of journalists in Queensland who followed this whole issue with great interest, who were ready to put on the record information and evidence which did not attack the Liberal Party&mdash;which, in fact, probably put the Labor Party in less than a favourable light&mdash;but they said to me, `We're not going to stick our necks out and risk our careers if the Liberal Party is going to shut down this inquiry.' Let us be quite honest about it, the Liberal Party made sure that this inquiry did not proceed, with the help of the Labor Party <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which, I think, went to water a little bit on this. At least that is what I would claim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that, faced with the whole issue of investigating all of the casinos in this country, the Labor Party was aware that perhaps it had some casino skeletons in its cupboard as well, and so it was prepared to support a most scurrilous attack by the Premier of Victoria on this inquiry, in which he was forced to withdraw the aspersions he cast on my colleague, Senator Spindler. I believe that it was the weakness of the Labor Party and the determination of the Liberal Party which ensured that this inquiry did not go ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was particularly interested in the fact that there are many unanswered questions about the Treasury Casino in Queensland. One of our terms of reference was to ask whether or not the overseas reputation of Australia had been damaged. Let me read from the US company Harrah's report into the Treasury Casino. They claimed in 1992:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is our view that, based upon what we know of the matter, the tendering process was not applied by the (Queensland) Government evenly among the various tenders for the (Treasury Casino) license, or consistently with the brief to applicants, including addenda, which the Government published and on which submissions were sought.</PARA>
<PARA>That company goes on to say, and this is on the public record:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . our unsatisfactory experience in connection with the Brisbane bid has resulted in a decision not to proceed with tenders for other available casino licenses in Australia, or, for that matter, any other business opportunities in Australia . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Was our overseas reputation damaged? It certainly was. That is not the Victorian casino; that is the Brisbane casino.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats want to say that this inquiry should have been opened up and it should have continued because there were many, many issues not just in Victoria but in other states which are part of the whole problem we have in this country with a growing casino culture, with a growing dependence of governments upon gambling revenue, which in the end is not only socially damaging but economically unsustainable as well. So that is why the Democrats have written a dissenting report and are very disappointed that the major parties saw fit to have this inquiry <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6751"> wound up. Let us make no mistake about it, the major criticism lies with the Liberal Party, who in this parliament decided they ought to protect their own party in the state of Victoria.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The majority report of the casino committee, Senator Troeth, found that the probe was hamstrung by the Victorian government's refusal to appear. They recommended that a full judicial inquiry or royal commission be held into the awarding of the Crown Casino licence. The Democrats agree with that. We certainly agree with parts of the majority report, and I make that clear right now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, we did not agree that there was sufficient reason not to continue with the inquiry, and I thought I made that clear all the way along. Certainly, you have criticised me, Senator Troeth, for saying that in the press. I accept that criticism, but I must say I was provoked at different times by what the Victorian Premier had said not only about my colleague, Senator Spindler, but also about the Democrats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that the shut down of this inquiry sets a dangerous precedent. I hear what Senator Ray has said, and I am sympathetic to some of what he said, but I believe it is a dangerous precedent for the Senate, which obviously now will cease even trying to subpoena public servants to give evidence before inquiries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where does that leave ordinary Australians? It means that powerful people within the political system in this country will be quarantined from the probing of this Senate. It means that they will have nowhere to go. We discovered that in the whistleblower inquiry. It was only Senate inquiry which enabled those people to be heard and which enabled them to continue their struggle for justice. If we remove this avenue from ordinary people, then they will continue to struggle against injustice whenever state jurisdictions want to make sure that inquiries by this Senate will not proceed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I enter this second reading debate in its dying moments&mdash;as I understand it, only three people are listed to speak. There have been considerable and well worthwhile contributions to the second reading debate. Feelings about this matter run very high; it is an important matter. I have had an enormous number of calls and correspondence about this matter, mostly against the one&hyphen;third sale. However, there has also been a number of thoughtful contributions from the public about why a third of Telstra or, indeed, the whole of Telstra should be sold.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even this morning, I received a telephone call on my message answering system from somebody in the outback of New South Wales who was concerned about the failure of Telstra to live up to its reputation and to serve the bush. That no doubt was an isolated matter. Nevertheless, it was of interest. For all of those who have contacted my office, I express my appreciation and hope they understand that it is impossible for me, with the very small number of staff that I have, to respond to them individually.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yes, feelings are running high about this matter. There is quite a lot of emotional support for Telstra. This, of course, is because of its history in Australia: it has been an organisation which has assisted in nation <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> building. Many people have worked for Telstra or its predecessor. In the 1950s I for one, for example, worked for a couple of years for Telstra which was then called the PMG's Department engineering division. I remember very well a number of those who were working at that time, including the father of one of the honourable senators here in this chamber. He was a remarkable man who had a high degree of commonsense and wisdom.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra is an organisation which the people have taken to heart. The threatened one&hyphen;third sale of Telstra has raised the spectre of unemployment. Jobs are being slashed from Telstra at the present moment, irrespective of whether there is going to be a one&hyphen;third sale. That is a result of preparation by Telstra for the deregulatory environment post&hyphen;July of next year. That is a matter that had been planned as a result of decisions taken by the previous government and by this government as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question of efficiency of Telstra is one that I have also had a good look at. The World Bank did do a study on the communications industry as to whether efficiency was affected by ownership. The answer generally was that, yes, it is affected by ownership if we are talking about underdeveloped countries. But with regard to developed countries, particularly those countries with a vigorous parliamentary democracy and a system of checks and balances, the World Bank report says that it is not necessarily ownership but structure and management that are the key factors. The government has a different view of that matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) will remember that I wrote to him on 2 September. I did get a shock as a matter of fact when I felt that the government was then saying that, although they were going to sell only one&hyphen;third of Telstra, that was likely to be a springboard for the sale of the whole of Telstra. I got a bit jittery about that. I know that other instrumentalities, other Australian icons like the Commonwealth Bank, have been sold&mdash;against my wishes, I point out. Senator Alston's comments drew the response of 2 <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6753"> September from me. I raised with him my concern that a one&hyphen;third sale of Telstra would be used as a springboard for the ultimate sale of Telstra; that even a one&hyphen;third sale might mean there was so much of an economic focus by Telstra that certain obligations that the old Telstra had towards regional and rural Australia would not be in the forefront of their mind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Among the matters of greatest concern to me was that Tasmania would be left in a communications backwater, that it would not be able to travel the communications highway&mdash;to mix metaphors. The question of jobs was, and is, also a matter of great concern. All right: the government had indicated&mdash;and I believed that this was the core undertaking; they tell us about mandates&mdash;that what they intended to do and what they said to the people that they would do is attempt to get $8 billion from a one&hyphen;third sale of Telstra to help to redeem debt with $7 billion and to establish the Natural Heritage Trust with $1 billion or a little more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to that matter, I believe that all of Australia should recognise&mdash;and the government on behalf of all of Australia should recognise&mdash;the pre&hyphen;eminent position of Tasmania's natural heritage. I know that the government has been giving very serious consideration indeed to that matter. I actually favour the establishment of a fund&mdash;whether or not it comes from the proceeds of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fund proposed by the government involves five key areas, including the natural vegetation initiative and the coast and clean seas initiative. As a matter of fact, disbursements from the fund for Tasmania according to its population do not work because, with regard, for example, to the coast and clean seas initiative, many honourable senators may not know that the coastline of Tasmania is longer than the coastlines of New South Wales and Victoria put together. There are numerous examples of that in the natural heritage area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The three other key areas are: land and water audit; national reserve system; and the Murray&hyphen;Darling 2001 project. The capital programs would be complemented by programs providing for land care, river care, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> world heritage management, farm forestry, a national weed strategy, feral animal control and a national wetlands strategy and so on. The `and so on' includes endangered species. In my letter to Senator Alston I indicated my concern that the government should, in disbursements from the Natural Heritage Trust, should it be established, recognise the pre&hyphen;eminence of Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My discussions with the government on that matter, and indeed on the other matters, have been courteous, amicable and fruitful, depending upon a confirmation of those matters. Confirmation of the areas has been given to me, but in general I believe it would be useful for the chamber to hear of those matters, which include the need to ensure that Tasmania does not become a communications backwater. The large cities will have the cable roll-out. That is not proposed for Tasmania at present, but there are other ways of achieving a suitable end result.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6754">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The remaining question that concerns me considerably is obtaining the $8 billion from a one&hyphen;third sale of Telstra by the issue of ordinary shares. I have proposed to the government in my letter that it should consider the issue of redeemable preference shares in a variety of ways. The government has been giving that proposal considerable thought. I believe that the one&hyphen;third sale of Telstra by ordinary shares would realise far more than the $8 billion that is suggested. An $8 billion one&hyphen;third sale presumes that the organisation is valued at $24 billion, whereas amongst the people whom I have had advice from I have heard no-one agree that it is worth only $24 billion. Madam Acting Deputy President, I seek leave to have incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> a brief back-of-the-envelope assessment that was done by my office which indicates that a one&hyphen;third sale could well yield $15 billion.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The day before yesterday the Treasurer (Mr Costello) sent me a letter which rejected the third proposal for <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> redeemable preference shares. In his letter he made a number of statements which I find extraordinary. The statements were based on <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> certain assumptions which are not necessarily to be made. One can make assumptions and then make comments upon those assumptions, but they are not necessarily the assumptions that I believe should be made. For example, paragraph 2 of the letter says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the outset, I note the importance of market signals in applying pressure for continuous improvement in the management of public sector trading enterprises such as Telstra. The partial sale of Telstra will significantly assist in achieving that goal.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is what the government is on about&mdash;that the partial sale of Telstra will boost the efficiency of the organisation substantially because it will have to react to changes in the market. Participating preference shares where the dividends vary with the ordinary dividend do have a fluctuating market value and do give market signals as to perceptions of management efficiency in so far as that contributes to increased profitability. So in that way in my view there is no difference, if that is the argument of the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can have a variety of hybrid preference shares. A substantial amount of material is available on this very issue. I did raise with the government my serious concern about a one&hyphen;third sale by ordinary shares because that will mean that a third of the underlying assets will be disposed of, whereas the redeemable preference share track would not entail a sale of a third of the assets. I am still very concerned about this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has given me nowhere to go in regard to the two other matters that I have been discussing with it. I hope that the government will confirm those matters in broad terms at the end of the second reading debate. However, I am still very concerned about this question of the one&hyphen;third sale. I know it is not the complete sale of Telstra. That cannot be done without the approval of the people at a future poll.</PARA>

<STATE> (Queensland)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(10.46 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is  debating today the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill 1996. The explanatory memorandum accompanying this bill states, amongst other things, that the principal purpose of the bill is to facilitate the sale of up to one-third of the Commonwealth's equity in Telstra Corporation Ltd.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The appearance of this bill did not take either house of the federal parliament by surprise. The possibility of its introduction was widely canvassed during the election campaign earlier this year. Indeed, the issue was a major plank in the policy of the then Howard opposition which was placed before the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The government's proposal to privatise one-third of Telstra should be considered against a background of previous sales of public assets in Australia. During the last decade and a half, the partial and complete privatisation of public assets has gained currency as a way in which governments can fulfil their spending priorities without raising taxes. These sales have usually been dressed up as a strategy to achieve philosophical objectives, such as the need for greater competition or the desirability of governments to leave business activity to the private sector and, where necessary, use their powers to regulate that activity. However, the true objectives in most cases have been to help balance budgets or to repatriate debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The Commonwealth has not been the only government in Australia to sell public assets. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> It is worth while reminding ourselves of some of the more significant sales undertaken by the states in the last decade or so. These are some examples of such sales: in New South Wales, the State Bank and the Government Cleaning Service; in Victoria, the Grain Elevators Board and the Port of Portland; in Queensland, Gladstone Power Station; and, in Western Australia, the State Government Insurance Office and State Print. In South Australia, there were sales of the Bank of South Australia and the State Clothing Corporation, and in Tasmania, Tasmanian Travel Centres and the Tasmanian Government Insurance Office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the Commonwealth level, governments prior to the Hawke and Keating era of 1983-96 did not hesitate to sell public assets. Some examples of such sales prior to 1983 include the Commonwealth Oil Refinery, half of which was formerly owned by the Commonwealth; the Commonwealth Engineering Company; Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia); the Australian Whaling Commission; the Australian Aluminium Production Commission; and, in the ACT, Belconnen Shopping Mall, Mugga Quarry and the Commonwealth Brickworks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the electorate is well aware, the previous Labor government had a reputation for pursuing a policy of privatisation. The fact that the sales in the period 1983 to 1996 comprise a lengthy list give some indication of the ardour with which that government engaged in the sale of assets to achieve its fiscal objectives. Some, but not all, of the previous Hawke and Keating Labor government asset sales include the Tokyo Embassy sale&hyphen;redevelopment project; Aussat Pty Ltd; the lease on Chifley Square in Sydney; the Williamstown dockyard; the Commonwealth phosphate stockpile; the Commonwealth Government Centre in Melbourne; the head of mission residence in Paris; the Defence Service Homes Corporation, the National Materials Handling Bureau; the Lindfield property in New South Wales; Film Australia; Australia House in Sydney; the Australian Defence Force home loans assistance scheme; housing loans assistance schemes in the Australian Capital Territory; and the sale of Australian Airlines to Qantas.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6756">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The year 1993 was a privatisation benchmark in Australia's economic history. The Commonwealth Bank's second share offer in 1993 was for only 19 per cent of the bank's share capital compared with the original offer of 30 per cent in 1991. Yet the second offer in 1993 was the largest ever government asset sale in Australia in terms of market value. It was the first open price tender offer and the first offer with dollar retail value applications. The sale of the 19 per cent share of the Commonwealth Bank raised $1.7 billion. But there was more that year. British Airways acquired 25 per cent of Qantas for $665 million, and AGL acquired 51 per cent of the Moomba-Sydney pipeline for $280 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The privatisation policy that began in the early 1980s and grew throughout the Hawke administration years developed into an art form during the era of the Keating government. The policy of privatisation was maintained in the years following 1993 with the sale of further assets, such as the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation Ltd, Aerospace Technologies of Australia and Commonwealth Serum Laboratories Ltd as well as the major assets of Qantas and the remainder of the  Moomba-Sydney pipeline. In addition, legislation was prepared to sell what was left of the Commonwealth Bank.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Notwithstanding the frequency with which assets were sold, the Labor government's program of privatisation did not prevent its re&hyphen;election in 1984, 1987, 1990 and 1993. It may be misleading to imply that these election results signified that the electorate accepted the then government's policy of privatisation, but it is certainly plain that the electorate did not consider privatisation to be so untenable as to vote the Labor government out of office. At worst, the electorate endured it. At best, it silently judged it to be a necessary and appropriate method of gaining government revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because privatisation had become a fact of life during Labor's 13&hyphen;year term of office, it was ironic that privatisation should become an election issue to distinguish the two major parties during the last election campaign. Although the matter was originally raised by the then coalition opposition, it became a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> central issue in the campaign due to the actions of the then Prime Minister, Mr Keating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 14 February 1996 Mr Keating, in launching the Labor Party's campaign in Melbourne, threw down the gauntlet to the electorate. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let's be clear about this. One party will sell Telstra if they win this election, the other party not. The coalition will sell it. The Labor Party will not.</PARA>
<PARA>Disregarding the error of syntax and the omission that the coalition planned to sell only one-third of Telstra's equity, it was a clear attempt to use the issue of a possible sale of Telstra to set the two major parties apart in terms of policy. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In view of the Labor government's pursuit of a policy of privatisation, observers could be forgiven for thinking that the then Prime Minister displayed less of a desire to retain public ownership of Telstra than the desire to have a real issue upon which to fight the election. Perhaps that is being unkind, but it was a clear reversal of policy for Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whatever the then Prime Minister's reason, the coalition canvassed its proposal for the partial sale of Telstra publicly and openly. On 18 February this year, the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard, formally launched the Liberal Party's campaign and formalised the coalition's commitment to the sale of one-third of Telstra. At the same time, he emphasised that two-thirds of Telstra would remain in government ownership, and that his government would legislate to prohibit timed local calls and maintain the existing price caps. He also made promises in respect of maintaining the community service obligations, to ensure that rural and regional Australia would receive fair and equitable services. The one-third sale was strategically linked to a $1 billion fund to be set aside for environmental projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The results of the election were quite clear. The electorate did not support the Keating government in its bid to retain office. Whether Telstra was uppermost in the electors' minds as they cast their votes is difficult to determine. Whatever is the case, with the coalition being returned with a clear majority of 40 over the combined total of Labor and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6757"> the independents in the House of Representatives, it is hard to argue that the coalition did not obtain a mandate to sell one-third of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are at least four principal justifications which are used by governments to rationalise their policies of privatisation. While I cannot give unqualified support for these reasons, it is pertinent to examine them. The first and most stated justification is that privatisation can provide fiscal relief for governments. It is not unfair to suggest that the privatisation program of the former Labor administration was one which was motivated largely by the government's desire to reduce its budget deficits. It was a policy which the Labor government chose to follow, regardless of the protests that it was `selling the family silver to pay the bills'. Nonetheless, there appears to be no hard evidence that the net impact from the sale of major assets by the previous Labor government has been detrimental to Australia's economic wellbeing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A second justification which is often proposed is that privatisation results in the improved efficiency of an enterprise, a notion which has its origins in the concept of competition. This argument suggests that the organisation strives for internal efficiency, driven by the competition of market forces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Third, those who support the sale of public assets suggest that this is justified on the basis that it enables national companies to engage in international economic integration. If this is so, it is worthy of consideration, as Australia strives to establish itself as a world class competitor in the field of telecommunications. Fourth, it is claimed that privatisation lends itself to another inclination of governments across the Western world; namely, the creation of what might be called the `shareholder' culture. As far as a partial sale of Telstra is concerned, there must be serious doubts that a majority of Telstra workers or their neighbours would be likely to be able to participate as shareholders in the floated part of Telstra. We should not deceive ourselves on this matter, because for many in the Australian community individual investment is a luxury.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other factors, of course, are important in this debate&mdash;factors such as the status of non-commercial benefits which are generally attributed to government owned business enterprises. There are justifiable concerns that non-commercial benefits or `social benefits' will be accorded a lower priority in an enterprise that pursues commercial gain with the single&hyphen;mindedness traditionally reserved for private enterprise. In this regard, the universal service obligations of Telstra constitute the most significant commitment by the organisation to the provision of `social' benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cross-subsidies which fund the universal service obligations facilitate the provision of a standard telephone service throughout Australia. It is a service targeted to the needs of people living across this vast continent and it provides the necessary telecommunications services essential for the conduct of everyday business. By guaranteeing access to untimed local calls, continuous access to the telephone network, emergency number facilities and operator assistance, Telstra is part and parcel of the standard of living enjoyed by ordinary Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> It is essential that the current commitment to remote areas is not diminished if a partial privatisation of Telstra goes ahead. My major concern is that the process of partial privatisation should not, as far as practically possible, result in job losses in regional areas. The economies of rural communities and regional cities are quite fragile in that there are fewer wage-earners sustaining them than there are in metropolitan areas. While a small change in employment numbers may be able to be accommodated in metropolitan areas, the same cannot occur in Australia's rural and regional areas. Our rural communities are too important for the wellbeing of the nation's economy to ignore what job losses will do to those communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I accept that there will be changes to the employment structures of large enterprises due to technological advancements, I do not consider it to be a foregone conclusion that some jobs have to be lost in the near future or that they have to be lost in large numbers in regional areas. It is part of the national character of telecommunications services in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6758"> this country that telephone operators have been located in regional centres, rather than in metropolitan areas. It is of no concern to telephone callers in Brisbane that their queries for subscribers' telephone numbers are attended to by operators hundreds of kilometres away. Because of past policies of decentralising these operator services away from major metropolitan areas, in some towns Telstra is a major employer. I cannot accept that the viability of these towns should be threatened because of a partial privatisation of Telstra. To be acceptable, the privatisation process has to reap benefits. There can be no benefits if a major source of employment is effectively moved from regional and rural areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I am mindful of the employment needs of other areas of Australia, but my principal responsibility is to the people of Queensland. In this respect, I believe at this stage I am close to negotiating a satisfactory resolution in relation to the employment opportunities for telephone operators in regional areas of Queensland. In addition, I have engaged in discussions on ways in which services to rural Queensland may be enhanced. I expect those negotiations could have a satisfactory outcome before the end of the committee stages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will, therefore, support the second reading of the bill, with the fall-back position that there is a further opportunity to vote against the measure at the third reading if the negotiations and discussions to which I have referred have not been satisfactorily concluded.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is now my pleasure to sum up a debate which undoubtedly has provoked fairly strong views on a variety of subjects, but the government's core position remains that telecommunications is one of the fastest growing sectors of the world economy. It is characterised by increasing levels of competitive, financial and technological risk.

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, the rest of the world can always be wrong and only we can be right, but none of the evidence suggests that. Both the majority and minority Senate committee reports concluded that there was scope for Telstra to improve its performance against a range of measures. There was extensive empirical and factual evidence that realisation of this improvement through increased efficiency would have substantial benefits for economic growth and consumer welfare.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will not rehearse all the arguments that have been gone through on many occasions in support of privatisation. However, I do want to deal briefly with three of the major claims that were made by the opposition in the Senate committee report: firstly, that it would undermine the universal service obligation; secondly, that it would involve selling off Australian assets to foreigners; and, thirdly, that it would weaken the industry development arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of the universal service obligation, the ownership of Telstra has no effect whatsoever on the universal service obligation. The government is committed to retaining the legislatively required USO; that is, the obligation to make the standard telephone service and payphones reasonably accessible to all Australians on an equitable basis. Austel has the necessary powers to enforce the USO, including the ability to direct Telstra to provide particular services under the USO.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consistent with the government's commitment, the level and quality of services provided under the USO is currently being examined under the review of the standard telephone service. The diversity of interests represented on the review will ensure that an appropriate balance is reached between the benefits and costs of any upgrade to the existing requirement for a 2,400 bits per second service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6759">  While in opposition, the coalition played a major role in highlighting the poor service being provided to Australians outside the major metropolitan areas. To address this, the government has decided to legislate for a customer service guarantee. The system which was put in place by our predecessors has not worked well enough and needs to be re inforced through specific obligations in legislation which cannot easily be watered down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has always intended that all carriers should be subject to a licence condition, to have an industry development plan and to report on progress with its implementation. It is nonsense to suggest that privatising Telstra will erode the value of such arrangements. Under the current industry arrangements, the privately owned carriers&mdash;Optus and Vodafone&mdash;are achieving higher Australian content than Telstra. In 1995-96, Optus had a local content of 73 per cent; Vodaphone, 67 per cent; compared with Telstra, 65 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The foreign ownership rules in the bill will mean that, even if foreign persons or foreign companies take up all the shares which are available to them, Telstra will remain over 88 per cent Australian owned. No individual foreign shareholder or associated group of shareholders will be able to hold more than 1.7 per cent of the company. The government will not allow Telstra to be owned or controlled by foreigners. The foreign ownership limits are supported by a range of enforcement provisions to ensure this commitment is met. With the requirements for incorporation, head office and base of operations to be in Australia, and for the chairman and the majority of directors to be Australian, decision making and control of strategic direction will remain firmly in Australian hands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's approach to telecommunications policy has properly been directed at ensuring that the benefits of reform are made available to all residents of Australia, both regional and metropolitan. The government is confident that a competitive telecommunications policy framework is most likely to provide the widest practical access to advanced services at the least cost to the community's resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The government recognises the particular problems confronting telecommunications users in regional and rural Australia and believes it has a special responsibility to assist such users to achieve equality of access to telecommunications services. For too long, particularly over the last 13 years, govern ments have been content to see non&hyphen;metropolitan Australia lagging well behind the capital cities in their access to high quality, state&hyphen;of&hyphen;the&hyphen;art communications services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Austel observed in November this year, in general the more remote parts of Australia have benefited last from the introduction of all types of new technology, and telecommunications has been no exception. Quality of service data collected by Austel consistently shows that service in non&hyphen;metropolitan areas is below that enjoyed by the cities. Again, according to Austel, rural communities in several parts of Australia have expressed concern that their services will not keep pace with improvements in the overall network and may even deteriorate. Rural communications users are also disadvantaged through higher call charges, less sophisticated network infrastructure and billing data, and longer waiting periods for telephone connections.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This situation cannot be allowed to continue. We have already taken some action to address these problems. For example, we have obtained from Telstra an agreement to accelerate effective completion of digitisation of its network by December 1998, and the extension of ISDN capability to 93.4 per cent of Australians within 90 days of request by 1 July 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But significant problems remain, and I acknowledge today the particular difficulties faced by Tasmania. Not only does Tasmania suffer from all the isolation problems arising from being divided from the mainland by a large waterway, but also it has more than half its population located outside the capital city. It has suffered for too long from the problems of an inferior telecommunications infrastructure. These problems are highlighted by its lack of access to new technology such as the broadband cable system which is being installed in areas of mainland Australia. In an age when a modern telecommunications infrastructure is becoming a prerequisite for business development, Tasmania is particularly vulnerable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the lead&hyphen;up to the March election, our policy commitments recognised that Tasmania had been systematically disadvantaged over many years and that specific action needed to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6760"> be taken to redress this problem. The government believes that the partial sale of Telstra and the proceeds that will flow from that sale provide a unique opportunity to improve communications for regional and rural communities in Tasmania, as well as other parts of Australia. For example, in the Northern Territory isolated Aboriginal communities require particular attention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Harradine quite rightly reminded me of his letter of 2 September in which he said that amongst the matters of greatest interest to him were whether state of the art technology could be guaranteed to regional Australia, including his state of Tasmania; whether Tasmania's natural heritage pre&hyphen;eminence would be properly recognised in the disbursement of funds from the Natural Heritage Fund, and some other matters which I do not need to address precisely at this point in time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also fair to say that a substantial portion of Senator Harradine's letter was concerned with the issue of redeemable preference shares and whether that was a route down which the government could go and still achieve its fundamental objectives. As Senator Harradine said, the letter he received from the Treasurer (Mr Costello) several days back pointed out the government's position at this point as not being in favour of that proposition, but we are prepared to examine the issue further. I understand Senator Harradine's concerns in relation to the issue and the need to have all of the possibilities fully explored, and we do agree that it would be appropriate for the issue to be referred to a Senate committee and for a report back to the parliament prior to 31 March, which would be our suggestion, and that there should be a delay in proclamation to accommodate that committee stage report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is certainly an issue that will provide the opportunity for a number of experts and interested parties to flesh out some of the arguments that Senator Harradine has put before the Senate and the public over recent months, and certainly I understand what he says in relation to the ability to have fluctuating dividends. The problem, I suppose, with that is that at times you can still maintain a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> consistent level of dividend, or even a higher level of dividend, even if your underlying profitability is not going up, but certainly I think it is worthy of further examination, as I have indicated, and we are prepared to consider it further on that basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam Acting Deputy President, accordingly, the government is prepared to commit $250 million from the proceeds of the partial sale of Telstra to create a regional telecommunications infrastructure fund which will operate over five years, and the money will be used to improve the quality of telecommunications services and to enhance employment opportunities in regional areas throughout Australia. The fund will directly improve the quality of telecommunications infrastructure in rural and regional areas, including the expansion of mobile phone coverage; will create employment opportunities in areas of high rural unemployment by assisting the establishment of customer call centres; assist community managed profit and non&hyphen;profit communications projects in regional areas; and establish additional Internet points of presence in regional areas to reduce or eliminate the STD charge associated with Internet access.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to directly assisting employment opportunities in regional Australia, the fund will enhance the competitiveness of regional businesses and enhance employment prospects by improving the access of regional Australia to state&hyphen;of&hyphen;the&hyphen;art telecommunications facilities. This initiative will be welcomed by all rural and regional communities, and is a further concrete expression of this government's determination to ensure that all Australians benefit from developments in communications technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also note in particular Senator Colston's comments about the validity of ensuring that people in rural and remote areas are not bypassed that there are some services that do not necessarily have to be located adjacent to the calling areas, and that in particular operator&hyphen;assisted services do provide opportunities to ensure that the level of employment in regional areas is not eroded. We will certainly be addressing those matters.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6761">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I say, in relation to the Natural Heritage Trust fund, that the government recognises more than ever the need to reinvest capital in Australia's natural heritage. The Natural Heritage Trust is an historic proposal, the most significant attempt to repair and conserve our natural environment ever by a Commonwealth government.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know it hurts. We recognise that it needed an input of significant capital. We found the way to do it&mdash;a reinvestment from the part sale of an asset to another asset, our natural capital. One billion dollars is a large amount of money, but the extent of the damage too is very great. Premier Court recently spoke about the enormous damage as a result of salination. He is absolutely right in respect of his state, but it is also a significant problem occurring elsewhere on a major scale.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rising water tables, salination, erosion, degraded creeks and inland waterways, damage to our coastline&mdash;the list is very long. So much so, we have decided to increase the contribution to the fund by another $100 million. The capital contribution from the sale to the environment will be $1.1 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Responding to Senator Harradine, we accept his argument. Tasmania is pre&hyphen;eminent in natural heritage. One third of Tasmania has been committed to national parks or conservation reserves, a much higher proportion than anywhere else in the country. To maintain this to the standard that all Australians expect is very expensive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tasmania has forgone economic potential in making the commitment to all Australians. Furthermore, Tasmania has significant unemployment problems, and tourism based on maintaining the quality of its natural heritage is vitally important. We can therefore assure Senator Harradine that these special issues which apply to Tasmania will be taken into account in the distribution of trust funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Harradine went out and fought vigorously for Tasmanian interests, and we accept the validity of his case. We have been working closely with the Tasmanian government to achieve a fair distribution of funds <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and we believe that the assurances we have been able to give the Tasmanian government will reflect a recognition and acceptance of the merits of Senator Harradine's arguments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, Australia needs a world&hyphen;class telecommunications system. Our future growth and prosperity depends on it. World&hyphen;class telecommunications systems can be provided only by world&hyphen;class telecommunications carriers. The corporatisation of Telstra, the introduction of limited competition, and advances in mobile and digital infrastructure have all contributed to better and cheaper telecommunications services. But you do not become world class and you certainly do not stay there by standing still.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is clearly something still missing. Telstra needs an infusion of private sector culture and capital. Telstra's management needs to know that every decision is being watched by investors who will dump them if they make the wrong decision. The whole company needs to know that there is no safety net.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government cannot guarantee that in an environment increasingly subject to competitive and technological risks that Telstra will grow and prosper. In the absence of private equity in Telstra, the risk that management will fail to respond effectively will be the greater and will be borne entirely by the taxpayer. If we do not take this opportunity now we will start the next century playing catch&hyphen;up while our major trading partners reap the rewards of having introduced varying degrees of private ownership into their communications carriers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not need to say yet again that not only is it our firm commitment not to go beyond one third without approval from the people at an election&mdash;unlike Mr Keating, who had no compunction about breaking those sorts of promises&mdash;but to do so would involve a change in this very legislation. This legislation ensures that, without the approval of the parliament, you could go no further and we have no intention of going any further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No convincing argument has been put forward on public policy grounds for retaining Telstra in full public ownership. The arguments come down to a resistance to change. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6762"> The real test of these arguments is that no Australian government of any persuasion would buy a telecommunications company today. In fact, you would be hard pressed to find a government anywhere in the world interested in buying a telecommunications company.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The partial sale of Telstra will also provide a unique opportunity to improve the communications services for rural Australia through the creation of a regional telecommunications infrastructure fund.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You might think we are talking just about Tasmania, but I can assure you that Queensland has a very high proportion of people outside major cities. There is a very large number of persons in areas of the state of Queensland in particular who will benefit from this proposal. It is a proposal that will benefit all Australians. It recognises that there is an imbalance that requires an approach that makes sure that all Australians benefit. I can assure you that those who have the largest claim will benefit the most.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We certainly accept the proposition that there are people, particularly in rural and remote parts of Queensland, for whom you would otherwise have concerns about loss of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> jobs.

I have to say that Senator Colston has made vigorous representations of behalf of Queensland, and it was open to any of those opposite to make similar representations on behalf of your constituents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If your constituents were not interested, that is your problem. They will be very annoyed. But they will also be very pleased when they see what we have been able to do for them despite your efforts. I assure you that those who have drawn particular problems to our attention have succeeded in demonstrating the validity of arguments in favour of ensuring people outside capital cities are not second&hyphen;class citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have not been prepared to put their interests where they ought to be. You have been prepared to see lags in services. You have not really cared if they are second&hyphen;class citizens because, basically, you write off the bush when it comes to elections. You think that as long as you stitch up the western suburbs and pander to a few of the middle class in the eastern suburbs, that will get you over the line.</PARA>

The Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston), in his summing up speech, outlined that that proposal had been accepted by the government and would be referred to a yet unnamed Senate committee which would report back in March next year and the bill, if carried by this parliament in the next week or so&mdash;or early next year&mdash;would not be proclaimed until the report of the Senate committee was tabled in the parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is an absolute joke. Does anyone believe, despite what the Senate committee may say, that this government will hold up the proclamation once they have got the bill <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6764"> through the parliament? Of course not. They say that to Senator Harradine who has laboured long and hard in trying to convince the opposition, the government and anybody else who will listen that his redeemable preference share option is the way to go to preserve Telstra in public ownership. The very least he should do is support the proposal by Senator Kernot that the bill not be proceeded with until the Senate report on all the aspects of redeemable preference shares comes back. That is the only way he is going to get any comfort at all on his own proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If Senator Harradine does not have that, we know what this government will do. They will say, `Fine, here is the Senate report. It is a wonderful idea. Tut, tut; we will proclaim it tomorrow.' That will be the end of the redeemable preference share proposal. It is a complete con on the Australian people, on the Senate and on the parliament to say that there is any way this is going to be seriously considered. The letter the Treasurer (Mr Costello) sent to Senator Harradine two days ago was a classically presumptuous letter from Treasury dismissing the idea&mdash;in a way that the Treasurer is so arrogantly now used to&mdash;of a redeemable preference share and saying, `Bad luck.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That letter had a number of errors, I remind Senator Harradine. Mr Costello, in his letter, said, `The redeemable preference share option was discussed in the Senate committee on Telstra earlier this year.' That is absolutely wrong. It was never discussed; it was not in the terms of reference and there was no discussion about it&mdash;and there were no recommendations made accordingly. But Mr Costello asserted that. We know that this is just a device to get the bill through the parliament and that the Senate hearing&mdash;whatever its recommendations&mdash;is going to have no bearing on the government's view. The proclamation will take place the day after the Senate committee reports. Do not let anyone on the other side&mdash;particularly the minister&mdash;say the minister is going to take any notice of the Senate committee. He will just say, `Tut, tut, bad luck, we have got the bill and it is going to be proclaimed,' and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> away we go with the process of selling one&hyphen;third of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is really an artificial device. What we see here today, as outlined by the minister, is coupled with the bribe of several hundred billion dollars to go into a fund. It is not said where it is going to come from other than that in one part of it $100 million apparently will come out of the Telstra sale. We have no indication of how they are going to fund the $300 million to Richard Court&mdash;as stated in a letter he wrote to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). All the figures on how they are going to pay for this extra funding have not been determined or explained. It is absolutely extraordinary that we are asked to say that there is a meaningful process for a Senate committee to consider Senator Harradine's process&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Harradine is taking the most extraordinary risk, given the position that he argued in his speech in the second reading debate just a few minutes ago. Senator Harradine, you have proposed that it is appropriate for the issue of redeemable preference shares to be examined by a Senate committee. The terms of reference of that committee, the nature of that committee, the composition of that committee and the time frame in which that committee will meet and report is still unknown to me and, I suspect, to the vast majority of senators in this chamber. If we had a situation where assent were not given to this bill after the bill had been read a third time, you would be taking on trust a government that has an unparalleled record of breaching its commitments, of breaking its promises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an extraordinary leap of faith for you to suggest that we can have a Senate committee inquiring into an important issue that you yourself, Senator Harradine, have identified as the most crucial one in this debate&mdash;that of redeemable preference shares in relation to Telstra&mdash;and have that committee report to the Senate on this matter after the bill has passed through the final stages in this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say&mdash;through you, Madam President&mdash;that you are, Senator Harradine, obviously as sophisticated about parliamentary processes as, if not more sophisticated than, anyone in this parliament, anyone in this chamber. What you are suggesting, what you are taking on trust, what you are taking on faith&mdash;the commitments that you accept from a government that has shown an unparalleled capacity to change its mind&mdash;is just extraordinary. It is an amazing leap of faith on your part, because once this bill has been read a third time then that is it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We said that we would set up, for the first time in the history of this country, a Natural Heritage Trust to reinvest some capital in another form of capital and that is natural capital.

But everyone now accepts that it will cost an enormous amount to put it right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact the major concern I get expressed when I go out and talk to environmental groups is that the money is not enough. You see, they are crying out for a reinvestment of this money. They are crying out for us to address the environmental degradation that has occurred that governments in the past have not been able to adequately address because they have not had a capital base for it. And we found a way of doing it. That is what so irritates the Labor Party&mdash;that we found a way of putting in place that capital fund that would give a really substantial money base to reinvest in natural capital to start to do something about the rising water tables, the increasing salinisation and, as Mr Court said&mdash;and I heard you deriding him&mdash;the huge trouble in Western Australia. What are the Western Australian senators saying about it? Do they have any idea what it would cost to overcome the problem of rising water tables and salt in Western Australia?

But Senator Colston said in his remarks that negotiations are continuing with the government about his concerns regarding rural employment. Then he made only an inference that his judgment could be affected if he wishes to vote; he still has an opportunity to vote in the third reading. But what we are saying here is that there is now a deal which the Senate chamber itself is not going to be apprised of.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It supposedly has nothing do with the Senate, and nothing do with the Parliament of Australia, but we now have a suggestion that there will be something <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> written down. I would have to say to Senator Colston and Senator Harradine: I trust you are not trusting enough to accept all of this on the word of the minister or the government without somewhere testing it in a document and in an amendment added to this bill, or even an amendment to the committee stage, that outlines your concerns and writes down the commitment the government made. Otherwise it is absolutely worthless.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real issue now is that, with the one&hyphen;third sale of Australia's biggest public asset, the Senate, the House of Representatives, the Australian Parliament, will not have any details written in about what is being done behind the scenes of the sale of Australia's biggest public asset. This is an astonishing new procedure. One would have thought that in the transparency of government and in the process this would actually be laid out. If it is not laid out as an amendment we might have got a suggestion that the minister would make a detailed statement that could be debated that lays out the detail of all these arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I took notes when Senator Harradine and Senator Colston were speaking and when the minister was replying, trying to work out exactly what the arrangements were that convinced the two Independent senators to vote for this second reading. In process this is a very slapdash way to treat the Senate. There might have been a press statement, a detailed statement put out to the public or tabled here so that we could examine it while this debate was before us in the committee stage. But that, apparently, is not on. The arrogance of the minister to say, `We have no amendments' but in his second reading speech to say, `We are going first of all to refer Senator Harradine's redeemable preference share proposal to a Senate committee'! He did not even tell us which Senate committee. He did not tell us whether it is a references committee or a legislation committee or one that covers communications, the economics committee or a select committee.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Apart from the committee, Senator Harradine, there are other matters I want to ask the minister about. Minister, in your remarks, you said: `There is a $250 million infrastructure program to guarantee that regional and rural Australia will have access to the most up-to-date communications systems.' We want to know: is that going to be a special appropriation? Is it going to be paid for out of the $8 billion sale or the one-third of privatisation? Is it going to be a levy on the carriers? Is it going to be funded as part of the universal service obligation?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How is the money going to be spent? Is it going to be spent at the direction of Telstra or at your direction through the Department of Communications and the Arts? Will there be any way for communities to apply to get access to this money? Will it be left purely to a bureaucrat either in Telstra or your own department to decide, or is it going to be left for you to decide? Have we got any detail yet on whether it is going to be dealing with cable roll&hyphen;out, the upgrading of telephone exchanges or the provision of satellite services? There is no detail on that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Again, we would have thought that that is not an unreasonable amount of detail to be put before us rather than have you saying, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> `Trust us. There are no amendments about it.' We would have thought that it is not unreasonable for the Australian people to know how the $250 million is going to be funded and put through. Is it a supplementary appropriation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of these things are unanswered. I am astonished that there is no indication, in any way, of how this is going to be done. I accept that maybe this has only been agreed with the Independent senators in the last few hours and that you have not got the detail prepared. However, that means even more that we should get more detail from you before we complete the committee stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is then the matter of the Natural Heritage Trust. Its funding is now going to be increased by an extra $100 million from $1 billion. Again, is the extra $100 million coming from the one&hyphen;third sale of Telstra? Is the $100 million coming off what was going to go towards paying off debt, so that it is reduced by $100 million? Is that going to be in a separate bill? Is that going to be an amendment to the Natural Heritage Trust legislation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have the implied suggestion that you accept that Senator Harradine from Tasmania has a particular case. I think you refer to Mr Richard Court's case for the salinity problems in Western Australia. How are you going to fund it? Are we going to get separate supplementary legislation coming through here? How will it be allocated? Are you going to allocate it? Will the committee that is going to run the trust fund allocate it? How will you guarantee that Senator Harradine gets a proportionate increase of the extra $100 million? Is all the $100 million going to Tasmania? Will it be available for discussion and debate in any form?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, if you do not want to amend the bill, you should at least give us a chance to receive a detailed statement in response to all these questions so that they can be properly debated before the committee stage of this bill is completed.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="ALSTON" NAMEID="LD4">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator Alston</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Why is that? Might it change your vote?</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6772"></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It certainly will not change my vote about the principle of selling Telstra. However, in terms of good government and Senate process&mdash;you may not now be committed to this, but when you were in opposition you kept screaming about these things&mdash;I would have thought it was to your advantage to give us the detail. If we then find that some of these so&hyphen;called commitments are a bit `hairy fairy', we might well say to Senator Harradine or even Senator Colston, `Listen. We think you ought to put an amendment in this bill so that this money will turn up and be allocated in the way that you want to meet the commitment.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the opposition wants to do&mdash;you may well get away with it if Senator Colston and Senator Harradine are willing to go along with it&mdash;is to have some arrangement off the side with them but not here on the floor of the Senate. It is not unreasonable to expect the detail of this extra arrangement to be described here today in the minister's summing up. He should outline to the Senate how it will be handled. If the Senate has a majority view that this ought to be written into legislation to protect the arrangement that Senator Harradine was very keen to get, that is fine. However, let us at least have a debate about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that the minister wants to get through the committee stage on a blink so that there is no chance for any senators, including the Independent senators, to move amendments to guarantee the arrangements they want. At the moment, a $250 million fund for telecommunications infrastructure in rural and regional Australia is no guarantee that Tasmania or anywhere else in Australia will get equal access to it. You have not given us any detail. I do not think it is unreasonable to say that you should write that into this bill, at least as a general amendment to describe the process. In that way, your concern about regional and rural Australia would actually be met.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are details in the committee stage that ought to be discussed. The opposition will in principle absolutely vote against this bill, as we have in the second reading. We will vote against it in the third reading. We will call a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> division on it in the third reading. Our principal position is that we are against it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, the minister made remarks about a conversation I had with him a couple of days ago when he approached me in the chamber about whether I had any amendments. If private conversations are going to suddenly be dropped on to the floor of the Senate whereby what I said is reported, there will be no more private conversations. I do not mind the minister's getting up and giving his view about this or that. I put to him my proposition that the other bill on telecommunications deregulation should go to a Senate committee. However, I did not say what his response was; that was up to him to give.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think it is very good process to suddenly say, `The shadow minister did not have any amendments. He said that he did not know.' At that stage, and up until the vote was taken, we were absolutely committed to doing only one thing, which was defeating this on the second reading. If we had indicated that we had a great list of amendments, you would have then jumped up and down and leaked it to the press that we were already conceding our loss on the second reading. If the minister wants to have a trusting and honest discussion across the chamber, which I am more than happy to have in order to facilitate the sensible working of the Senate, I will be in it. However, I will not be in it when, in order to make a political point, he gets up and gives his version of what I said. That means there is no trust, and he will never be able to have a private discussion with me again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have gone out of my way, on behalf of the opposition, to facilitate the post 1 July 1997 legislation being considered by this Senate in a timely way. If you want to have a mayhem process, you know as well as I do that when that bill comes in, in the committee stage we will hang you out to dry for weeks and weeks and weeks. I have not ever threatened that, but if you start breaking informal conversations where people are honestly trying to work out a better process, you're in for a terrible time. I just want to put that on the record.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition is obviously very concerned about the developments that have taken place here today. We are particularly concerned that there should be a proposition put to us that we engage in debate on issues for which we do not see the detail. We cannot see the detail, because no detail has been produced. We have some woolly statements based on some very woolly commitments about issues of employment. There are also some issues concerning the environment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are told that some undertakings have been given to protect regional employment. Let me deal with that issue first. Was it not the government's case throughout this whole process to argue that the basis for privatisation was one of efficiency? Blow the social costs and blow the economic implications at a regional level, because what it was all about was efficiency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do you remember all those fantastic graphs about the number of lines per employee and that under privatisation we would be able to reach world's best practice? We could measure it against this mythical company in the United States and, according to this model, we could demonstrate that, if we privatised Telstra, we would see an improvement in efficiency but the consequences that would flow would be a loss of jobs and a loss of social infrastructure at a regional level. We were told that does not matter because there is an overriding criterion&mdash;that of efficiency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But now we are told there are some arrangements to be put in place to look after this little patch of employees or that little patch of employees in such a manner as to ensure that the political interests of some Australians are to be protected, that the social interests of some Australians are to be protected and that the economic interests of some Australians are to be protected at the expense of other Australians. The fundamental discrimination that is involved in this measure should not be misunderstood for one moment.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a fundamental hypocrisy for this government to argue, on the one hand, we should do this on the basis of efficiency and then, on the other hand, to secure a couple of votes say we will make sure some Australians are given privileges that other Australians do not enjoy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen a business plan put forward by Telstra which sees one-third of the company out the door on the basis of efficiency. Remember that argument? We said all along that it was in preparation for the privatisation process. We said all along that, on the basis of the Project Mercury documents&mdash;the documentary evidence we had&mdash;and the minutes of those meetings, there was no doubt whatsoever that what was going on inside Telstra was that the adherence to government policy by the management of Telstra was already having a distorting effect on the company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We made it perfectly clear what our position was. This government said, `No, it has nothing to do with any of those political considerations. We're going to have a higher form of economic morality. We're going to base our decisions on efficiency. We're not going to be concerned about the social or the economic consequences of our decision. We're going to be concerned with one thing: the saving of $600 million off the bottom line by the throwing of one-third of the workers in Telstra out the door.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6775"> We hear today that there are going to be some special arrangements put in place so that the people of Roma, presumably, can keep their operator exchange services. I am very concerned about the people of Roma but I am also very concerned about the 60 other operator exchange services across this nation. I am very concerned not just for the people of Tasmania, not just for the people of Queensland&mdash;some people in Queensland and some people in Tasmania&mdash;but for the people of Victoria, of South Australia, of Western Australia, of New South Wales and, of course, the people in the territories. We have to consider their interests as well, I would have thought, if we were a national parliament&mdash;not a parliament put together on the basis of a holding together alliance; an alli ance of convenience to ensure some Australians are given protection at the expense of other Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Victoria at the moment there are some 22,000 Telstra employees. Under the projects that are being initiated by Telstra management, the management initiated redundancy programs, Victorians are going to be hit the hardest. Why should they suffer at a greater rate than the workers in Tasmania or in Queensland? What is the moral justification for that attitude? Of course, there is no economic justification for it. What is the moral justification for it? There is none there either.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is so fundamental about this government is that it is completely amoral. It is amoral in its approach to politics because it does not matter what it says; it does not matter what it says because it does not really mean what it says. It is the end objective that matters&mdash;the end justifies the means. As far as this minister is concerned, it does not matter what you do to get there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fundamental immorality of this government is being exposed here today. We think it is reasonable that, if these measures are to be adequately considered by the parliament, we at least see what they say in writing, because this government's word cannot be believed and should not be believed. There is no basis for anyone to believe what this government says. It is not worth a blob of glue. This government has no commitment to honesty and decency in public life because it is about getting the end result, which is, of course&mdash;we all understand on this side, in any event&mdash;the full privatisation of Telstra. There ought to be no illusions about what this is about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were told that, somehow or other, the 1,500 workers in Tasmania should be given additional protection. I agree they ought to be, but so should the 22,000 workers in Victoria, so should the 12,000 workers in Queensland, so should the 5,000 workers in South Australia and so should the 6,000 workers in Western Australia. What is to happen to them under this proposal?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> If we are talking about the removal of one-third of workers out of Telstra to justify the reshaped corporate entity to meet the require ments of CS First Boston Group in terms of any prospectus, what does this measure really mean for the workers in Western Australia? Does it mean that they have to carry a disproportionate burden? I think there is only one conclusion you could reach. This government is not talking about putting more people on the payroll; they are talking about removal of people from the payroll. Therefore, one must conclude that the workers in the Australian Capital Territory will have to pay more dearly as a result of this deal, that the workers in the Northern Territory will have to pay more dearly as a result of this deal and, of course, that the workers in Victoria will suffer very dearly indeed. This is what this is all about&mdash;fundamental discrimination and immorality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We get to the issue of the provisions for an environment fund. I would have thought it obscene to distribute money on the basis of political advantage measured by the numbers of votes that you can gather in this chamber. I would have thought it was fundamentally constitutionally improper to give special advantage to some citizens over others. Therefore, we suggest that if it is wrong to privatise the corporation, then it is doubly wrong to privatise the corporation on the basis of a political bribe to some parts of the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that it is totally inappropriate for an immoral adventure like this not to be challenged at every possible opportunity, and that is what we intend to do. I think there ought to be a rational assessment of the way in which moneys are distributed in this parliament. There ought to be a clear and transparent method for the distribution of public funds. There ought to be political accountability. These are some of the fundamentals, I would have thought, of public administration. But we are seeing that thrown out the window by these measures. What this means is that you slip in the back door and arrange a special deal on the side. That is the principle we are enshrining here today. It seems to me that this is not the proper way for us to proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think there is a legitimate case for moneys to go to Tasmanian national parks, but there are legitimate reasons as well for moneys to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6776"> go to national parks in Victoria, legitimate reasons for wilderness areas in Queensland to be protected and legitimate reasons for conservation measures to be undertaken in the Northern Territory. If salinity is important in Western Australia, why isn't it important in the Murray Valley in Victoria? Why are the homes, the towns and the regions of Victoria not just as important as the regions of Western Australia? For that matter, why is it that they should be treated as second&hyphen;class citizens by this government because of these arrangements they are entering into&mdash;arrangements we cannot see, where there is no transparency, no accountability and no way of judging what arrangements have been made other than with broad and woolly&hyphen;minded commitments that we have heard here today?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It strikes me as extraordinary that Senator Harradine, with all his experience, should not be able to put to us a position that says, `This bill, on the arrangements I have made, won't be put into law until we have some commitments about certain matters.' I would have thought it was fundamental to any political deal making. But what have we here? We have a proposition that says that if this bill is read a third time it will not pass into law unless the government agrees with the report from a committee&mdash;but it is unspecified. Do you expect us to accept that as a reasonable course of action?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that we would have to be extraordinarily gullible to believe for a moment that this government is other than committed to the full privatisation of Telstra&mdash;or, for that matter, when it gets to the third reading on this particular stage of that privatisation process, should it achieve a third reading by this parliament, that it will not proceed with the sale in terms of the bill. To suggest otherwise I find quite extraordinary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I think we come back to this. We find that the fundamental principles remain the same. There is no justification for the privatisation of Telstra. There never has been justification for the privatisation of Telstra, other than at the rhetorical level. The empirical evidence simply does not support it. What have we got on top of that now? We have the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> justification based on special arrangements entered into for special regions in Australia. We have a basis of discrimination introduced as a means by which we legislate in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra is one of the greatest assets this country has ever produced. It is an asset that has taken 100 years to develop. It is an asset that is far too valuable to sell and it is being sold off on the basis of this tawdry arrangement. I find it an extraordinary proposition that the parliament could possibly agree to such a thing, that in this day and age a new morality is being entered into, a brave new world of Australian politics where you find the truth is not as it at first seems. This is our giant <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">X Files</EMPHASIS> here, isn't it? I think we can expect much more to come from this government, and we should not be under any illusion as to what the true nature of these arrangements is.</PARA></SPEECH>

That is not the basis of good negotiation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I guess one could argue that the Senate is the states' house. Perhaps Senator Harradine and Senator Colston could find some argument there. But the problem with that argument in the case of this Telstra bill is that the impact of this bill affects every Australian, no matter where they live. That is why it is absolutely wrong to single out Tasmanians or Queenslanders in Roma or anybody else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my view, what we are seeing&mdash;and we have not seen the detail&mdash;is equivalent to the worst form of American pork&hyphen;barrelling, vote buying, that Australians usually show a great deal of disdain for. We do not want this American style of parochial vote buying&mdash;trade&hyphen;off a little bit, forget about the common good. We do not want that in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the matter of what is being traded, I know we were criticised for our industrial relations negotiations. But I can tell you this: you had on the table a very comprehensive <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6777"> document which had, word for word, what we agreed to. We started with a couple of things in common. We did not say, `Oh, and we want $100 million here', or `We want this done for workers there.' We did not say that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There seems to be a recurring theme in this place, because here we are again debating another piece of anti&hyphen;family legislation from this government. The Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill (1996), with the child care regulations passed last week and the appropriation bills, signal the end of child care as we know it in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These measures attack the very core of the child&hyphen;care system that was built up by Labor over the last 15 years. Taken together, the coalition's cuts to child care mean that Australian parents will have to find an extra $&half; billion over the next four years to pay for child care. That is $&half; billion from family budgets which are already tight and which <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will become much tighter after the Howard government's budget cuts really start to bite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's child&hyphen;care system was one of the best in the world. I do not stand up here and say that it was perfect, but our record speaks for itself in child care. Our child&hyphen;care system was built on the Labor Party's commitment and belief that child care should be treated with the same seriousness as education and aged care. With that level of commitment, we built a $1 billion child&hyphen;care program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fifteen years ago, when the crew opposite were last in office, there were just 47,000 child&hyphen;care places nationally. Opportunities for women to take up work or study were limited because there was not enough child care available, or because the little child care that was there was so expensive. But Labor delivered on its commitments over its 13 years in office. Thanks to Labor, more than 440,000 families now use Commonwealth funded child&hyphen;care services in any one week, both work related and occasional care. The coalition does not share that level of commitment, and this legislation stands as testimony to that lack of commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On this side of the chamber, we believe that quality, affordable child care is the greatest support we can give families to help them balance their work and family responsibilities and support the parents at home who want occasional or pre&hyphen;school care for their children. One of the ways we delivered that was through operational subsidies for community based long day care, investing in public infrastructure to invest in our children&mdash;not through weasel words, such as those used by the coalition. This legislation abolishes the operational subsidy for community based long day care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me quote from the Department of Health and Family Services portfolio budget statement to give the government's primary justification for the abolition of operational subsidies for community based long day care. It says that this abolition will `encourage services to become more efficient and cost competitive with the private sector'. But as our dissenting committee report on the Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill states, that is the level playing field argument of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6778"> economic rationalists, the argument put by the National Commission of Audit for the abolition of all operational subsidies for community based services, and the principle underpinning the work of the Economic Planning Advisory Commission's child&hyphen;care task force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said in this chamber the other day, the bottom line is that children are not commodities to be traded for profit. The dismantling of our social infrastructure which will arise from this proposal is far too high a cost to pay for efficiency and cost competitiveness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The submissions that the committee received on this legislation paint a very unhappy picture of community based long day care after the abolition of the operational subsidies. There is no doubt in our minds that fees for child care in these centres will be higher&mdash;in the order of $25 a week per child&mdash;as a result of this measure. And there is no doubt in our minds that the quality of care provided by these centres will be reduced as a result of this measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The submissions received by the committee reveal some of the cost cutting options that have been canvassed by centres as a result of the axing of the operational subsidy. They reveal a very concerning list of issues. They include: employing fewer staff or taking on more children so that staff&hyphen;child ratios are lower; employing younger, less experienced and less highly qualified staff; restricting staff training and development opportunities; and requiring staff and/or parents to take on responsibility for cleaning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They also include: deferring the replacement or buying of equipment, such as toys, books and the like; no longer providing educational program enhancements, like music classes or excursions; no longer providing hot meals, instead asking parents to provide meals from home; no longer providing a nappy service, instead asking parents to provide disposable nappies; providing fewer places for babies; providing fewer places for children with special needs; amalgamating with other centres; and, of course, closing. I find it very hard to see how these sorts of results line up with the coalition's commitments to deliver to all families and provide choice for families.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation does not stop at axing operational subsidies. For those families that do not qualify for the family tax initiative&mdash;the coalition's smokescreen for all their other cuts to families&mdash;their child&hyphen;care cash rebate has been slashed by one&hyphen;third. The introduction of the child&hyphen;care cash rebate by Labor recognised child&hyphen;care costs as a work related expense. Child&hyphen;care costs can be a significant disincentive for women thinking about taking up employment. Like other tax concessions for work related expenses, the rebate was not means tested.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now, despite a specific promise not to do so from this deceitful government, this legislation applies a means test to the child&hyphen;care cash rebate. Families stand to lose up to $9.60 per week if they have one child in care or up to $21.10 if they have two or more children in child care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to remind the Senate that this legislation affects only two of those measures that I have previously identified in the Senate that really rip the heart out of our child&hyphen;care system. Now 5,500 community based long day care places and employer sponsored centre based places will not be built because we have this family&hyphen;friendly government axing the funding for them. John Howard promised to support the creation of additional places to meet the current unmet demand for child care. Instead, we are a further 5,500 places behind Labor's goal of meeting demand by the year 2001. We have no evidence that the private sector will build these places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do not forget that the changes to child&hyphen;care assistance&mdash;which many know as fee relief&mdash;which went through this place just last week mean that all parents will have higher out&hyphen;of&hyphen;pocket expenses for child care. The government has already passed guidelines which freeze the maximum amount of child&hyphen;care assistance that a family can get at today's maximum amount until 1999. With inflation, child&hyphen;care fees will increase over the next three years. Fees are likely to rise over and above inflation, but the amount of help a family can get will be frozen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The maximum amount of child&hyphen;care assistance has been frozen, but the minimum fee that parents have to pay for their child care is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6779"> not frozen. The minimum fee will increase annually. Some $85 million over the next four years has been slashed from child&hyphen;care assistance by this government, increasing the cost of child care for some 330,000 Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The $30 child income disregard allowed under the child&hyphen; care assistance income test has been abolished. All families with two or more children, at least one of whom is in child care, lose under this measure. It is a savings measure which is specifically targeted at families with two or more children. The savings come from paying less child&hyphen;care assistance to families with two or more children where at least one of those children is in child care. It is a measure that will take $77 million out of the pockets of families over the next four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The child&hyphen;care assistance income cut&hyphen;offs for families who have more than one child in child care have also been reduced. On the face of it, this is perhaps a measure that one could understand the government reluctantly adopting in a climate of fiscal restraint. But I want to make the point that it is not only higher income families that are going to be affected by this measure. The manner in which the cut&hyphen;offs are being reduced means that all families with incomes above the point at which child&hyphen;care assistance starts to be withdrawn will be affected by the measure. Any family with two or more children in child care and with an income over about $27,000 a year will get less child&hyphen;care assistance as a result of this budget measure. As I said last week, there is definitely a recurring theme in this government's approach. This is a measure which penalises families who have more than one child in child care and takes another $13 million out of their pockets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I keep saying, and will continue to say, John Howard's so&hyphen;called family budget, with its family tax initiative as its centrepiece, is slowly but surely unravelling. It is slowly but surely being exposed. John Howard wooed families in the election with his family tax initiative, but as you add up the numbers you can see that the small benefits of the family tax initiative will be given to families with the one hand but taken away with the other. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> There is no more marked example of this than on the issue of child care and in the case of families, particularly families that depend on child care. Any bonus in the family tax initiative for them is gone.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also rise to support Labor's approach to child care in Australia. I want to remind honourable senators of how we got to this point of actually debating such <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> massive cuts to such a fundamental service to Australian families. We got to this point because the government has done its utmost to dress up unjustified cuts in its expenditure and has applied them, in seeking to find some savings, to the most inappropriate areas. One of the most inappropriate areas is the subsidisation of community based child care.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For so many families in Australia, child care is a prerequisite to their considerations in entering the work force. It is not just that there should be an option and a number of ways that they can obtain child care. For people to actually head out into the work force after having had children or contemplated having children in their lives, quality, affordable, accessible care is a prerequisite. If people cannot be confident that the government is at least contributing towards providing those choices and that care, what on earth are women and men going to base their life decisions on with regard to how they are going to structure their families and work that in with when they get their mortgage? And how are both going to afford to be able to work and have a family at the same time?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can speak from experience on this, because I distinctly remember the day that I made the choice, when I was 22, that I wanted to do both. I wanted to have children and I wanted to have a career; and, because of Labor's policies, I was able to make a choice and know that, if I chose to keep working, I would be able to find for my child quality care close to home that was affordable, accessible and good, and that I could have confidence in that care. What this government is proposing to do is to take away that choice from women like me who make those choices in their early 20s or late teens or whenever. It is basically an anti&hyphen;family policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sick to death of hearing the government use the word `family', when every day I sit in this chamber and see piece of legislation after piece of legislation that Labor put in place going down. The government is making that legislation go down, and is amending and changing it under the guise of savings on expenditure, but what they are doing is breaking down the social support structures that Labor has systematically put in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6781"> place over the past 13 years. It has been a system that, I have to say, before I came to this place I had started to take for granted. I had started to think that Australia did have a solid base from which families could work and within which families could operate and make their life choices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I supposed that, given the coalition's rhetoric leading up to the last election, that system was the base from which we were working as a society. So it was with great devastation that I, along with most of the population, realised that a lot of what we had heard from this government in fact had no bearing on working from the base that Labor had established. What we heard had no meaning and no substance, and there was certainly no inclination on the part of this government actually to continue working from that base. We have seen a systematic erosion of the base that Labor put in place for families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Child care remains a significant cost for most families. If you have more than one child in care, the cost usually outstrips your mortgage repayment. When we talk about child care, operational subsidies, child&hyphen;care assistance or the child&hyphen;care rebate, we are talking about major impacts on the family budget. It is not just a sideline couple of dollars per week, although the couple of dollars per week are important too. It is a major weekly expense for families. Certainly, with the first set of amendments that this government pushed through last week with respect to the changes to child&hyphen;care assistance, we have had a sniff of what is to come.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are talking about today, with this government attempting to abolish operational subsidies to community based day care, is the next step&mdash;and there are still a number of steps to go. As Senator Faulkner said, the result is half a billion dollars worth of money being ripped out of families' pockets&mdash;families for whom a significant cost in their weekly budget is, more than likely, child care. The operational subsidies themselves represent a proportion of that money that has been taken out of family pockets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn now to the more specific applications of those operational subsidies. The operational subsidies apply to 1,112 centres around <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australia, probably just under half of how many private centres are around. While there is a perception out there that these centres are somehow poorly run, inefficient and bloated through this government subsidy, that is an absolute farce. In fact, what it means is that the parents who have their children in those centres may have a slightly less fee&hyphen;paying arrangement but, in my pursuit of looking for adequate care for my children, the difference was $20 to $25 a week per child in the cost of care. The operational subsidies in the community based centres also operate on the basis of a parent and staff management committee. So what this government is subsidising is the role and the right of parents and staff to actually control the environment in which their children are cared for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we had the hearings the other day of the Community Affairs Legislation Committee in addressing this specific bill, the question was asked: had the department ever factored in the costs or the value of the contribution that the parents were making to the management and the running of these operational centres? Had they factored in the costs or the value of the contribution the staff were making to the management of their centres? No, of course not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I ask all honourable senators what value they put on the role of parents in having a say and putting in their own time to run and manage a community based child&hyphen;care centre. What is that worth&mdash;not only in a monetary sense about the time and effort&mdash;in terms of the quality and the peace of mind that that gives parents? The choices of having this option available to parents cannot be emphasised enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst a proportion of community based child&hyphen;care centres attract this operational subsidy now&mdash;and there is a greater proportion of private centres&mdash;it means that parents who are seeking a balance in wanting to have a greater role in their child's care are perhaps not prepared to go into the more comprehensive, private centre care&mdash;comprehensive in the sense that the parents are more distant, although they do have consultative structures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In taking away the operational subsidy, we are forcing these parent and staff run centres <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6782"> to compete against private centres. That is quite clearly stated as part of this government's intention in their aims and objectives in pursuing this particular bill. My colleague Senator Faulkner mentioned before what the government's justification is, and it is to encourage the services to become more efficient. Therefore, this government puts absolutely no value on the parents and staff playing a great role in the running of these centres. They are saying it does not matter. Once again, it is the economic bottom line that comes to the fore. As if it were not enough to say to parents, `We don't think you have got an appropriate role here,' in the next step as part of this package the government said that it would find $8.3 million to put together a financial assistance package for these community based centres that were reliant on operational subsidy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that is a bit of an insult to all those parents and staff who have been managing these centres very effectively for quite a long period of time. Not only was money offered for them to get through the transition period, but it was offered in such a way that they could not utilise that money themselves to smooth the transition, if this bill goes through. They had to purchase financial advice from a tender process that the government is initiating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to turn to some of the guidelines that were issued as part of that advisers' brief for the provision of financial and/or management advice to community based long day care centres. Basically, this brief provides for a service up to the value of about $3,000 and instructs the community based child&hyphen;care centres receiving operational subsidy to address the following matters. Advisers will not get approval through this tender process unless they do, because it says in the brief, `specific areas to be addressed by all advisers'. It is a very telling list, because it says a lot about what this government wants to do to these child&hyphen;care centres that are parent and staff run and are structured to suit the children of those parents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First of all, there is child to staff ratio management. From experience, trying to find a day care place for a baby is a lot harder <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> than trying to find a day care place for a toddler, and that is because there is a greater ratio. So when I see that the child&hyphen;staff ratio management needs to be addressed specifically as part of this financial advice, I become very concerned. I know that you could achieve greater efficiencies if you reduce your number of places for babies. I know that you can probably make your books look a bit better and have a lot more kids in your child&hyphen;care centre if they are all a bit older and the ratios are a bit less. But what does that say about the availability of places for babies where there is a demand? What does that say about a community based child&hyphen;care centre that has established itself and tries to maintain a fair and reasonable ratio amongst children of all ages, and balances out and cross&hyphen;subsidises the fact that they have so many toddlers, so many older children and so many babies? It is a very fine financial line for these centres to walk. This financial advisers' brief is going to send someone in there to try to sort that out for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Staffing and salary is also listed. There is a very genuine and a very important campaign being conducted by the union at the moment in pursuit of fair and reasonable wages for carers. Fair and reasonable wages for carers, to me, is something that is so important in ensuring that the people who are looking after our children are qualified. It has got everything to do with me as a parent, and all the parents out there, being confident about the nature of the care their child will be receiving.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not good enough to list staffing and salary as a means of trying to find efficiencies. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Budgeting, fee setting and monitoring are listed. That is basically telling these people who have been managing these centres for years how to do their business. Debt management, utilisation, records management and waiting list management are listed. Here is a good one: No. 8 on the list is fundraising opportunities. I would like to spend a couple of minutes telling you about a local community based day care centre that does receive operational funding and what their fundraising opportunities are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are 28 children in this particular centre, which is Wattle Child Care Centre <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6783"> here in Canberra. They fundraise like mad to get the facilities they need. This year alone, they have managed to raise enough money to get a terrific airconditioning system put in their centre. They have been going for about four years now. They have got 28 families and most of those parents are involved in the management and running of that centre. It is a centre where everybody knows each other and everyone has a say, as parents, about what goes on there. They all contribute; they all do little things. They raised about $2,200 for this centre over the last 12 months, because they had nowhere to turn for any grants or support for this type of funding. Yet we see here, at No. 8 in the advisers' brief for the provision of financial and management advice to these centres, `fundraising opportunities'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Does this government think that these centres do not take every fundraising opportunity that arises? Does this government think that they do not currently need to? The operational subsidy does not mean that what we are looking at is a bunch of centres that are sitting on great government subsidies. Things are still tight, even with the subsidy. The advisers brief says that fundraising opportunities need to be explored, and it talks about income generation planning, children's books and fetes. It even suggests that maybe they could run a fete.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me tell the government something. Most of these community based child&hyphen;care centres already do all of this. For the government to list them in this way is so condescending and such an insult to every parent who has made a contribution, whether it be through their time or their money. It is just not fair, and it is a slap in the face for those parents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have a look at No. 9, special services. It talks about a nappy service, food provision, the use of levies or fees for special services, the use of contact staff for specialised activities such as dance. Thank you very much! Special services are what contribute to making a child&hyphen;care service a quality service. They are part of the choice that parents make when they send their child to a specific centre. To say that special services need to be sold out or traded off as a way to cut costs is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> compromising directly the quality of care that parents choose, and that is unacceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are other issues that this report mentions, but I will not go on. I think honourable senators get the general view that this document is condescending and insulting in the extreme. It implies that community centres that receive the operational subsidy are totally inefficient and that there is no thought given as to how they are going to raise money themselves or improve the quality of services. This goes back to the perception of these centres as subsidised institutions. That is a false perception, but it is a perception that this government, through its statements, has sought to perpetuate. I have to say that they are only being consistent with every other publicly funded community service around.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a line of thought in the words that come out of this government consistently, which is that anything that receives public subsidy or public funding is in some way tainted or not as efficient as the pure private sector. That is where you come back to ideology. That is where you can see that we are not talking about community based day&hyphen;care centres being efficient. That justification has been exposed as false. What we are dealing with is a government that does not like paying any government money towards a community based service. My final point is this: what will it take for this government to realise that it cannot continue to con the public and con families that its policies suit them? The family tax initiative that the government has talked up so consistently will be wiped out singularly for so many families with the changes to child care. To say that this government is a government that cares about families just displays the massive chasm between what this government says and what this government does.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said earlier, day after day we sit in this chamber, as the Labor opposition, and see the structures that Labor fought hard to put in place that help families and that service specific needs being demolished one by one. They are not being replaced by anything. They are just being torn down. As a result, Australia will lose by it.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6784">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From a woman's perspective and a parent's perspective, this government is saying all the wrong things. It is sending all the wrong messages. There are families out there now who are probably reconsidering their role in the work force. The fact is that those centres' fees will probably go up as a direct result of this decision. If they try to hang onto their current level of services they will put their fees up. If you have got more than one child, maybe all you are working for is $40 or $50 a week because you have your children in care. And I know plenty of women who do it. On their incomes they may be pulling $30, $40, $50, $60 a week after they pay their child&hyphen;care costs. Maybe, for so many of those women and men, this is the last straw. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There can be no doubt that the availability of quality child care at an affordable price is one of the cornerstones that allows parents to participate in the work force and to undertake a range of other activities in the community interest. It is of fundamental importance, I think we all agree, that Australian families have access to child care. But that access must be equitable and fair, not only for those families needing child care but for the community that bears the cost.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That being said, there appear to be some fundamental misunderstandings about the changes proposed in the Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill and the claimed effect of those changes, especially the removal of the operational subsidy to community based long day care centres from 1 July 1997, which is the aspect that I want to deal with in the few minutes available to me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let's get a bit of reality into this and look at a few facts established by evidence before the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee's inquiry into this bill. When I say a bit of reality and a few facts, I am referring to facts as opposed to rhetoric and anecdote. There is nothing fair and equitable about 30 per cent of parents, or 70,000 families, using community based centres, getting a subsidy of nearly $40 million each year while the rest, 70 per cent or 220,000 families, currently using private, employer or non&hyphen;profit child&hyphen; <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> care centres, are getting no benefit from this subsidy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look a little more closely at the statistics, the way the subsidy currently operates is starkly unfair. The private sector provides services to a greater proportion of low income families than the community sector, with 96,000 families in the private sector on maximum child&hyphen;care assistance, compared with only 27,000 families in the community sector. The private sector provides double the number of places for children of sole parents compared with the community sector. The private sector provides 31,000 places for children with special needs compared with 16,300 in the community sector. The private sector provides 20,500 places in rural and remote areas as opposed to 9,100 in the community sector. The private sector also cares for a disproportionately larger number of children under two and babies than does the community sector&mdash;14,000 in community centres as opposed to 26,000 in the private sector. Figures indicate that some 18,000 higher income families, not otherwise qualifying for child&hyphen;care assistance, are using subsidised community centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The argument that fees in community centres will rise beyond the reach of parents cannot be sustained. Firstly, the private centres manage to provide by far the magnitude of child&hyphen;care services and places for relatively the same weekly amount as paid by parents using the subsidised centres. The government has designated $8.3 million over the next two years to help centres seek professional assistance in planning for removal of their subsidies&mdash;a grant of up to $3,000 for each centre. If the private centres can do it, and do it for a much larger number of children than do the community centres, then the community centres, certainly with assistance, should be able to do it. The decision will, of course, be up to the management, with the parents and management of each of the centres seeing how they are going to adapt and what efficiencies they can make.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government recognises the need for access to diverse forms of care and in fact it has retained the operational subsidies for family day care schemes, occasional and out <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6785"> of school hours care. The subsidy also remains in place for multifunctional children's services and multifunctional Aboriginal children's services. Children with special needs are specifically assisted in the continuation of the supplementary services program and the introduction of a special needs subsidy scheme. The government will provide supplementary funding to ensure that families in such areas do not lose their access to existing child&hyphen;care services. In providing these funds the government will give priority to areas where private long day care centres are not available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has a unique quality improvement and accreditation system for its child&hyphen;care centres. The National Childcare Accreditation Council, through its mandatory peer review system for all centres, both private and community, ensures that good standards are reached and maintained in the child&hyphen;care industry. No longer is it only the community day care centres that meet the requirements for quality. The argument that community centres provide better quality care than the private centres now rings somewhat hollow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The existing system of child care in Australia has accomplished a great deal. I think we all need to acknowledge that. By the same token, we need to realise that we have to move on. We have to realise that there are divergent views on the best ways of providing services. What is beyond argument, however, is the need to set policy which meets an acknowledged need in a fair and equitable way. Putting community centres on an equal footing with private centres is a justifiable step. It is in the interests of efficiency, it is in the interests of equity and it is in the interests of at least simplifying the maze of options for child care that are currently available. I commend the bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

We can say that it is outright nonsense at this stage, and it was three days before the election&mdash;three days before this coalition government faced the public that they now need to face in the light of their obvious plans to do otherwise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the removal of the operational subsidy for community based long day care centres on which I wish to focus my attention today. A brief look at the report on this legislation, prepared by the Senate Community Affairs <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6786"> Legislation Committee, shows clearly the shameful lack of regard the coalition has for Australian workers and their families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Coonan has just said that you cannot say that private centres do not provide the same quality as community based centres. I actually agree with her, if you are looking at centres on a one&hyphen;to&hyphen;one basis. But a system which includes operational subsidies to community based child&hyphen;care centres, and a system that allows the skew to ensure that quality occurs in some sectors, ensures that that quality is maintained across the child&hyphen;care sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me go back to the report. According to the figures presented in appendix 3 of the report headed `Operational subsidy&mdash;some key statistics', 27.1 per cent of the total number of all child&hyphen;care places are in community based child-care centres and receive the benefit of the operational subsidy. The government argues that the removal of the operational subsidy will place community based long day care centres and private long day care centres on an equal footing. But this view ignores the differences between community and private sectors and simplistically follows the market view that considers parents and children as buyers and child care as a commodity to be purchased, and that has not been the view to date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Community based long day care centres are run on a not-for&hyphen;profit basis. Unlike privately operated centres, they are run by local government, community organisations or churches. They usually have a management committee made up of parents. Indeed, this is one of the most valued aspects of community based care, as parents welcome the opportunity to participate in decisions made regarding the care of their children. It is one of the reasons why parents choose community based care for their children. Community based long day care provides for proportionally more of the expensive services&mdash;that is, care of children under two and care of disabled children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Referring again to appendix 3 of the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee report, it can be seen that in the community based sector over 30 per cent of places are filled by nought to two&hyphen;year olds. In the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> private sector only 21 per cent of places are provided for babies under two years of age. Almost 36 per cent of community based places are filled by children with additional needs. This falls to as little as 25 per cent in the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The community based sector provides a higher proportion of its places in rural and remote areas than does the private sector, and this is one of the major areas that will be affected. The main body of the legislation committee's report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The private sector also provides double the number of places for children of sole parents compared with the community sector. DHFS noted that for children of sole parents who are working, the private sector provides 20 500 places (10 900 in the community sector);</PARA>
<PARA>Proportionally, this equates to 16.7 per cent of places in the private sector going to sole parent families, while in the community sector the proportion jumps to nearly 24 per cent. The report uses the raw figures to conclude that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is apparent from these figures that there is an artificial inequity in the quality and cost of services between private and community child care services. Accordingly, the Committee is therefore of the opinion that the current subsidy arrangements have an extremely limited, if any, discernible impact on the reasons for families choosing child care facilities.</PARA>
<PARA>The reality in the figures presented in the report, if not in the conclusions that government members drew from them, is that, proportionally, community based long day care centres cater for more babies, more children with additional needs, more children living in rural and remote areas and more children of sole parent working families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a testament to the valued place that community based long day care centres have in the Australian community today. They are giving nearly 30 per cent of working families a real choice about the care arrangements for their children. It is this sector that should be supported, not abandoned by the government with the removal of the operational subsidies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My own child is in a long day care private centre. I already pay an additional fee, because I choose only to use that centre on a part&hyphen;time basis. It probably meets some of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6787"> additional administrative costs associated with just using the centre one, two or three days a week rather than five. But I wonder whether, because of the age of my baby and because the competition which currently exists in relation to community based centres who receive operational subsidies, that competition's removal may now mean that I will be expected to pay more, because my baby is under two years of age. Will that perhaps occur in private long day care centres?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will not dispute that the quality between the centre that my son attends and the community based centre in the local area may well not be very different, but with a change to the overall system&mdash;a change which will remove the skew ensuring quality&mdash;may well change that, because it will change the competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In closing I would like to make a comment on the issue of quality care. We hear much of the term `world best practice'. It is often applied to productivity and work practices and much importance is placed upon achieving a leading edge in world best practice. Perhaps the most dire consequence of this legislation is that the leading sector for quality care&mdash;for world best practice in child&hyphen;care services&mdash;is to have taken from it the resources necessary to develop that very leadership in quality services for the care of young children. Those resources will be removed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue of quality has been glossed over by the coalition with reassurances of accreditation under the quality improvement and accreditation system&mdash;a system I might add that has received very little support from members opposite in the past, in fact active opposition in many cases. I will forgive Senator Coonan for her comments on this issue, because she was not a member of the opposition in the last term, but it is very difficult to forgive the minister, the minister representing the minister and others present when this coalition was in opposition and attacked the accreditation system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In raising the issue of quality care, as I said I am not slighting the private child&hyphen;care sector. I am aware that the vast majority of private centres provide quality care. Indeed, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> because of Labor initiatives 85 per cent of private child&hyphen;care centres are accredited. The issue I raise is really one of leadership in the ongoing development of care benchmarks and this will be jeopardised by the removal of the operational subsidy to community based long day care centres, because the leadership will be the marketplace. The leadership will not be quality; it will be the marketplace. This bill should be rejected. It breaks further election commitments. It removes a genuine choice from working parents and it jeopardises the ongoing development of improvements in quality child care.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on the same matter as senators before me. Through the changes to child care this government is challenging a fundamental right, and that is the basic right to participate fully in the life of this country. As Senator Jacinta Collins has indicated, the Labor government put considerable time and effort into the establishment and development of quality affordable child care around Australia. Seventy per cent of child&hyphen;care facilities in Australia are run by the private sector. It has been mentioned before.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor government recognised that there were some areas which for a variety of reasons were not attractive to the private sector and therefore were clearly without access to child care. To address this inequity, which denied thousands of Australian families access to quality child care for their children, the Labor party supported the development of community based child&hyphen;care centres. These centres grew up in areas of need, for example in rural, remote and disadvantaged areas. The centres grew out of the efforts of community groups, the very people who actually used these centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They were never intended to make a profit; in fact, they were directed to run on a break&hyphen;even basis. This is to ensure that any monies made were put back into the centre to maintain and further improve the quality of the service that they provide. In recognition of the financial difficulties faced by centres in rural, remote and disadvantaged areas&mdash;areas the private sector is not interested in because there is no profit to be made and again I am <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6788"> not slighting the service provided by the private sector because it is excellent&mdash;the Labor government gave each of the community based centres an operational grant subsidy. This subsidy is vital to each and every community based centre, but nowhere more so than in my home state of Tasmania where not the national rate of 30 per cent but a whopping 70 per cent of child&hyphen;care facilities are community based.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is this bill going to do? This bill will discontinue the operational subsidy to the community based long day care centres from 1 July 1997. Effectively, this government is wiping its hands of child care, and it is saying, `Let the market forces rule; let the market forces provide child care. Let the private sector run child care and, if a few areas go without child&hyphen;care facilities and services, so what.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For some reason, this government just cannot see that it has a fundamental responsibility to ensure access to quality child care in the same way that it has a responsibility to provide quality schools and quality health care to all Australians, no matter where they live&mdash;something which recent initiatives would indicate the government has virtually no commitment to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think this government has quickly forgotten the pledge it made to govern for all Australians. It has certainly broken its pledge to look after particular concerns of regional Australia. It was regional Australia, incidentally, where the government got sufficient votes to become the government. Nowhere is that more clearly demonstrated than in this government's treatment of Tasmania.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is not the profit to be made to attract private enterprise in sufficient numbers to provide the number of child&hyphen;care places we need and in the locations where we need them. Currently, there are 60 long day care centres in the state caring for 1,789 children. Forty&hyphen;one of these are community based long day care centres, all of which receive the operational grants subsidy to allow them to survive. They offer high quality and affordable care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The centres are sponsored mainly by parent groups, and some are sponsored by local councils, of course. The parents themselves are involved in planning, evaluation and the actual running of the centres. Nineteen services are listed as private but, of these, two are actually community based and do not receive funds. They are the Exeter and Grammar School centres. Two other centres are workplace based. They are St Johns and Hobart TAFE. These four centres account for 180 places. So 1,789 plus 180 equals 1,969 places compared to 508 private places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can the private sector pick up the places lost if community based centres close? Should they pick them up? The answer is no, they can't and they won't. And why should they go into areas where profit is not available to them? The following quote is from a letter sent to me from the Exeter Child Care Centre. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6789"> As I said before, this centre does not receive the operational grants subsidy so, to all intents and purposes, it operates as a private centre. The letter highlights the problems faced by centres not receiving financial assistance, a situation which will become the rule, not the exception, obviously. The letter reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our centre has struggled to survive. In order to make ends meet it is necessary to employ a majority of part&hyphen;time and casual staff to give maximum flexibility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We monitor and change our staff roster on a daily, even hourly, basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During periods of low attendance, due to illness or fluctuations in work rosters, staff cannot be guaranteed work and may not be given any work for periods of time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is very unsatisfactory for staff and children and makes it difficult to maintain continuity of care.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Multi&hyphen;skilled staff are a requirement of the centre. Staff are required to be extremely flexible to work practices and hours.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Staff job descriptions include tasks such as cleaning, meal preparation, gardening and minor maintenance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have relied heavily on donations from the community as far as equipment and toys are concerned. Voluntary work by parents and staff is also relied upon, particularly for maintenance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The centre is operated on a week to week basis, with continuous monitoring of our bank balance, fees outstanding and running costs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Staff are very restricted as far as purchasing new equipment and supplies. We rely heavily on recycled materials and borrowing resources from various venues. Staff collect materials in their own time and at their own expense.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The building we currently use is rented to us at a very minimal rental. However we have reached the stage where it no longer adequately meets our needs and is also in need of much maintenance and improvement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The centre has not the finances to consider the funds required.</PARA>
<PARA>The reason I read that out is that this letter demonstrates the difficulties facing centres in areas where there is no privately run centre and they do not receive an operating grant subsidy. This bill will take the subsidy from centres, and they simply cannot function without it. Centres need a minimum of 50 children to be viable. We have several centres with fewer than 30 children in Tasmania. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> They are: Huonville, Brighton, Clarendon Vale, Ravenswood and Georgetown.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Brighton Children's Services are sponsored by the Brighton Council. They have been told to casualise their staff or close by Christmas. Clarendon Vale has made the hard decision to close this week. All of these centres have already been through a complete restructuring to enable them to be as efficient as possible. They have already been through the restructure. All of these centres face closure immediately on loss of subsidy. Half of the existing community based centres will close over the next two years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does the government imagine are their options if operational subsidies are removed? Is this government suggesting that they drop their standard of care? Are some Australians&mdash;poor Australians&mdash;entitled only to cheap and badly run child care or, more likely, no child care? Is that what this government is suggesting? Is the government suggesting that centres absorb the loss of the operational grants subsidy by substantially increasing their fees, therefore cutting out families who cannot afford the increase&mdash;the battlers that this government has gone on about? The battlers will not thank the government for this one. Is the government deliberately ensuring that they just give up and close? Is that the idea?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A centre on the north&hyphen;west coast of Tasmania has this to say about the impact of the loss of operational subsidy. Honourable senators do not have to believe me, these are the letters that I have been getting from Tasmanian child&hyphen;care centres. They say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Circular Head Child Care Centre Inc. is a community based service situated in the far north&hyphen;west coast of Tasmania with fees currently at one hundred and fifty dollars a week.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our community is classified as rural, isolated and disadvantaged.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no private service for child care within the proximity of three hundred and thirty&hyphen;six kilometres. Our closest neighbouring centre, which is also community based is at Wynyard, one hundred and sixty kilometres away.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The loss of operational subsidy to our centre means an increase in fees to one hundred and eighty dollars a week. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6790"> </PARA>
<PARA>That is what the child&hyphen;care centre at Circular Head is saying, not me. They continue:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Parents of special needs children will not have respite due to staffing cut backs. There is no other service within two hundred kilometres available to them. Qualified staff will no longer be affordable.</PARA>
<PARA>They are saying this, not me. They then say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Women will be forced to return from the workplace to their homes, due to the high cost of child care.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what the centre is saying. What is the government saying in response to statements like this? They are saying, `Restructure.' That is the great panacea&mdash;restructure. Where is the government getting its advice from except, of course, the National Commission of Audit in relation to this? As far as I am concerned, members of this government must walk around with their eyes shut and their fingers in their ears because there is a not a community based centre in Tasmania that has not already gone through a comprehensive restructuring, and there are no reasonable changes left to make.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to another local child&hyphen;care centre, Ulverstone Child Care Centre. In a letter to me they say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have always been extremely budget conscious bearing in mind that our operational costs determine the fee that our parents will have to pay. In recent years in particular we have restructured our staffing&mdash;eighty per cent of our budget&mdash;in a flexible, workable manner.</PARA>
<PARA>These are actual, real child&hyphen;care centres and that is what they are saying. I have another quote, from Wynyard Child Care Centre:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As with all long day centres, we have always had to submit a break&hyphen;even budget to the Commonwealth. We were unable to carry over money in reserve. Now with a time frame of less than eight months, we are supposed to completely restructure our financial management practices to cope with huge cuts to funding.</PARA>
<PARA>That is an impossible ask. They go on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">If our centre closes there is no alternative for the ninety&hyphen;seven families who use our service. Private centres are not likely to open up in our small town.</PARA>
<PARA>Correct. That is right. Even if centres are able to remain open, many aspects of the operation of the centres will be adversely affected by loss of operational subsidy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Places for babies will go, for example. Of the 14 private child&hyphen;care centres in the south <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the state, only four centres offer care for babies under 12 months of age. That is obviously due to the very high cost of caring for babies in Tasmania. We have excellent child&hyphen;staff ratios for children under 12 months of age, one staff member to three babies&mdash;that is excellent. The community based sector fills this gap and provides quality child care for children from birth. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Places for children with health, behavioural and developmental problems will no longer be available. Staff morale will be affected. Staff continuity and stability will be clearly compromised. Consistency within programs will disappear and families will lose valuable support. Tasmania has the highest unemployment rate in the country, we have the lowest population growth, we have the lowest productivity growth and we have an ineffectual state government&mdash;not exactly the circumstances to inspire investor confidence, not just in relation to child care but in terms of all areas. Private centres cannot and will not be able to take over from community based centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the time remaining to me, I turn to Devonport Child Care Centres Inc. In their correspondence they say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reason this state has not attracted privately owned centres is found in our high unemployment, our high staff child ratio which is a state licensing requirement, our lack of economic growth, a poor or nil return for the existing private operators and low population growth in this state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our unemployment is ten point seven percent compared to eight point eight per cent nationally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Staff child ratios are twice as high as Victoria. This is required because of the large number of part&hyphen;time children in care. For example our centre is licensed for 42 children at one time . . . </PARA>
<PARA>They say also:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we have one hundred and fifty enrolled for the week.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes that will come about as a consequence of this legislation are quite substantial. They are beneficial to Australian universities and Australian students. The previous government thought it was appropriate to prohibit universities from offering qualified Australians the same opportunities the universities were able to offer overseas students. That is, the universities could sell a place to an international student, but they could not sell a place to an Australian student. We believed that prohibition was inappropriate and we sought to remove it. The universities will welcome that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government thought that, if universities over&hyphen;enrolled and the government got a HECS contribution from those students, it was appropriate to simply pocket that money&mdash;put the money in the back pocket and say, `Thanks very much.' We believe that is inappropriate. The HECS contribution from over&hyphen;enrolled students should be returned to the universities. That is another source of income for those universities which have the space in courses to take more students without adding costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also decided to require students in lower cost courses to pay less than students in higher cost courses. The previous government thought it was appropriate that a teacher, who has a low course cost with a lower income, should pay the same annual contribution as a doctor, who has a high course cost and would expect to have a much higher income. That was an inequity in the previous government's HECS system that we believed should be removed. It was grossly inequitable to ask a doctor to pay only the same amount as a teacher or a nurse. Finally, we have got rid of that inequity.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6792">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Equally, the previous government was continuing to run down basic research funding. Madam President, you would have heard answers in this place before indicating this government's commitment to boosting the forward estimates in research funding for universities by something like $130 million. That is $130 million that the previous government would never have given to universities. These changes address those inequities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Universities will have an increased flexibility therefore to channel their efforts into their chosen area of expertise. That means that our universities&mdash;excellent as they are&mdash;have now been put in a position where they can more easily compete on an international scale with world-class universities. We would expect them to compete and compete well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australian undergraduate students also have increased choice.

Will the government now join the large number of countries, including the USA and the European Union, which have imposed or are considering imposing visa restrictions on the SLORC and economic sanctions against Burma under the current illegal and brutal regime in that country?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Obviously, we are disturbed and disappointed at the apparent return of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi to house arrest. The facts appear to be a little unclear, but our information is that she has been at least temporarily confined to her compound and five NLD youth members have been taken into custody after leaving her compound.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not have anything to suggest that there is any link with the admission of Burma to observer status of ASEAN, as was suggested by Senator Bourne, as I interpreted the question. I think she was suggesting that perhaps this was seen as some form of green light by <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the SLORC to go ahead with such further oppressive measures. There is nothing in my brief that would suggest that we have evidence to that effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been suggested that these unfortunate developments may be related to the heightened student tensions. I understand NLD plans to hold a public national day ceremony on 5 December, and SLORC efforts to stop Suu Kyi from meeting foreign journalists visiting Rangoon might also be part of the motivation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously, we would wish to see her released immediately. Obviously, we would wish to see an improved human rights environment in Burma. The latest signals&mdash;they have been up and down during this year&mdash;can only be expressed as very disappointing. The dilemma for the international community remains what actions we can take beyond our wishes to see a better environment and respect for human rights within Burma.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Bourne would be aware of the actions that we have taken, some of which we inherited from the previous government and have continued&mdash;the suspension of our aid program, the ban on defence exports, our position of not encouraging trade and investment. She may be aware that we lobbied hard to achieve the tough UNGA resolution on Burma adopted on 27 November calling on the SLORC to urgently implement human rights reforms. It was an effort to get the international community again to work together on this difficult subject.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can also tell Senator Bourne that, during the last six months, we have intensified our regional diplomacy on Burma. Australia's leading role in raising the profile of Burma at the ASEAN regional forum in July is just one example.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Behind the scenes we have been involved in intensive diplomacy with our ASEAN colleagues, who tend to have greater influence on Burma's behaviour than we do. We will continue such measures.</PARA>

Given that this resolution follows the recommendations of the International Court of Justice and of the comprehensive test ban treaty which call on parties to pursue negotiations in good faith leading towards disarmament and allows for the steps outlined by the Canberra commission and given Australia's stance on the nuclear non&hyphen;proliferation treaty, the CTBT, the International Court of Justice decision and the Canberra commission, how could the government justify not supporting or abstaining from a vote on this highly important resolution?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will give a little background to this because I am not sure that all <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> senators would be familiar with this matter. The Malaysian sponsored General Assembly resolution urging negotiations on nuclear disarmament was a new resolution which built upon extracts from the advisory opinion on the legality of the threat or use of nuclear weapons issued by the International Court of Justice in July.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As you know, Madam President, the Australian government is fully committed to achieving nuclear disarmament. While we were therefore sympathetic to the general nuclear disarmament aims behind the resolution, we were concerned about its main thrust, which was early negotiation on a nuclear disarmament convention. It was the view of the Australian government that there are many steps to be taken on the road to the ultimate goal of nuclear disarmament before the question of a single nuclear weapons convention could be productively addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia would therefore have preferred this resolution to focus attention on the immediate and intermediate concrete steps which would take forward the process of nuclear disarmament rather than seeking an artificial timetable or possible final mechanism for achieving the goal. Australia therefore abstained on the resolution, as did other regional countries such as Japan and South Korea.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's abstention sought to balance considerations such as Australia's commitment to the twin goals of preventing proliferation of nuclear weapons and working through progressive balanced steps towards complete nuclear disarmament on the one hand and, on the other hand, our concern to ensure that international deliberation on the International Court of Justice's advisory opinion facilitates rather than complicates the attainment of real advances on the international disarmament agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While abstaining in the vote on the resolution as a whole, Australia did vote in favour of the operative paragraph of the resolution which underlined the unanimous opinion of the court that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There exists an obligation to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6798"> nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control.</PARA>
<PARA>Which, again, underlines the government's firm commitment to nuclear disarmament. In relation to the vote in the plenary session, there is no reason to believe&mdash;presuming it will be the same resolution that is returned&mdash;that Australia would change its position.</PARA></ANSWER>

The minister missed out the point that I raised in my question, which was that this resolution allows for the stepped approach outlined by the Canberra commission. Does the government concede that the resolution enjoys overwhelming global support and is likely to be passed with a comfortable majority at the December plenary session of the United Nations General Assembly, where further abstention by Australia would make us look even more hypocritical and less genuine in our previous attempts to further the cause of nuclear disarmament?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Coonan for the question. I am aware of the newspaper reports referred to by Senator Coonan. I have been in touch with the Queensland Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and I have received a detailed report from ATSIC. I find the actions of the police appalling. I find it beyond comprehension that anyone could decide that a gathering for a funeral was an appropriate opportunity to conduct a police raid, particularly when one considers the cultural insensitivity displayed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the information of the Senate, I have been advised that on 3 December a police contingent went to Woorabinda to serve 388 warrants on some 130 people. The warrants had been overdue for periods of between two days and two years. The amounts ranged from $20 to $700&hyphen;plus. As a result of the police raid, which occurred at the funeral of a highly respected elder, it is understood that at least 27 people were taken into police custody. The police operation involved 21 police officers <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6799"> from Rockhampton and seven community police from Woorabinda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In light of the fact that many of the warrants are up to two years old, there may be a breach by the Queensland police of recommendation 120 of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. The Queensland government gave qualified support to the recommendation, which is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That governments consider introducing an ongoing amnesty on the execution of long&hyphen;outstanding warrants of commitment for unpaid fines.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The source of that is the response by the governments to the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, volume one. The Queensland Department of Aboriginal Affairs and ATSIC, in conjunction with the police minister's office, are investigating the incident. I understand that the Queensland police minister, Mr Russell Cooper, will be making a statement regarding the incident to the state parliament later today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS> newspaper today police minister Russell Cooper was reported as saying that he was `appalled at the decision to continue the operation while the funeral of a highly respected elder was taking place'. I agree with and welcome that comment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government believes that the state and territory governments must make a top priority of implementing fully the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. Issues like this will be considered at the forthcoming ministerial summit on high Aboriginal incarceration rates and deaths in custody. I can only repeat that I find the matter appalling and I look forward with interest to the statement by Mr Cooper later today in the Queensland parliament.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to get this question, particularly from Senator Abetz, because he is one of the senators who have been pressing the very justified claims of Tasmania to a fair and reasonable share of the Natural Heritage Trust. I am pleased to get the question today because this is the historic day on which the Senate has voted in principle for the sale of one&hyphen;third of Telstra to fund this Natural Heritage Trust in order for us to put in place the largest capital fund for reinvestment in Australia's natural capital in the history of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Abetz, your state and your coastline, which you accurately remind us exceeds that of Victoria and New South Wales combined, will benefit from that fund. So it is a great day and I am pleased to give recognition to your contribution. I remind Senator Abetz that $100 million will be now devoted to our coasts and clean seas policy under the Natural Heritage Trust. That will benefit all Australia, all Australians. CoastCare itself, which you refer to in reference to CoastCare Week, brings the community into this process, because it is a week in which we acknowledge the thousands of ordinary Australians who are devoting their time and energy to caring for local coastlines through CoastCare groups. This is in fact the new environmental movement in Australia&mdash;something the Labor Party does not seem to appreciate&mdash;with tens of thousands of Australians out there making a contribution, recognising problems in their environment and doing something about them.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am advised that there are now some 700 such community groups nationwide. We estimate that about 140,000 Australians are involved in those groups. Between them they now have some 250 projects under way to rehabilitate beaches and dunes, control weeds, survey and protect flora and fauna, prepare management plans, undertake monitoring, and educate the community on coastal and marine matters. The government supports the CoastCare groups. It supports them through direct financial assistance for their work and also through supporting CoastCare facilitators who are employed to assist local CoastCare groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was therefore pleased last weekend, on Ocean Care Day, to announce $722,000 worth of CoastCare projects for Victoria. I did so in conjunction with my Victorian colleague Marie Tehan. This is the first of this year's CoastCare funding which will be going to communities all around Australia. The Victorian allocation is of course part of the $3 million that we have provided to the program this year, which I remind you is a doubling of last year's program which was put in place by Labor.</PARA>

One of the saddest things to come out of any war is those people who have suffered some form of post traumatic stress disorder.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For a proportion of Vietnam veterans who are continuing to suffer that disorder, it is a very distressing matter and often leads to family break-ups and occasionally, as you have said, to crime. I am not certain whether the Vietnam veterans entitlements under legal aid that you are referring to are affected by the changes which Mr Williams has announced. Certainly, the Commonwealth is requiring the states to provide legal aid in respect of state laws. Nevertheless, as I understand it, where people are in receipt of Commonwealth income by way of financial support, like social security benefits, the Commonwealth can help.

The question relates to using horror stories from the United States to suggest that Australian motorists are at risk from airbags. I am advised that in Australia there are no grounds for concern.

Airbags are used as the primary restraint mechanism for protecting motorists in collisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This means that airbags in US vehicles are triggered more aggressively and earlier to capture an unharnessed occupant.

I always <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> attempted to give sensible and accurate answers&mdash;at a cost, because I had to work a lot harder to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today, the first question Senator Newman was asked was a very serious question about the one per cent Medicare levy, why the legislation had not proceeded, and why Mrs Bishop was running interference, preventing that legislation from emerging&mdash;something which Senator Newman, as a cabinet minister, should have been across. She did not answer the question at all; just took it on notice and sat down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She was asked a second question on data matching. You only have to read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record to know how often she and her colleagues have spoken on data matching. Yet we got a contemptuous answer here today with total disdain and disrespect for the Senate. She just wiped it off, not answering the question. Those opposite were very vocal in opposition about data matching. Now the amnesia has hit; now they can say absolutely nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then Senator Newman got a third question on her own department. She could not answer it. Finally, because she could not answer the other three, we managed to get question No. 7 or 8 up on veterans' affairs, which she could not answer either. This is serious. It is not good enough to come into this chamber with a plaintive plea, like at the end of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Elephant Man</EMPHASIS> film. `I am only representing a minister,' she says, as though she has no responsibility whatsoever for providing information to this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a higher responsibility in the Senate because, normally, there are only seven or eight ministers collectively representing about 21 or 22 ministers in the other place. They treat it with contempt over there&mdash;it is an institutionalised thing&mdash;but not over here, and it is not reflected necessarily by other ministers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Hill, who is sitting there, always tries at estimates committees and in this chamber to answer questions. I will not flatter him on the competence of his answers&mdash;I would not want to embarrass him&mdash;but at least he tries. But Senator Newman at estimates committees does not try at all. The <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6808"> secretary, Tony Blunn, is the spokesman; he answers everything. Senator Newman sits there silent. The silent senator sits there, saying nothing because she cannot get into trouble if she does not say anything.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She does not even bother to bring her Defence portfolio brief. Where is it? Can she wave it around? Did she bring it down today? No, she did not. Did she bring it down in the last few weeks? No, she did not. That is her contempt for this chamber: she does not even bring the defence department brief with her, does she? No, she does not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today we had a total failure to address these issues. It is the old saying: ignorance is bliss. Senator Newman would be a very happy person today. Not only does she say, `I am only representing,' but she also always puts in her answer `the opposition is not interested in this answer' when it is a non&hyphen;answer. Then there is a repeat of the question, which takes up 30 seconds. `Thank you for the question,' takes up another 10 seconds. With a couple of compliments to the person in the chair we are a minute into the answer. Then suddenly she says, `I will seek further information.' She says it in a very gracious and kindly way&mdash;that is terrific&mdash;but we want to see the answers now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also want to see whether Senator Newman can hack it in this chamber. Clearly, she cannot. She cannot handle the cut and thrust. She had to come in here today and read prepared articles out of the newspapers&mdash;golly gosh, wasn't that really funny&mdash;but she cannot defend herself, her own record, or her failure to answer questions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, there was the answer that Senator Newman gave Senator Lundy where she described the quote as `salacious'. What did you mean by that, Minister?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me tell you that you are going to fail. You people know from your own reports that two demographic areas that were particularly adverse for the ALP in the 1996 failed election campaign were women and the aged&mdash;in this case, the women.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another matter that really gets at the Labor Party is that Senator Newman, in her capacity as minister, has targeted those areas in welfare where people are getting funds which they should not be getting. She has been criticised by the Labor Party for that. But their own research from the last federal election tells us under the heading `Targeted welfare' that it seemed that everyone knew of a welfare cheat. This exploitation was blamed on Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Newman, in a very methodical and professional manner, is going about knocking out those sorts of rorts&mdash;and you people criticise her for it. Each time you criticise her, the more support we get in the electorate. So I welcome these debates when Senator Faulkner and Senator Robert Ray get up&mdash;and undoubtedly somebody else will get up&mdash;to try to criticise Senator Newman for the excellent job she does.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise also to take note of the answers&mdash;or those things that are referred to as answers&mdash;given by Senator Newman. I have to say that Senator Newman is right: we are not entitled to criticise her for her physical appearance or the method that she uses to speak. But there are certain things that we are entitled to criticise her for as a minister.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> One of the duties of ministers is to answer properly questions given to them in this chamber at question time. Certainly, if someone cannot answer those questions, they are entitled to be criticised. That is why we have raised this matter here today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation has occurred on many occasions that Senator Newman has quite rudely pointed out to me that she is not the minister for health; that she only represents the minister for health in this chamber. But the fact is that, even though she only represents the minister for health, she certainly has a responsibility, at least to a certain level, to get the briefings on the issue and provide at least some sort of rudimentary answer in the area of health. On many occasions&mdash;and even today&mdash;Senator Newman has failed to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today she took it one step further because not only did she fail to answer questions on the portfolio that she represents from the other house; she also failed to deal in an adequate way with issues raised within her own portfolio. That really is quite sad.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was quite amusing to hear some of the matters Senator Newman raised about the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Faulkner). It was almost, `This is your life, Senator Faulkner.' That was pretty amusing. We actually enjoyed it in some respects, but the fact is that Senator Faulkner does not have responsibilities as a minister that he is not carrying out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this shows about Senator Newman is that she is failing to carry out her responsibilities as a minister; she is failing to get across the issues she should be getting across. She has the capacity to do the research and the preparation, as demonstrated in the speech she read on Senator Faulkner, but she just has not bothered. She has the capacity. She has the ability. She has the time to prepare for those <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6810"> issues but, when making the choice on how to spend her time, she decided that she would prefer to prepare a speech in criticism of Senator Faulkner than actually prepare to answer questions on the issues in her portfolio. That is extraordinarily disappointing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I notice that the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Hill) has not bothered to defend her. He has run off and is only sticking his head through the door. He could not be bothered getting on to his hind legs, so he sent Senator Panizza, the whip, running over to see Eric&mdash;third, fourth or fifth bat; I am not sure&mdash;to get up and defend Senator Newman, rather than taking on that responsibility himself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some issues that are very important that Senator Newman should have been concentrating on. One such issue is the disaster that has come about because of how this government has dealt with the issue of private health insurance. The fact is that private health insurance in this country has gone from bad to worse during the stewardship of this government. We have a situation where, even after the government has expended the sum of $600 million of public moneys, people are still paying the same level of premiums as they were before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, the Minister for Health and Family Services, Michael Wooldridge, admitted shortly after the budget that he was aware at the time of the budget that HBA&mdash;or National Mutual, as they also are known&mdash;had already put in an application for premium increases that would undermine and make valueless the moneys that were being spent to subsidise private health insurance.

Not only that; the answers were incomprehensible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for Senator Ray coming in here and mocking someone for using a malapropism, I find that just unbelievable. Constantly, people in this chamber use words incorrectly&mdash;like `fulsome' and all sorts of other words&mdash;especially in the heat of debate. A word can come out that is not quite the right one. We all do it. Senator Ray obviously would have done it at some time, but he came in here, in a most degrading way, and used that as some sort of indication that Senator Newman was not capable of doing her job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Faulkner said that Senator Newman did not have the right to take her pay. Senator Newman is not in the chamber at this very moment. Do you know what she is doing? She is launching a booklet to circulate around women's groups, which is one of her portfolios. In that booklet are details of all members of parliament from both sides of this house and from both sides of the House of Representatives. That booklet is designed so that people in the community&mdash;in particular women and women's groups&mdash;can have access to parliament. That was never done by a minister of the Labor government&mdash;never.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Newman is doing her job in bringing parliament to the people and making it accessible to the members of the public&mdash;in particular, making women of this parliament accessible. She is launching that booklet. She has had it prepared, and we have all made contributions. In a non&hyphen;partisan way, she has ensured that there are Democrats, Independents, Labor, Liberal and National Party women represented in that booklet, as well as representatives from all the committees to which she could go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say something else, as the chairman of the government social security committee. I have been with Senator Newman when she has been out visiting regional offices. I have met people who have said, `I've worked in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6811"> Social Security for 19 years and I have never seen a minister.' I have seen Senator Newman walk up to a counter of a regional office and have someone at the counter say, `Senator, it is outrageous. We have had people coming in here making a claim on this benefit to which they are not really entitled, saying that they have a disabled child. Yet there are people who come in here who really do have children with disabilities who are missing out.' Senator Newman is hearing what people are saying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She has e-mail directed to her own office so that officers in regional offices&mdash;people at the coalface delivering the services&mdash;can e-mail her with concerns. There was a very simple one the other day when I was out with her. A person expressed a problem associated with people in nursing homes. The problem was that, when people go into respite care, they have to get the information to Social Security that they are now not a couple but are singles for the two weeks. If they do not get it in on time, they lose their benefit. I raised that with Senator Newman because it was raised with me as we were both going around, and I know that will be addressed. That is the sort of thing she is doing&mdash;going and listening to the people who are delivering the services. And her officers are responding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sick leave is dropping. When the opposition were in government, sick leave in Social Security increased from 10.3 days a year. The previous government got a two per cent productivity increase, and they said they were going to decrease sick leave to 8.3 days a year as part of their saving of $6 million. Out of their $12 million productivity increase, $6 million of it was going to come from reducing sick leave. But what happened after two years? Sick leave went up to 12.3 days a year and cost $6 million more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since Senator Newman has been the minister, sick leave has been going down. The Social Security officers are responding to her and responding to her leadership. We are also seeing savings being made with the reduction in fraudulent claims&mdash;another response to Senator Newman's innovations in the Department of Social Security. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Together with this first National Report, I am tabling a policy paper on local government, Commonwealth, Councils &amp; Community&mdash;Looking <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6812"> Ahead, which challenges local government to take advantage of Commonwealth support and work together to advance good governance, good economic management and greater fairness in our community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We would all agree that local government plays a key role in the well&hyphen;being of every Australian.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From Huon Valley to Minjilang, from Busselton to Cardwell, across Australia some 770 local councils provide leadership and services to their local communities. In total, local government expenditure exceeds $11 billion or some 5% of total government spending, and in 1995&hyphen;96 local councils employed some 155,000 people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The services of local government are vital to businesses as well as to individuals. Local public works, recreation, public health, community services, building, planning and development approval, and cultural activities are just a few examples of services for which we rely on local councils.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite the diversity in councils, the central challenge for each is to provide the highest quality and widest range of services consistent with the needs and aspirations of its community and the resources available. This must be achieved within the provisions of relevant State and Territory legislation and regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If Australia is to develop and prosper, all three spheres of government&mdash;Commonwealth, State and Territory and local, must play their part in establishing a framework of governance which allows individuals, families, business and communities to realise their potential and flourish.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To meet this challenge, councils must:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">seek continuous improvement in all council activities;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">identify and introduce new technologies or processes which can achieve quantum improvement in councils' operations or service delivery;</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">seek to broaden and deepen the council financial base to provide greater financial capacity and stability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many councils are taking up this challenge and this needs to be an ongoing process, as it is for other governments and the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While local government governance is primarily an issue for State and Territory governments and local councils themselves, the Commonwealth wishes to ensure that financial assistance to local government contributes to optimal community outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most local councils derive the largest share of their revenue from property rates. Other sources of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> income generated by councils include charges for garbage collection, public services, housing and community services, economic services, health and community services, recreational and cultural amenities and charges associated with development activities. Total income from these sources, however, is generally not sufficient to fully finance councils' operations and provide an appropriate level of services to residents. Councils with small populations and a limited revenue base are often among the most stretched.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth provides significant financial assistance and program funding to local government. As a matter of good management, however, local councils should seek as far as possible to achieve financial security in their own right. This requires them to consolidate their revenue bases, explore alternative financing mechanisms and ensure that their administration and services are as affordable and efficient as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1996&hyphen;97 the Commonwealth is contributing over $1.2 billion to increase the financial capacity of local councils and provide greater certainty in their funding. This represents an increase of four per cent over Commonwealth funding to local government in 1995&hyphen;96, an excellent result for local government in the light of the very difficult economic circumstances faced by the Government when it came to office.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The funding provided by the Commonwealth through financial assistance grants (FAGs) is a significant element in the budgets of individual local councils, ranging up to around half of their income in some cases, especially in remote areas. The overall contribution by FAGs to local government income is over ten per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In keeping with the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act the Government will initiate a review of local government financial assistance, to be carried out not later than 30 June 2001. This will be done in consultation with the States and Territories and local government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An important purpose of the report being tabled today is to improve the transparency with which States and the Northern Territory Grants Commissions determine the distribution of financial assistance to councils within their jurisdictions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Working Nation</EMPHASIS> white paper on employment and growth in 1993 brought together the Commonwealth and local authorities for, perhaps, the greatest ever expansion of intergovernmental relations in the history of Australian public administration. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Working Nation</EMPHASIS>, as I am sure you would appreciate, put in place the government infrastructure that was needed for regional economic decision making to be moved out of Canberra to the regions themselves where teams of local leaders, with the support, of course, of the Commonwealth, best identified strengths and weaknesses and also best identified how these should be addressed. It was <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Working Nation</EMPHASIS> that put into place organisations which reported directly to the federal government on local matters.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, Senator Carr. I might say that the regional development organisations, better known to all senators as RDOs, and the area consultative committees actually comprise local government representatives, employer groups, unions, local business leaders and education and training providers in many regions around the country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> RDOs and ACCs were responsible for the local allocation of Commonwealth money and for advising Canberra of local needs and of priorities. It is important that we acknowledge that this has meant that there was an unprecedented devolution of power from the Commonwealth to regional bodies, and it was largely based around existing alliances between local government authorities. I sincerely believe that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Working Nation</EMPHASIS> was a major turning point for intergovernmental relations in Australia, really with local government <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6814"> becoming a major player in the national economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What it also did, of course, was allow Canberra to draw back from the role of driving priorities.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We did have a situation where Canberra could draw back from the role of driving priorities and it allowed, as I have indicated, local leadership to do this within the policy framework. So part of the Working Nation commitment, as Senator Campbell knows only too well, was an array of labour market programs. They were aimed at assisting long&hyphen;term unemployed to gain relevant training and recent work experience. These programs, I believe, were extraordinarily successful, such as the landcare and environment action program.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point I want to make is that these local government authorities were absolutely instrumental as sponsors of LEAP and new work opportunities projects around the country.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 1: That the Bill proceed, however, the Committee foreshadows amendments in the Committee of the Whole.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government agrees that the Bill should proceed, and notes that the Committee foreshadows amendments in the Committee of the Whole.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 2: That the words `Board' and `Trust' be changed or greater explanation be given in the Bill of the parliamentary accountability arrangements and the roles of the various Ministers.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government notes the Committee's concern that the use of the name `Board' to describe the partnership of administration between the Ministers for the Environment and Primary Industries and Energy may convey the impression of a body less subject to parliamentary scrutiny. The details provided below clearly show that this is not the case, as the decisions of the Board and the financial transactions of the Trust will be subject to normal Parliamentary scrutiny and accountability arrangements. However, to avoid confusion about the role of the Board and to make it clear that this is a Ministerial body, the Government will propose an amendment to the Bill to change the name to `Natural Heritage Ministerial Board'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill already includes clauses which ensure parliamentary accountability and provide opportunities for parliamentary scrutiny in the same way and to the same degree as other Government agencies:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 33 provides that the Minister for the Environment must cause to be prepared an annual report which includes, but is not limited to, a report about the operations of the Trust during the relevant financial year, financial statements relating to those operations and the Auditor-General's report on the financial statement (cl. 33(1)).</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report on the operations of the Trust during the relevant financial year and the financial statements must comply with written guidelines issued by the Minister for Finance (cls 33(2) and 33(3)).</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 34 provides that the financial statements must be given to the Auditor-General for examination and report. The Auditor-General is required to state whether the financial statements had been prepared in accordance with the Finance Minister's guidelines and whether they give a true and fair view of the matters required by those guidelines (cl. 34(3)). Consistent with the requirement that Departmental Annual <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Reports are prepared prior to Senate Estimates Committee hearings, the Annual Report on the operation of the Trust will also be prepared in a timely manner.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The annual report must be laid before each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after the completion of the preparation of the report (cl.33(4)).</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy must give the Minister for the Environment such information as will allow the latter to comply with the reporting provisions of the Reserve (cl.33.(5)).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Parliamentary scrutiny of the Trust will also be possible in a number of other ways. The consolidated revenue funds which will flow into the Trust, for example, will be able to be scrutinised in the normal way by Parliament. Details will be reported in the Budget context via the Portfolio Budget Statements which are Budget Related Papers tabled in both Houses. Trust expenditure will also be subject to normal Senate Estimates scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To facilitate this scrutiny Environment Australia and the Department of Primary Industries and Energy have offered to appear together at Senate Estimates hearings, so that the Senators can address any questions under the heading of the Natural Heritage Trust with relevant officers from both Departments present.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of the above provisions already in the Bill and the opportunities for Parliamentary scrutiny, the Government does not believe it is necessary to include further detail on parliamentary accountability arrangements in the Bill itself, or change the name of the Trust. The Government will, however, provide further details in the explanatory memorandum to explain these arrangements and address the Committee's concerns.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is committed to ensuring a strong emphasis on community participation in priority setting and program implementation for the Trust initiatives, and will ensure that the Trust's advisory structures reflect this commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Ministerial Board will receive expert advice across the range of Trust initiatives from the full gamut of interested groups already represented on existing advisory bodies (including the statutory National Landcare Advisory Committee (NLAC) which reports to both Ministers on natural resource management issues, the Biological Diversity Advisory Committee (BDAC), the Murray-Darling Basin Community Advisory Council (MDBCAC), the Endangered Species Advisory Committee (ESAC)), and also from the new Council for Sustainable Vegetation Management (CSVM). Community project assessment procedures will be transparent and apply through regional and State panels.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is also committed to the principle of encouraging devolution of funding and decision making to the lowest practicable level, consistent with maintaining sound environmental, natural resource management and sustainable agriculture outcomes subject to proper accountability and national priorities being addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government believes that the establishment of an additional Advisory Panel, as proposed by the Committee, would be inconsistent with this principle and would duplicate the existing and proposed new advisory mechanisms outlined above, some of which have existing statutory responsibilities. The establishment of the Panel would also conflict with the Government's commitment to streamline project funding processes, by adding another level of project assessment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">3.4 that as far as possible, and if appropriate, the existing specific purpose advisory councils should be retained and be a source of advice to the Panel if necessary</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government agrees that advisory arrangements for the Natural Heritage Trust should be as streamlined as possible and should avoid duplication.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the statement `Investing in Our Natural Heritage', Senator the Hon Robert Hill said "We will develop integrated approaches to minimise the number of separate programs and consequent paper warfare." The Government agrees that administrative processes should be streamlined and is currently undertaking a consultation process with States/Territories, community and non-government organisation representatives on proposed management arrangements for Trust programs. The aim is to ensure that delivery of programs is organised so as to ensure that natural resource management, sustainable agriculture and nature conservation programs are complementary; that the interface between these programs and the community is straightforward; and that public funding is directed to catalytic, strategic investments in natural capital with clearly identified and measurable outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The aim is to have the streamlined arrangements in place so that projects can be funded in the 1997-98 financial year, recognising that a lead time of some six months is needed for such grants programs between the time applications are sought and announcements of funding are made by Ministers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the principles which will underpin the delivery of the Natural Heritage Trust package is that, as far as practicable, interaction between local communities and government bureaucracies in relation to Trust programs should be simple, readily understood and based on the "one-stop-shop" concept.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">3.7 The Bill should include a reference to the type of advisory structures which will be put in place by the Departments and their roles and responsibilities and that separate regulations should contain the role of the Advisory Panel, the tenure of members etc.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government does not believe it is necessary to include details of advisory structures in the Bill, as most of the advisory bodies are already established by other legislation (eg. NLAC, MDBCAC, &amp; ESAC), while others (eg. CSVM) are intended to be non-statutory, expert bodies.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given that the Environment Minister is responsible for the Bill and subsequent administration of the Act, and that the Trust is domiciled in Environment Australia (which is responsible for reporting on Trust operations), the Government does not believe it is necessary to explicitly state the Environment Minister's primacy by making the Minister Chair of the Ministerial Board.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government does not consider it is appropriate to specify the relative roles and responsibilities of each Department in legislation. This is an administrative matter which will be handled in the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the two Departments. The MOU will establish the framework within which Environment Australia and DPIE will work cooperatively towards common and complementary environmental natural resource management and sustainable agriculture outcomes. It will clarify respective roles and responsibilities and ensure a coordinated approach to management of Trust initiatives through agreed operational principles and interdepartmental coordinating structures. The MOU will be available from Departments once it is signed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 5: That the Bill include broad goals and objectives in the environmental areas&mdash;Vegetation, Rivers, Biodiversity, Landcare, Coasts and Clean Seas, and Atmospheric Issues, to enable the Bill to respond to changes in priorities and that the Government give consideration to full description of the five capital projects in a portfolio statement. Such a statement could be made annually to inform the community on achievements and any changes in priorities.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill already includes the primary objectives of the five capital programs to be funded from the Trust (clauses 10&mdash;14).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government believes that to expand this to include broad goals and objectives in the key environmental and natural resource management areas listed above may actually restrict the ability of the Trust to respond to changes in priorities, as any activities to be funded in the future would have to meet the goals and objectives identified now to be legally eligible for funding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill essentially establishes a repository for funds. The details of the activities to be funded are set out in the Government's policy statements relating to the Trust. These will form the basis of program guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government believes the Bill already provides the flexibility for the Trust to adapt to changes in environmental priorities. In particular, clause 15 defines the type of activities that can be funded under the environmental protection purpose of the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Bill (clause 8(f)). The definition is broad enough to ensure that the wide range of activities necessary to achieve the objective of protecting and rehabilitating Australia's natural environment can be undertaken with funds from the Trust.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The five capital projects have already been described in the Statement by the Minister for the Environment on 20 August 1996, `Investing in our Natural Heritage'. The Committee's recommendation that a statement could be made annually to inform the community on achievements and any changes in priorities will be addressed in the context of the Trust's Annual Report as required under clause 33 of the Bill. In addition, the Government will prepare an annual whole-of-Government Budget Paper to identify the total Commonwealth expenditure on the environment across all Portfolios and agencies. This will be produced for the first time in the 1997-98 budget, and will include information on Natural Heritage Trust programs.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government does not believe that specific reference to these issues in the Bill is necessary as the environmental protection clause is broad enough to enable Trust funding to be provided in these areas. However, the Government will provide further information in the Explanatory Memorandum to explain the full range of programs intended to be funded through the Trust.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should also be noted that the Trust is not the sole source of funds for the Government's environment, natural resource management and sustainable agriculture programs, and many activities will continue to be funded through normal budgetary processes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 7: That the Government address funding for Australia's Built Heritage as a matter of priority.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The prime purpose of the Trust is to ensure a strategic and integrated delivery of the Commonwealth biodiversity conservation and sustainable agriculture programs. However, the Government also recognises that the built heritage is an important component of Australia's heritage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has therefore made a commitment to develop a national policy on heritage places. This initiative is identified in the Australian Heritage Commission's Discussion Paper "A National Future for Australia's Heritage", as a matter for further consultation and development with the community, conservation groups, industry, and State and Territory Governments. Funding for Australia's built heritage will be addressed in the development of this policy. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6818"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is also committed to refocussing the National Estate Grants Program to concentrate on projects of national importance. The revised program will assist projects that help identify, conserve and promote nationally important heritage places; seminal studies that develop methodologies or policies for heritage issues of national relevance; model studies, plans or projects which can serve as examples of best practice; and projects that encourage and facilitate community involvement in heritage activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is anticipated that these funds will be directed primarily towards historic and indigenous heritage projects, given other funding initiatives proposed under the Natural Heritage Trust.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 8: That the Government should consider whether gifts and bequest funds should be attracted by the fund and if so whether a more appropriate vehicle for handling such funds (perhaps a separate highly visible account and administration Board) should be established; and that if gifts and bequests are retained, the Bill should include reference to those of a certain amount being tax deductible; and that a watch be kept on the matter of gifts and bequests to ensure that funds are not attracted away from community-based groups.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For gifts (other than testamentary gifts/bequests) to the Natural Heritage Trust to be made tax deductible, it would appear necessary to amend section 78 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (ITAA) to specifically list the Trust as an eligible gift recipient. Deductibility for testamentary gifts/bequests raises separate issues, given that such gifts made to organisations listed in section 78 are not currently deductible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government will give careful consideration to the question of tax deductibility, bearing in mind a number of factors, such as the importance of the Trust in the Government's environment policy, the Government's general policy of not amending section 78, and the potential cost to revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government will monitor the impacts of the gifts and bequests clause on community based groups.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. I was referring to the matrix of deceit, Senator Campbell. Given the sequacious way in which you have responded this afternoon, it is clear that this government is demonstrably engaged in a `policy of blatant, cynical fraud', as a recent article pointed out quoting a senior minister. The deceit was described as `sickening'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is embarking upon a policy of funding various projects on the basis <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of special treatment to attract support for the privatisation of Telstra. Special amounts of money have been used to fund projects in Tasmania and Queensland. Recently, we saw this example followed in pork&hyphen;barrelling in Western Australia in regard to salinity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I simply ask: is this not the sort of action that is likely to provoke a constitutional challenge? There does appear to be a prima facie case that the administration of moneys under this proposed trust is being presented to us in a discriminatory manner in that preferential treatment is being given to particular states and particular regions within states. There is an opportunity here to actually spend money in a way that takes away parliamentary and budgetary accountability. It should be resisted by this parliament and it ought to be resisted by all senators within this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed trust fund will involve restrictions on the level of parliamentary scrutiny. It will involve the delegation of parliamentary responsibilities to a trust fund. But the committee report clearly indicates that there are serious deficiencies in the composition of the trust board, the inherent rigidities in the trust fund allocations and in the range of recurrent initiatives which are in fact capital expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite clearly, a discriminatory policy is being followed by this government for blatant political reasons. This government presented itself to the Australian people prior to the election as the defenders of the environment. Now, after the election, the opposite policy is being pursued. Before the election, there was a commitment that they would spend more on the environment; after the election, there are cuts to environmental programs of some 13 per cent. Before the election, we saw commitments to the environment; after the election, we saw proposals to establish a fund for purposes which should be funded directly out of the budget, out of consolidated revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no excuse for the establishment of this fund, other than the blatant ransom that is being demanded in terms of the blackmail associated with the privatisation of Telstra. There is an extricable link between those two propositions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the time of the election, this Natural Heritage Trust Fund was meant to get the Democrats and the Greens to vote with the government on the flogging off of Telstra to the private sector. But that did not work. It <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6822"> netted two Independents instead. While the Greens and Democrats could see it for what it was&mdash;a slush fund for environmental purposes in various states and not germane to the real responsibility of this government to legislate, to adequately fund from consolidated revenue for the protection of the environment&mdash;the Independents have apparently been drawn in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A committee was set up to look at the proposed legislation for the establishment of a Natural Heritage Trust of Australia, which will have something like $1 billion to disburse over the next few years. That committee has made a series of recommendations. What we are discussing here is the government's response to those recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To sum it up, the government has simply brushed them all off. It is as if the committee has wasted its time. It might have saved the money. The report from that committee at first put its thumb on the real fault in this so-called Natural Heritage Trust Fund, and that is that it sets up a board to determine where $200 million, $300 million or $400 million a year is going to be spent repairing the Australian environment. It calls itself a board. Most people would think that when you have a board you have a series of people with expert skills who will be able to expertly decide both the priorities for the spending of that money and then how best to spend it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But nothing of the kind. We have two ministers, self-appointed under this legislation, calling themselves a board. It is a sham. We have the minister for cutting down trees and digging up things from the House of Representatives, Mr Anderson, and in here the minister for stonewalling against any attempts to protect the environment but going under the name of the Minister for the Environment, Senator Hill. These two people are going to sit together and determine the fortunes of Australia's environment and in particular the money from the sale of Telstra, which is supposed to be put across to the protection of the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have found already, what we have heard already today in the Senate, is that it is not going to be determined on environmental priorities; it is going to be determined on <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> political pressuring. Already we are seeing the influence of the Independents, not least Senator Harradine, in being able to determine where that money goes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might call into question Senator Harradine's expertise in approaching this so-called board to determine where the environment might benefit from the spending of moneys. This is the same Senator Harradine who, as I said earlier today in this House, used his influence in the flooding of Lake Pedder, who stood aside, to put the best tilt on it, as the Franklin River was put up for destruction and who has actively worked over decades now for the destruction of Tasmania's world heritage, national estate and nationally significant forests and wildlife, including rainforests and the tall eucalypt forests, which are the tallest flowering plants on the face of the planet. This is the man who is having mega&hyphen;influence on this government's disbursement of what are public funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The board idea says that the committee should be looked at again. Would it not be better if, instead of having these two ministers&mdash;who, prior to their entry into this place, at best had no environmental expertise at all&mdash;you had a range of people who were the brains trust of Australia, if you like, in how best to spend what meagre funds there are available in trying to repair the enormous damage done to Australia's environment by past malpractice? `No', says the government. `We are not going to take that recommendation. We want to keep our fingers on the purse strings to this slush fund.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is nothing more or less than that. So they turn down the first and most important recommendation, which is to try to get this money, which is being set up under patent political favouritism and influence buying, out of the arena of political favouritism and influence buying. And the government says straight up, `No, we will not have a bar of that.' Of course it is not going to have a bar of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6823"> Then there is a series of recommendations from the Senate committee about how the expertise of Australia's environmental experts might be used, put in various ways to the government. What is the government's re sponse? It says, and I quote&mdash;and I think this has to be done tongue in cheek:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government is committed to the principle of encouraging devolution of funding and decision making to the lowest practicable level.</PARA>
<PARA>Well, they have got it. They have got Senator Hill and they have got Minister Anderson. They have devolved it to the lowest practicable level at the outset. That is where they want to keep it. They do not want to elevate it to expert import&mdash;not on your life. They want to keep it in their own hands. Shame on this government that this committee ever sat and challenged it, because all it has ended up doing is wasting public money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I could go into the other recommendations made by the committee. Without exception, the government has turned them down. It has said: `We are not going to be influenced by a Senate committee. This is political decision making. It is not about the environment. It is not about delivering to the Australian people good value for their money. It is about us politically determining how to get Telstra into the marketplace, out of the hands of the Australian people and into the hands of the select and wealthy few who can line their pockets with the profits coming from it in the years ahead. At the same time it is a sweetener which was necessary back at election time. We will set up this Natural Heritage Trust Fund because it is going to make us look a little green and it might make the Democrats and the Greens squirm a little in the meantime.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That ploy did not work. No-one over here is squirming. There is a lot of outrage and the ability to see this slush fund for what it is. But as I said earlier, it did unfortunately net a couple of Independents, including the new green guru from Tasmania, Senator Harradine. I do not think the environment is going to get much value out of his advice. I do not think the government is going to do any better in the future because clearly it is not interested in getting proper environmental advice; it is interested in getting political favours and kudos out of this in other ways.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of this, there is this government response to the recommendation from the committee that the matter of needs-based <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> funding be brought to the attention of the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government notes the argument put forward by the Tasmanian representatives that funding from the Trust should be based on priority need.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Allocations from the Trust to individual States will be determined as program objectives and priorities are further developed, and will vary between programs, depending on the purpose of the program and the nature of the problems to be addressed, consistent with policies set out in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Saving Our Natural Heritage</EMPHASIS> , <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Reviving the Heartland</EMPHASIS>  and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sustainable Agriculture</EMPHASIS> .</PARA>
<PARA>We have a lot of words there. All that means is that we do not need to look at needs-based funding for the various states and territories. We do not want the arguments that environments in some areas are more in need of spending than environments elsewhere. We want to keep totally under political control the disbursement of these funds, regardless of what the environment needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I return to a point made by a previous speaker. This fund is tiddlywinks compared to the huge job of repairing the vast damage done to Australia's soils, vegetation, biodiversity, coastlines and urban areas in the last two centuries.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on this government response to the report on the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill 1996 prepared by the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee, of which I was a member. First of all, I refer again to the report, which makes it very clear in paragraph 1.5 that the opposition and Democrat members of the committee, in dealing with the actual legislation before the legislative committee, in no way could be taken as supporting the principal position put by the government for the sale of Telstra to fund the environment issues contained in the government's policy. That is stated clearly in paragraph 1.5. Once we had stated that, the committee members did deal with specific issues. But we should in no way be taken as having weakened in our absolute opposition to the sale of Telstra to pay for the environment or any other policy programs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6824">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have just had a quick glance at the government's response. After that disclaimer, the committee's recommendations were unanimous. The recommendations by the coalition, Labor and Democrat senators on the detail of the bill and its administration were unanimous. Government members supported them. However, in the government's response, I note that on several occasions the government has rejected these unanimous recommendations in detail. They have accepted that the words `board' and `trust' be changed and that it will now be called the Natural Heritage Ministerial Board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, they have rejected that the Minister for the Environment be the chair. They have rejected that a proper advisory panel of about eight experts from a wide range of backgrounds should advise the two ministers who make up the board. They have rejected that out of hand and will rely on a hotchpotch of other committees, which means that there will be no coherent advice going to the ministers. I suspect that the ministers want that. There is a rejection of needs-based funding, which is contained in recommendation No. 10. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that the matter of needs-based funding be brought to the attention of the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories.</PARA>
<PARA>That has been slipped away from. The government response states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Allocations from the Trust to individual States will be determined as program objectives and priorities are further developed.</PARA>
<PARA>Generally, the government has slipped away from most of the important recommendations. This raises the issue of the sincerity of this government in how it is going to use the Natural Heritage Trust and the proceeds from the one-third sale of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report became irrelevant today when the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) announced in the Senate at the end of the second reading debate on the privatisation of Telstra that he was making further adjustments to the program and that further arrangements had been taken to suit particular conditions applied by Senator Harradine and Senator Colston. Senator Harradine wanted more money for Tasmania. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> As a Tasmanian senator, one can understand that that is an issue he would be pushing. Another $100 million would be going to the Natural Heritage Trust to take account of Tasmania's special needs. That is what we think it needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No detail was given by the minister today of how that extra $100 million will be allocated, such as whether it will be all for Tasmania or allocated on a priority basis for other issues around Australia. It was left wide open. There was no commitment to write as an amendment into the privatisation bill the programs that would be funded from the extra $100 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, it raises the whole issue that this has been a political fix. The government has negotiated a political fix in this outcome to take account of how to get a majority vote through the Senate against the principal opposition by the Labor Party, the Democrats and the Greens, who have always said that the environment is too important to be tied to the outcome of an assets sale. You do not tie the funding of defence to the outcome of an assets sale. You do not tie the funding of health, education or community welfare to the outcome of an assets sale. However, apparently the environment is tied to the outcome of an assets sale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also seen today that the commitment for the extra $100 million is probably over four years. What happens after that? Will the government want to sell more than one-third of Telstra, or will there be a rapid decline after four years in the funding of the environment by this government if the government is still in place in four years? They are relevant questions that we in the opposition will still ask Senator Harradine and Senator Colston to look at. This funding arrangement is only for four years from the proceeds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The remaining $300 million, even on the government's generous estimate of earning 10 per cent in the trust for ever and a day thereafter, means that, at the most, it would earn $30 million per year. There is no way that you can fund all the environmental needs of this country from $30 million per year. Substantial general revenue would have to be <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6825"> spent to meet the environmental needs of this country, which all Australians would support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no mention in the government's policy about how they will raise the rest of that money after four years to supplement the measly $30 million a year. That is all left unsaid. The government believes that, by expending about $700 million over the next four years from the sale of Telstra, all the environmental problems in Australia will be fixed and that, subsequent to that, $30 million a year on the investment of $300 million will suffice for all the rest. In all of the hearings we had on this heritage bill, when we asked experts, `Do you believe that in four years there will still be demand for expenditure of hundreds of millions of dollars for overcoming the environmental problems of this country?', every expert of any credibility said, `You will need an ongoing program of increasing proportions, increasing size'&mdash;not diminishing&mdash;`to meet these commitments.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, when we dealt with the issue of the salinity and the vegetation on the Murray-Darling Basin, all the experts said that, with the of money coming out of the natural vegetation program and the salinity program, the problem could not be dealt with and solved within the next four years. That would just be the beginning. They said that we were talking about decades of expenditure to overcome the soil degradation, the salinity problems, in the Murray-Darling Basin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also had exposed in the last few days a letter from the Premier of Western Australia to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) saying, `Further to our conversation in early November, you have agreed to give us $300 million at $30 million a year for the next 10 years to overcome salinity problems in Western Australia and that will be paid out of the Telstra fund.' All the money has already been committed. Is this $300 million on top of the billion or the now $1.1 billion and $350 million? Is another $300 million going on the top? That has all been left unsaid, all left unannounced, other than in a very broad application.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said today in the first part of the committee stage of the Telstra sale bill, I am astonished that a wily old campaigner like <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Senator Harradine would agree to allow the bill to go through without insisting that the increased money for Tasmania, the regional development of infrastructure for telecommunications, would be other than written into the bill to guarantee that it is achieved and that if he is so keen on the redeemable preference share that would not also be written into the bill. Surely he would have ensured that if he had felt so strongly about it, rather than having it referred to a committee, with the government not proclaiming the bill until after the committee reported. The government will proclaim the bill; it will chuck his report straight into the bin and it will take no notice of it. Once the government gets the bill through on the third reading, there is no way it will in any way hold it up by waiting for a Senate committee report. They will go ahead immediately and consign to Senator Harradine's waste bin of history his idea of redeemable preference shares. The government's response is a very mediocre response indeed. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 10 November 1994, the Hon Brian Howe MP, then Minister for Housing and Regional Development, wrote to the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories inviting the committee to inquire into, and report on, Draft Amendment No. 14 to the National Capital Plan. The committee accepted the reference and tabled its report in October 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Draft Amendment No. 14 refers to an area of land bounded by Oaks Estate, the ACT&hyphen;NSW border, Canberra Avenue and the Molonglo River Corridor. The area is included in the Broadacre Areas described in the National Capital Plan.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In general, the National Capital Plan does not permit industry as a land use in Broadacre Areas. However, the Canberra Tannery and Canberra Abattoir and Queanbeyan Sewage Treatment Plant were already operating there when the National Capital Plan came into operation in December 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Capital Plan specifies a range of permitted land uses in Broadacre Areas which includes hazardous and offensive industries restricted to the area in question, subject to environmental <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> assessment. The Plan also foreshadows that siting of future industry, defence installations, institutions and other activities requiring significant large sites, may be considered for Broadacre Areas in the long term.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Draft Amendment No. 14 sought to amend the National Capital Plan by deleting "hazardous and offensive" to expand the range of uses permitted in the Broadacre Area, marked A, B, C and D on the attached Figure, to encompass industries generally. The relevant permitted use would have read "Industries restricted to the land to the west of Oaks Estate on the north side of Canberra Avenue and subject to environmental assessment."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Draft Amendment was proposed in order to make the National Capital Plan consistent with the Territory Plan and to facilitate the redevelopment and upgrading of the site of the ageing and obsolete Canberra abattoir. The formulation of detailed development parameters within the framework of the general land use policy is a matter for the territory government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recommendations of the majority of the committee have been accepted. As a result, the amendment will be revised to restrict the area available for industries to the areas marked A, B and D on the attached figure.</PARA>

<STATE> (Queensland)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(4.33 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the annual report of the Australian Trade Union Training Authority. My colleague Senator Cooney spoke on this report last week. In his opening remarks, Senator Cooney referred to the fact that this was probably the penultimate report of this organisation, as it seems to have been killed by the current government. It is a report worthy of note. It is worth looking at what the Trade Union Training Authority has achieved over a long period of time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If one turns to page 12 of the report, one can see there a reflection of the increase in trade union training that has taken place from 1990-91 through to 1995-96, where last year 5,714 training days were used. The significant point is that, of those 5,714 days, 4,653 days were used through the union training scheme which is under the umbrella of TUTA. That is a very significant number of days being devoted to the education of workers in the workplace as to their rights and their privileges. This training particularly fosters the development of industrial relations skills, negotiation skills, dispute resolution skills and life skills&mdash;including confidence and belief in themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The union training schemes which I personally became associated with proved to be of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> great benefit to those people who showed a development in their own right. The training showed that they have a positive part to play in the work force in the development of a safe and healthy workplace and in the development of a cooperative spirit at the workplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at some of the issues that were covered in those courses, with some 20 unions taking advantage of the union training scheme during the year and with 200 trainers registered to conduct courses. They addressed issues such as: what an award is; what the actual law pertaining to the workplace is; dispute resolution; equal employment opportunity, which affects so many women who are now in our work force; enterprise bargaining, which seems to have been killed off by the workplace relations legislation; negotiation; superannuation; occupational health and safety; communication skills; the Industrial Commission; the role of unions; sexual harassment&mdash;and so the list goes on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report is really a sad report in one way in that we see the government trying to deny to people these basic skills and trying to deny to them the right to attain at least a minimum understanding of what their involvement in the workplace should be. What is most poignant in the industry from which I came&mdash;the retail industry&mdash;was that there were so many women and so many young people involved in the industry who gained their education through the union training scheme under the umbrella of TUTA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were full&hyphen;time, part&hyphen;time and casual employees; there was no discrimination as to who was taught their rights and privileges. The courses served to break down barriers with management. They provided people with skills that they would not otherwise have been provided with, and in many cases this helped people to achieve promotion. It cut down in some instances a suspicion that was held by the employers about what industrial relations was about and, in all, lifted a veil that is cast upon the trade union movement as some sort of demonic organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was quite clear that the people who were educated here were the battlers. They were the people who were equipped in some small way with the ability to defend themselves. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6829"> The government's decision to axe TUTA will be lamented. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the motion to take note of the 1995&hyphen;96 report of the Australian Trade Union Training Authority. In doing so, I commend Senator Hogg for his very important comments. The Trade Union Training Authority, as Senator Hogg has just reminded the Senate, has been the subject of an excision from the industrial relations legislation as a result of the workplace relations bill. Senator Hogg says it has been vilified, and it has.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had a lot of debate in this chamber over the last few weeks about education matters. This government has talked about the billions of dollars they have been prepared to put into education, but in this case educating employees, workers, about their rights is a low priority for this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having had personal experience of and involvement in trade union training courses delivered under the auspices of the Trade Union Training Authority, and particularly with courses delivered by my organisation, funded by them in accordance with the guidelines laid down by the Trade Union Training Authority, I can say that very important educational outcomes came from the funding of the Trade Union Training Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is remarkable to note that there are many, many people in the community who have no idea of their rights, who do not know what an award is, who learn about superannuation and how it affects them by attending courses run by the Trade Union Training Authority. I am talking about people who have been, in the main, elected by their fellow workers to represent them in negotiations with their employer. So these are the people that workers in a great many occupations have put forward and say, `We don't know enough about these employment issues, we want you to represent us.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Trade Union Training Authority has for many years performed a service to the community in equipping these people to go out and represent their fellows at a workplace level. This government has talked about the focus of negotiations being at the workplace. Look at the name of the bill that they put <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> through this parliament&mdash;workplace relations. What do they want to do about facilitating negotiations at a workplace level? Absolutely nothing. They are taking away from Australia an organisation funded by the government which equipped workers to represent themselves. So on the one hand the government says, `Let us have a focus on the workplace,' and on the other hand we have a vast working community which have</PARA>
<PARA>been given no instruction, no training in terms of their legal rights, in terms of how to negotiate, in terms of the issues of negotiation, in terms of the complexities of the industrial relations system that applies to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Hogg referred to the great majority of the workplace representatives who were trained as having been trained directly by employee organisations through funding from the Trade Union Training Authority. Obviously, that was a measure to get a better result from the dollars spent without having to rely upon the total infrastructure of the Trade Union Training Authority at its Clyde Cameron College and at its facilities in other states. In fact, the Trade Union Training Authority had wound down a number of its facilities. In particular, in my state of Tasmania, it had closed the TUTA centre and relied exclusively on hiring facilities, bringing trainers from interstate and also on the employee organisations providing facilities and getting a cost&hyphen; effective service out of that method of funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There needs to be some thinking about this. If this government is sincere about wanting a workplace focus, they have to give some thought to how they are going to equip people to deal with these issues at a workplace level. I commend this report. This is an organisation that should have been fostered, not guillotined by the bill that this government has put through this parliament.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also rise to speak to this motion to take note of the 1995&hyphen;96 report of the Australian Trade Union Training Authority. The authority has played an absolutely magnificent role in the training of workplace delegates, occupational health and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6830"> safety representatives, and participants in the consultative committee process that is one of the fundamental platforms of enterprise bargaining.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Trade Union Training Authority was an organisation that really went to the workers. Their programs were conducted not only in all the major cities, but where there was a demand they would actually go out to the workplaces and conduct the courses there. The sorts of things that are raised in a Trade Union Training Authority program or course are things like: what are your employer's legislative requirements? What are the regulations associated with occupational health and safety requirements? What is an award and what does an award contain?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While it is easy for senators to stand up in this chamber and to debate for 53 hours, or thereabouts, issues with respect to awards and allowable matters, unless the workers out there know what is in an award and what it means, what we say is irrelevant. Unless workers are aware of their rights, what point is there in having legislation? What point is there in having minimum standards? What point is there in having allowable matters if there are working people out there who are not aware of their entitlements and rights under those particular awards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">TUTA provided a way to educate working people. It provided the means by which unions could ensure that their representatives got the right information and got the facts. I have heard all too often coalition senators in this chamber saying that unions present a somewhat biased position. What do they think TUTA did? TUTA provided an independent education service for working people to assist them in understanding their rights. That is what this government has done away with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has done away with it because the government knows that if working people know their rights it has a problem. It is quite obvious that this government is displaying sequacious behaviour, following the pattern of listening to the advocacy of the big employer groups. There is no doubt that the motivation of this government in abandoning TUTA is to do what the big end of town has asked them to do.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a great shame because, in doing so, the government has blatantly removed the rights of people to have access to basic information&mdash;information that goes to forming the matrix of the rights of working people. A number of employer organisations advocate their own beliefs through various mechanisms, but this government is dismantling every single mechanism available to working people and to the trade union movement to educate their own.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is ironic that we are looking at the dismantling of TUTA in the same week in which we saw this government make the most appalling changes to restrict the access of people to higher education.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An economist group, the Economist Intelligence Unit, recently produced a report titled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's Foreign Investment Challenges: the Harsh Reality of a Foreign Investment Perspective on Australia</EMPHASIS>. It demonstrated this government's chicanery on the question of industry policy. The clear warning to Canberra from this report is that, if the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) does not develop an interventionist industry policy, Australia will lose out to its Asian rivals for the new investment dollar. The sequacious members of the opposition who sit back and allow this to happen should be condemned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen almost a third of Austrade's budget and EMDG cut coming into this next 12 months. We will not have any industry policy. We will not have a say in what industries we want to develop. We will not have any incentives and support such as Austrade provides at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You might ask who was involved in this report. It included BP Australia, Caterpillar, Citibank, Dow Chemicals, DuPont Australia, Edison Mission Energy, Glaxo Wellcome, Hewlett&hyphen;Packard, Kodak, Mobil, Pilkington and Uncle Ben's. Those companies are all actively saying to this government, `When are we going to get an industry policy?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The worst feature these investors found is that in Canberra there is no commitment to industry. But here in the Senate, there is a chance for us to stop the nonsense and make the Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Costello) face reality. What we need is for the Senate to oppose the proposed cuts to export industry research and development and retraining programs. The<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> </EMPHASIS>report said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad to see my friend on the other side is taking an interest in Austrade. I would encourage him to do so. It is very important for senators from both sides of the chamber to be interested in Australia's export performance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My comments basically relate to the direction on which Australia's export efforts should be based. I think it is always very tempting for people to say, `We will stick with the tried and true industries. We will stick with the manufacturing sector,' and so on. There are areas in the manufacturing industries where Australia is very efficient, particularly in the processing of food.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to also look at the new opportunities that are available for this nation when it comes to exporting services. Let me explain why I say that. The danger we have in this country is that labour becomes a commodity. My friends from the opposition would understand my concern because if labour is a commodity people get paid commodity prices for their labour and that is not in the interests of the workers nor in the interests of the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we do have is a large number of people in Australia who have received 12 years of education and, irrespective of what state, generally the education is of a reasonable standard. We have a higher educational level than many of our neighbours, so we have the opportunity to be exporting services to them. Services mean that we can return a higher rate for the labour than we could get in the manufacturing sector. We really should be looking at how we can utilise our language and technology skills and our proximity to the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6832"> region and turn Australia into a major service centre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should pay much more attention, when we talk about exporting education, to exporting vocational education. Hitherto, we have done very well&mdash;as others would know&mdash;exporting services in relation to university education. As Senator Brownhill would know, the universities in Asia are improving in standard and the government attitude in many of those places&mdash;correct me if I am wrong&mdash;is that they would prefer to see people to go to their own national universities for their undergraduate degrees.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EU4">Senator O'CHEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is correct. But at the vocational training level, the other countries in the region cannot match what we have to offer, which has been developed over a very long period of time. We have a lot of potential to sell vocational training.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam Acting Deputy President Reynolds, being from North Queensland, you would understand the high contribution that has been made to vocational education by the Institute of TAFE in North Queensland. You would also be aware that, in the last 18 months to two years, we have significantly improved their export earnings. I have worked with them. We have put together a strategy to target vocational education in Papua New Guinea and the South Pacific. That is starting to pay off. Vocational education can be very valuable for other TAFE colleges around the country and for the private sector, because our neighbours do not have that capacity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another area that we should be concentrating on is the sale of services in things like data processing. Given the large body of people who speak English very well in Australia and the fact that most computer programs are in English, we ought to be a major service centre in Asia for the insurance industry and the credit card industry&mdash;for example, with Master Card, Visa, American Express and Diners Club, all the transactions that are made have to be processed. They should be processed here in Australia. We can utilise our proximity, our time zone and all of those things in our favour to get those exports from here.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All I am saying to the Senate is: yes, manufacturing is important, and food processing is important&mdash;as a National Party senator I understand that very well. I am also saying that if we are to ensure that the workers of Australia receive more than commodity wages for their labour, we have to move them into high value jobs, particularly in the export of services. We have some national advantages here that the rest of the region cannot match. That is something that Austrade should focus on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing I would just say very briefly is that we need to make sure that our flow of investment matches our flow of trade. It is sad that we do a reasonable amount of trade with South&hyphen;East Asia but we have an insufficient amount of outward investment by Australian companies into the region. It creates a perception in the region that we are not interested in the long haul. This nation is interested in the region in the long haul, but Austrade should be more active in encouraging Australian companies, not just to sell goods and services into Asia, but also to make investments there, because future trade earnings will be based on the back of those investments. I know another senator wants to speak, so I will conclude my remarks there.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak to the Australian Trade Commission annual report 1995&hyphen;96 as well. Before I turn to the full remarks that I wish to make, I acknowledge the two previous speakers in this debate; I welcome Senator O'Chee to the debate on Austrade.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a former minister for trade&mdash;and therefore having ministerial responsibility for Austrade&mdash;I say that Austrade is a very fine organisation. It is the international business intelligence unit for Australia that provides the lowdown on what is happening in the market economies around the world for Australian small business. Small business by definition is not big enough to be able to penetrate what is happening in a whole range of markets&mdash;particularly complex markets, as Asian markets often are, where different cultures and languages hold sway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Austrade is the body that peers into those markets for Australian small business. That is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6833"> why I think it is outrageous that Austrade's budget was cut so dramatically in this year's budget. That move limits the ability of Austrade to do the job for small business that it is there to do. Indeed, the sequacious remarks of backbenchers on the other side showed that they had overlooked that point, and I think that is a pity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the question of services, Senator O'Chee is right: 80 per cent of Australians are employed in the services sector and about 72 per cent of the Australian GDP is derived from the services sector. It is the biggest single sector in Australian industry and it is an area that we are extremely competent in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have achieved a lot of positive outcomes for the balance of payments in the education sector selling those services. I might say that the medical sector is another area in which we are extraordinarily competitive in this region. We have not achieved the same level of performance there, but that sector is working on it and I encourage its efforts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is a major financial hub as well. We are not necessarily, at this point, recognised as being a major financial centre for the region. One of the things that the former government sought to do with the innovation statement which was brought down in December last year&mdash;in fact, it was brought down on this date exactly 12 months ago&mdash;was to try to set up Sydney, or some other major Australian capital, as a major regional financial centre for this region. That required a number of small policy changes. Until Australia is seen internationally in those ways, the finances, the packaging of new projects, the new companies and all the rest of it in this region will go through Hong Kong and, after the takeover of Hong Kong, probably through Shanghai or Singapore exchanges&mdash;they will not be going through Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a global economy now. For Australia to be competitive, we have to put our hand up and fight for our position in that economy. It requires private sector drive, but government support behind that drive, to realise those objectives. Sydney could be a world ranking financial hub for the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region, but it does require a bit of government <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> backing to help it achieve that. It is a pity that the innovation statement was cut back in that respect as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Conroy has put his finger on the matrix of associated problems here. We have had the drama of the cuts to the DIFF program, and we have seen how that has put back Australia's trade position in this region. We have had cuts to the export market development grants scheme. For a government that supports small business, this is an amazing piece of chicanery on its behalf. This move has meant that the small business area has had their access to export incentives reduced. We have seen the abandonment of ITES, which is the least understandable of all, because this is a revolving fund scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen as well that the government, which rode to the election promising Australian industry that it would engage in bilateral trade negotiations, was not able to say what it has done about that when confronted with questions in the estimates process. This is something they are working on and maybe will tell us about in the future. The government made a big feature of saying that bilateral trade negotiations were the new departure it was going to bring about. So far, there has been no work on that subject and, even when pressed at estimates levels, the government gives no information either.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think Austrade is an extraordinarily important organisation for Australia. I commend the chairman, Alan Jackson, Nixon Apple, Elizabeth Bryan, Grant Latta, Graeme Lawless, Simon Lee, Mrs Martin and Mr Unsworth&mdash;all directors&mdash;who have done a fine job for this nation.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> (Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been a wise move on the part of the government of Victoria to refer their powers in the industrial relations field to the Commonwealth.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the states are going to do that, then the Commonwealth must pick up the responsibility that that puts upon them.

I wanted to refer in particular to pages 87 to 93 of the report which relate to the executive management of this particular subprogram.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, on page 87, senators will note that both the budget expenditure and the desired outcomes for executive management of the program are set out. Having looked at the objectives, I must say that the department has achieved remarkable successes on a very small&mdash;might I say, shoestring&mdash;budget. Actual expenditure for staffing costs for 1995-96 was only $27,300. Basically, I think that one person has been responsible for this unit, which is quite remarkable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On page 92 of the report there is a particular reference to the use by the department of various communications systems to advise members of the public about important issues and matters including enterprise agreements, flexibility, fairness and, from February 1996, information in relation to the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996. I note on page 93 of that report that, in the first two days of the actual bill and the explanatory memoranda being placed upon the Internet, there were 20,500 instances where that information was accessed. I think that is remarkable. I do not know that there would be too many other pieces of legislation which, if they were displayed on the Internet, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6835"> would be accessed on 20,500 occasions in two days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I see on page 92 the logo which appeared on the home page of the Internet: `A fair go for all'. I am hopeful that this government is not going to be taken before the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission for misleading advertising on the Internet in the future in relation to the impact of the workplace relations bill. Perhaps they will claim that, because it was amended after it was placed on the Internet, they had no responsibility for the product.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, having said that, the important aspect of the workplace relations bill that I referred to earlier this week, which is the bill that was referred to in this report, is the question of the safety net that has been set up under the legislation. That, of course, was a change from the original bill, an amended provision, and particularly applies to Australian workplace agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did speak on Wednesday on matters of public interest in relation to this matter noting the reports on the Commonwealth's submissions to the national wage case in relation to the removal from awards of classification structures or career structures and relativities on the basis that they would no longer be required or relevant in an era of enterprise bargaining. Can I say that that is fundamental to the issue of the minimum standards which have been established in the workplace relations bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to that matter, I would hope that we will not see this department advertising one thing on the Internet which, in reality, will change if the Australian Industrial Relations Commission accepts the government submission, and that the sorts of guarantees that no doubt the department is trying to advise members of the public that they are entitled to will change substantially as a result of that test.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular, I want to take note of pages 35, 36 and 37 of the report where attention is devoted to the private sector workplace reform and best practice. This is something that is absolutely necessary if the Australian economy is to thrive and it will not be achieved in an environment where there is confrontation, as I believe will come about as a result of the workplace relations bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report espouses what the objectives were prior to the change of government in March. The objectives were very laudable. One of them was to `contribute to the development of industrial relations arrangements that improve Australia's economic performance through the development of a more cooperative and productive workplace culture.' That is not going to be achieved under the current Workplace Relations Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another objective was to `promote the adoption of the government's industrial relations policies including workplace performance, best practice and workplace bargaining.' That objective is very important because I believe one of the ways Australia will gain an edge on its rival nations will be at the leading edge if we have the skills, if we have the technique, and if we can develop the quality within our industry to promote a better product at a smarter and cheaper price.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the objectives also espoused in this report was to `maximise community understanding of employment rights and responsibilities under federal awards, agreements and legislation and to secure better observance of these and related obligations.' This was not just mere words. It was, as the report highlights at page 202 through to page 212, backed up by cold hard cash. The Australian public should be aware of the wide range of organisations that were funded through the department to achieve best practice and to achieve workplace bargaining in a cooperative environment, a cooperative spirit.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>Out of the great matrix located just down the road here, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, has come their 1995&hyphen;96 annual report, on which I wish to make a few remarks. This report, 460 pages long, is comprehensive in that it covers the great range of activities that we are involved in around the world in foreign affairs and trade. In the short time I have available, I would like to refer to a couple of these.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, the report notes the great role that Australia, I might say under the previous government, played in the development of the chemical weapons convention. That is of course something Australia has led the world in. Similarly, it notes during the past year the signing of the South&hyphen;East Asian nuclear weapons free zone arrangements&mdash;again, an area where the previous Labor government under the previous foreign minister, Gareth Evans, showed such pioneering initiatives. Gareth Evans was certainly no sequacious Minister for Foreign Affairs. He was out there pioneering, not just following the leader and being a long way behind like, unfortunately, our current minister, Mr Downer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, the last big issue in our own region was the French resumption of nuclear testing. We came through that difficult time with the final decision by France to become a signatory to the South Pacific nuclear weapons free zone arrangements&mdash;great achievements that continued the long leading <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> role that Australia under Minister Gareth Evans played in foreign affairs and similarly in trade under former Minister Bob McMullan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report which covers the years 1995&hyphen;96 largely reflects the great work done in these areas by the previous Labor government. It is appropriate that two photographs, I think, sum up the comparison between the previous performance and what we are now seeing. For instance, one photograph shows then Senator Evans and Indonesian foreign minister Ali Alatas signing the very important Australian&hyphen;Indonesian security agreement. The second photograph shows the current Minister for Trade, Tim Fischer, inspecting a plate of oysters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the current government has come to office we have seen one piece of chicanery after another, typified by some of the events that happened today with Telstra; but also in foreign affairs and trade through the removal of DIFF. This has been dealt with in another report but it clearly is recognised within this report as a very important aspect of our promotion of export trade as well as part of our overseas aid program. What happened? Not long after coming to office, the government simply abolished the scheme with no notice, really, to the companies involved. We are still waiting to hear the reason why, as are at least 70 to 80 companies after having invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in these programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report covers, very substantially, many of the important issues around the world, for example, Latin America, which is now the second fastest growing economic area in the world behind Asia. It is an area on which Australia will have to focus more in the future. In my capacity as chair of the Senate foreign affairs committee, along with other members, I met with Latin American ambassadors last week to further consider how we can promote trade, cooperation and contact between our countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, the report looks at the incredible change within Europe and the impact that the changes there are having on such areas as economics, trade and particularly our security. It is a very fine report recognising fine <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6838"> achievements of the previous government and the previous ministers. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA>I urge honourable senators and anyone with an interest in family studies to note the report of the Australian institute. I had the great pleasure of having ministerial responsibility for it and I note in the report that the institute is now working with Minister Moylan. It has been a very interesting program of trying to get serious research done to assist governments to make policies in the family area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the most important points here is that the National Child Protection Clearing House became a responsibility of the Australian Institute of Family Studies. There is much here that would assist people who are concerned about the best ongoing formulation of policy for child protection. It is quite clearly an area where there is going to be a need for a major statement and major addressing of policies. I believe this report would help.

<PARA>This government has been absolutely duplicitous in its intentions towards the elderly in this country. We have all become painfully <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> aware of this because of the department of health's working party report for the minister, now called the `minister on nursing homes', Mrs Moylan, who used to be called the Minister for Family Services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This minister, Mrs Moylan, claims that the nursing home system is under stress and needs capital contributions to build and refurbish ageing infrastructure. But, of course, it is not helped when John Howard and Peter Costello remove $500 million from capital funding for nursing homes in a budget that they claim would not hurt the poor, the sick and the vulnerable.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He called you senator; you are a senator. He is very well mannered. The point is that Mr Howard and Mr Costello have sold out the aged in our community. That is the truth of the matter. The issue before the Senate, the question that senators are looking at is whether sick, elderly, frail people&mdash;after a lifetime of contributing to this country, after working hard, after being so important in making an contribution to the Australian community&mdash;are to be told that they might be sick, they might be elderly but they are going to have to sell the family home to pay for a health care service that should fundamentally and primarily be funded by government through the taxes that those people have paid throughout their working lives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth is that 60 per cent of people who go into a nursing home go directly from hospital care. You have no choice when you go into a nursing home. You are often infirm. Senator Herron, the minister at the table, ought to know more than most, because of his experience as a medical practitioner, the sorts of reasons why the elderly go into nursing homes. Obviously, Senator Herron does not have the opportunity to shop around.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand why you will not respond&mdash;because you are so guilty about what the government, which you are a member of, has done. This is a time, when people need nursing home care, when a government has a responsibility to hold out its hand and help. It is a time when people who have made a great contribution to society, who have paid their taxes, have their lifetime of contributions returned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But Mr John Howard's government does not see aged care as a particularly important role for government. The Minister for Family <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Services (Mrs Moylan) in the House of Representatives on Tuesday agreed that nursing home charges should be left up to market forces, that fees should be negotiated between the patient and the nursing home proprietor. She did not deny in a question this week that up-front fees might be as high as $80,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This same Mrs Moylan is weasel-worded in the extreme when she says that the government will not force anyone to sell their own home. Documents that the opposition has obtained show precisely that it is the market that will force people to sell their own homes. The Department of Health and Family Services have ascertained&mdash;no doubt through the minister's own request&mdash;that 75 per cent of elderly Australians are able to fund a $26,000 up-front entry fee and 63 per cent of these will fund it through the sale of their house. That is in their own documents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam Acting Deputy President, I take a point of order. There is no minister at the table to hear this very important debate on elderly Australians. This is indicative, in my view, of the contempt that this government has for aged people in our community.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was exposing the Department of Health and Family Services in their own words&mdash;documents that have been produced by the opposition in relation to the fact that 63 per cent of the 75 per cent of elderly Australians will be funding the $26,000 up-front fee through the sale of their own home. That is in government documents. I would also like to draw on another government department, the Department of Finance, and its contribution to the National Commission of Audit when the government in its early days was just cranking up the pay-as-you-go approach, the pay-as-you-go option, in the health area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr John Howard, after the budget, saw no reason why people should not pay for their own nursing home care. He said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper on 31 August that it was fair and reasonable to say to a person who is going into a nursing home that `you should borrow some money against that house and, if it's not paid before you die, it will be paid out of your estate'. They are Mr Howard's words. It sounds like de facto death duties to me. But yesterday in the House of Representatives, the Prime Minister confirmed that he regarded money being taken out of someone's estate to pay for a health service as the repayment of a debt, not a death duty. The Prime Minister, out of his own mouth, has confirmed that when you are old and infirm, the government expects that, along with the doctor, nurse and social worker on <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> your aged care assessment team, you will have to have a bank manager and perhaps a real estate valuer. They are the two new members of your aged care assessment team. That is the future of nursing home care according to the Liberal Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister might see it as merely a pay-when-you-go debt, but we regard the Minister for Family Services&mdash;a junior minister in their outfit&mdash;as really being the minister responsible for the invidious duty of pushing through a de facto death duty on the aged and infirm. No-one else in Australian society has to pay for their health care in this way, just the aged and infirm. It is almost like&mdash;I think Senator Conroy would be interested in this&mdash;the aged and infirm having a tattoo saying, `I am aged and infirm.'</PARA>

It is an extraordinary ask, an extraordinary demand, on the part of this government. In the Senate, we really hear a lot of claptrap about mandates and pre-election promises. The coalition never promised up-front fees before the election. As a result, of course, this new policy of the Liberal Party has hit the aged in our society like a bombshell. It is a complete betrayal of the aged in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the 12,000 self-funded retirees will not be too pleased about being interviewed and data-matched by the Department of Social Security either. This is a group that was so intent on protecting their privacy that they led the vanguard against the Australia Card in 1988. They were not told that the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) would be nosing around their houses in typical&mdash;as the workers refurbishing her office said&mdash;Hyacinth Bouquet mode checking the value of their Royal Doulton. They were not promised that, were they? They were not promised that by Mr Howard&mdash;no way. That is the truth of the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that the Labor Party will be accused by the chorus of economic rationalists and apologists on the other side of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6841"> the chamber of having brought in a similar up-front fee system for hostel accommodation, thus making the new nursing home model okay.

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5K4">Senator FAULKNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I make the point in this contribution that I have never in my time as a senator asked any senator to withdraw any comment they have made about me; nor will I ever do so. I could not care less what you say about me, to be honest. It is no wonder that this crew over here are trying to deliberately interrupt the flow of this very important debate, because they are ashamed of what they are doing on this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, the facts are that hostel accommodation for the elderly is a choice, and it is an accommodation option. Nursing homes are a health care service and they are not an option. That is the difference. You would not want to end up in a nursing home, however good the facility was. No-one would. There is a vast difference between the two systems, although Minister Moylan, in her pathetic defence of her actions, probably wishes they were similar, because it is her only excuse when it comes to up-front fees on nursing home care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Department of Health and Family Services' own document flags that people might pay the $26,000 up&hyphen;front fee for a hostel and in a co&hyphen;located facility they may have to pay a second entry contribution when they are shifted across the corridor to a nursing home. The document states that this manipulation by some proprietors should be `monitored'. How weak can you get? Why doesn't the Department of Health and Family Services and its working group just point blank advise that the government regulate to protect the elderly person from this double whammy?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As this is motion indicates, this is the free market. What regulations are left are being ditched. Hopefully, the states pick up and carry on the responsibility. But the free market will basically dictate that, in many cases, the elderly will pay twice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Anyone who has been involved in the field of aged care will remember the absolute horror conditions that existed prior to the election of the Hawke government. I hope that is something that would be acknowledged by those on the other side of the chamber. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> The Giles report in 1985 revealed a national disaster when it came to our nation's elderly and conditions which pertained in private nursing homes. I would encourage those opposite to read that report. It was written when market forces were in control of the aged care system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor government created a national system so that national standards were set. Regulation and accreditation made sure that standards were lifted. We poured billions of dollars into the aged care system to improve conditions, and those conditions did improve. We inherited an appalling aged care system left to us by a succession of previous coalition governments. Between 1985 and 1996, we put more than $12 billion into Australian nursing homes in both recurrent and capital funding. If you cut capital funding back to the tune of $500 million, as your vindictive government has done, and if you loosen the grip on national standards, as your government wants to do, you return to the appalling pre&hyphen;1985 days. If you allow market forces to choose the patient&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">None of this inhumane policy was promised prior to the election by the Liberal Party, who were into the politics of the big con.

Do not worry about market forces, they just abandoned them altogether.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are about two million Australians aged over 65 and that is going to rise to some 4.8 million by 2031. These people have their own needs and requirements as well as being valued contributors to our society. We recognised that in our very comprehensive policy on older Australians which we released before the last election. The policy covered not just aged care&mdash;after all, this motion does not refer to aged care. It talks about abandoning older Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We saw very clearly how the previous government had abandoned older Australians. What did our election policy for older Australians cover? Retirement incomes, assistance to carers, stabilising Australia's health system, aged care including nursing homes and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> dementia facilities.

I will give former Senator Grimes some credit in that he tried to originally but, as soon as he was gone, dementia care went out the window with your government. You do not even know your history.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We included policies on community aged care, home and community care, and the particular needs of indigenous Australians and those living in rural and regional areas. We covered appropriate and affordable housing as well as improving employment access and voluntary work opportunities for older people, which we have implemented in the bill that is coming before the House. We talked about measures for crime and personal security, access for older people from ethnic backgrounds. The list went on and on, for 30 pages of detail. We contrast that with half a page of motherhood statements from the Labor government of the time, which runs to just over 200 words, I think. There is not a word in there about the crises of capital funding and of nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In May 1994, the former government received the Gregory report after Professor Gregory had investigated 150 nursing homes. He concluded that 75 per cent of homes needed fixing or rebuilding to meet Australian design standards, that 70 per cent of homes needed fixing or rebuilding to meet the Commonwealth outcome standards, that 13 per cent of homes did not meet fire authority standards and that 39 per cent of residents were in rooms with four or more beds. That is your concern for older Australians. That is the Labor Party's handing over of the baton to the incoming government. That is your record in government. After all those years, that is the crisis that you handed over to us. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6844"> You left your heads in the sand. We were left to pick up your mess.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a sound policy towards nursing homes, yet we have the Labor Party decrying the proper and responsible action that we are taking. The Minister for Family Services, Mrs Moylan, who is the responsible minister, has given guarantees to older people to protect them. Yet we have the extreme hypocrisy of the shadow minister for social security, Senator Faulkner, who never talks about social security but managed today to evince some rage. He comes into the chamber and complains about our actions to fix up the nursing homes capital crisis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would just draw your attention to an extremely important letter that appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 19 September. I will just read some very representative extracts from that letter. The first one:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact is the system already applies to hostels, so why not extend it to nursing homes? Essentially, people will be asked to make a contribution out of their assets to the upkeep of the home.</PARA>
<PARA>The second one:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is entirely fair that those who use those facilities should make a contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pity the poor soul who dies young but has to pay taxes to keep someone going in their nineties, who themselves ceased paying taxes 30 years earlier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think the welfare State can stand a bit of user&hyphen;pays, because the great levelling hand of the system can impose inequities as well as abolish them.</PARA>
<PARA>The third extract:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The taxpayer has already paid for the enormous amount of care and attention that the elderly receive. They pay through Medicare, the public hospitals, home and community care, Meals On Wheels, carers' pensions, and so on.</PARA>
<PARA>The final extract:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">My generation will inherit the largest stock of capital ever in the nation's history, and generally we earn better than our parents. It seems fair, then, to use some of that inheritance to keep up a good quality of care for those who need it.</PARA>
<PARA>That was signed by Gary Johns, Northgate, Queensland&mdash;a Labor leader. Certainly, the rabble have been left behind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> If we look at what the Labor Party did for carers, this is another area in which for 13 years there was only marginal action. Let us <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> look at what happened when our first budget was introduced. There was a press release from the Carers Association of Australia entitled `Forgotten people recognised in budget'. Doesn't that say what 13 years of Labor neglect for older people really meant?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have announced and are implementing a national carers action plan. We recognise the sacrifice and enormous contribution made to our community by carers. We have announced a range of very positive measures which they strongly support. That includes retaining the carer pension and renaming it the carer payment, and allowing recipients of the carer payment to undertake paid or voluntary work, training or study for up to 20 hours a week, rather than the existing 10 hours a week. That is very important because it maintains their involvement with the community, their connection with the paid or the unpaid work force. It retains their confidence in themselves and their status in society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, we are allowing carer payment recipients to have more respite days, moving from 42 to 52 days a year. Of course, that is very important, too. Everybody, surely, deserves at least one day a week off. It would mean nothing if  there had not also been a substantial increase in funding for respite care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These measures have also been supplemented by our commitment to provide a tax rebate for older Australians who have private health insurance. Many senators would recognise that, at the time of their life when they may have more call on the health system, many older people see private health insurance as a major priority. During the last 13 years of the Labor government, private health insurance became progressively more and more expensive for older people. During the short period when I was the shadow minister for the aged, people would constantly come to me and say that they wanted to maintain their private health insurance and they were facing a crisis as to affordability. They were having to choose between fixing the spouting or maintaining their private health insurance. For some people, it was even more basic necessities that were being called into question for the sacrifice of private health insurance.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6845">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It means a lot to older people to have that security of knowing that, if the need arises, they will get the care they want and need. But the Labor Party is so out of touch with older people in our community they simply cannot accept the validity and the merit of our incentives in the health insurance area for all Australians, which includes older people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my own portfolio, the government has kept the critical commitments to older Australians. We committed ourselves to underpinning one of the most important aspects for the financial security of older Australians. By that I mean committing ourselves to keeping the pension at 25 per cent of average male weekly earnings. Not only did we make that commitment; we put the provision in the forward estimates. That gives the security of knowing that that money will be there if and when it is needed. Surely, security of income has to be one of the most important ways that you can protect older people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are the first government to ever make that commitment. It is almost unbelievable, but we are the first government to provide that security by taking the step to have the future cost factored into the forward estimates. I think it is something this government can be proud of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government had 13 years to do that and could not be bothered. It could not find the time to make a decision that would provide some certainty for those older Australians whom they now would cry crocodile tears over and suggest that they care so much about. It just was not a budget priority for the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to that commitment in the forward estimates as to the pension as a proportion of total average male weekly earnings, we have also maintained the commitment to the regular six&hyphen;monthly indexation of pensions. I well remember when we came into government that there were cries of gloom and doom from the Labor Party and their friends, suggesting we would be junking those commitments and that pensioners would be the sufferers. The proof is in the pudding. Our commitments were in the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I draw the Senate's attention not only to our 30&hyphen;page policy for older Australians prior to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the election, but also to the fact that in our first budget we produced a 25&hyphen;page document, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meeting our commitments</EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">&mdash;recognising older Australians</EMPHASIS>. We are putting our policy substantially into place, and more will come in succeeding budgets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has also maintained its commitment to keeping the income and assets changes to a minimum for age pensioners. We believe that by simplifying the extended deeming rules to remove the confusing deeming exempt limits of $2,000 and $4,000 for single and married pensioners respectively, we will be helping in that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been advised by my department that over 30 financial institutions already offer interest at the current deeming rates on amounts under $2,000. This new measure will have the effect of increasing overall pensioner income for those pensioners who choose to earn the deeming rate on their small account balances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have announced we will be improving the fairness and equity of treatment of investments for those aged over 55 but not yet at age pension age, because by including superannuation assets in the means test for the over 55s who have been receiving government support for a period of nine months, we are removing the preferential treatment reserved for one financial investment over another, and that is for one Australian over another.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not going to force older Australians to spend, waste away or otherwise divest themselves of their superannuation before being eligible for government assistance, as is claimed by the Labor Party and some other opponents of the measure. The Labor Party and others have caused a great deal of confusion in the community over this measure by continually suggesting people will have to spend all their superannuation. It simply is not true. Older Australians with smaller or more modest amounts of super will continue to be protected by the income free area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With my announcement on the reduction of the deeming rates this afternoon, a single pensioner whose only other source of income is from financial investments will be able to have up to $52,500 in financial investments and a pensioner couple can have up to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6846"> $91,200 before they are affected by this measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party obviously does not understand it. Yet the honourable member for Jagajaga, Ms Jenny Macklin, said in August that the average amount held in superannuation is $38,000. Therefore, most people will not be affected. But for those with larger amounts of superannuation, they will generally be able to replace any reduction in their government benefit from the interest that their fund earns. Where individuals are unable to access this superannuation, exemptions from extended deeming under the incomes test may be requested and, for those affected by the assets test, other measures are available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a very simple question: why should someone with $250,000 in superannuation be able to receive a government benefit when someone who has not had access to superannuation and has invested their savings elsewhere cannot get assistance? Our measure simply treats all investments equally, and all older Australians equally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to these measures, the government, in accordance with its election promise, has maintained its commitment to providing a tax rebate for low income older Australians. As a transitional measure, the rebate will be phased in during 1996&hyphen;97 at half the pensioner rebate and will be available at the full rebate level for the 1997&hyphen;98 income year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, the government will allow older Australians to continue contributing to superannuation up to the age of 70 if they so wish. This measure, and the retirement savings accounts&mdash;which will be very important to women&mdash;will help all those who have had poor access to superannuation. I say that it will be particularly beneficial to older women because so many of them have had broken periods in the work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clear that the Labor Party does not have credibility with older people. It was deserted by older people at the election, and who could be surprised when, as we saw, it was something like only 200 words that the former Labor government used to demonstrate any interest at all in older Australians. After 13 years in government&mdash;and inaction on a number of fronts, as I have highlighted&mdash;it <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> was quite clear to those who went to the polls on 2 March that Labor was not even trying for older people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet Labor Party members have the gall to come in here and portray themselves as representing the interests of the elderly. What is the reality? This new, vital, energetic, active government has delivered already for older people in a range of areas, such as social security, carers, aged care, private health insurance, tax rebates, and I could go on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have opposite a true opposition, opposing every measure that can benefit older Australians, including areas such as aged care where they knew there was a problem. They were told of the scope and the scale of the problem through the reports that they commissioned, yet they did not act. I do not think there can be any clearer indictment of the former Labor government, and that is what was recognised by older Australians on 2 March.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(6.17 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Australian Democrats, I rise to speak to Senator Faulkner's motion. I draw the attention of the Senate to the three phrases in the motion, which I want to underline this afternoon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first phrase is `the Senate condemns the Government'; the second phrase is `for abandoning older Australians'; and the third phrase is `to the mercy of market forces'. This afternoon I want to try some definitions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a new religion here in Canberra called `market fundamentalism'. It is a religion that needs definition because it is sweeping this country. It is a religion that I do not regard favourably at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The word `market' is about shifting figures around on a balance sheet; numbers are elevated and people are discounted. `Fundamentalism' is a world view. There are many forms of it. You can have Christian fundamentalism, Muslim fundamentalism, economic fundamentalism, Marxist fundamentalism. But in each case the world view is similar, although there may be a few different words in the definition.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6847">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part of that world view is the idea that everyone who does not belong is the enemy and that only believers have value&mdash;except that in market fundamentalism, even believers are discounted. It only values those to whom it can assign a dollar value. I think that is a fair definition and I would like to examine whether this government is comprised of market fundamentalists, and whether the motion we have before us fits that definition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me first of all talk about Labor in government because, in government, Labor were half&hyphen;hearted believers in this particular religion. I am pleased to see that they are now agnostic, if not atheistic, in regard to the new religion. That is heartening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition are true believers in this new religion. I want to examine some of the creed of that new religion to see whether what the government has done fits with it. The first part of the creed reads, `Market fundamentalism asks for acceptance of its vision, not on the basis of economic reality but on the basis of blind faith.' It says, `We may have broken over two&hyphen;thirds of our promises but you can trust us.' That is blind faith.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When did the government say they would impose increased co&hyphen;payments for pharmaceuticals? The co&hyphen;payment contribution for pharmaceuticals will increase from 1 January 1997 and it will significantly hit older people. This means that the out&hyphen;of&hyphen;pocket costs for prescriptions for pensioners will rise from $2.70 to $3.20. That might not seem much to people like us on the income we enjoy but, certainly, to a pensioner who is already having difficulties surviving financially, such an increase might be the difference between making ends meet and not making ends meet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government says, `They will be able to manage. It will be okay.' Let us not forget that pensioners, at their time of life, are more likely to need a greater number of prescriptions than most other people. The government wants blind faith: `You can trust us. Even if we did not tell you we were going to do this or if we told you something else, that is okay. It was not really one of our core promises.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Did the government indicate before the election that it was going to abolish the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Commonwealth dental health program at the end of 1996? I did not read it. Perhaps I missed it; perhaps it was an addendum. The dental health program has been very important for age pensioners and many other people on low incomes. The prohibitive cost of private preventive dental care in this country makes it impossible for those people to have that kind of dental health without the help this program had provided. For the majority of older people, who are trying to survive on the age pension, accessing privately provided dental care is simply not an option. This government should be ashamed of itself for this swipe at those who are financially disadvantaged in our society. For many of these people there simply are not any alternatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the second aspect of the creed of market fundamentalists. It says disagreeing with the creed of market fundamentalism is not simply a disagreement about an alternative way; it is regarded as heresy. And you know what they did to heretics! There is in Canberra a new inquisition&mdash;slow lingering death by strangulation for people who do not belong and who do not fit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me give you an example of this. By increasing the user&hyphen;pays component for HACC services, what we have is old people at home with few options, wondering whether or not they will be able to survive independently. If that is not torture, I do not know what is. The home and community care services are very important to many older people as they help them to remain independent and to stay in their own homes for as long as possible. HACC services, which are jointly funded by the Commonwealth and the states and territories, provide older people with things like meals and in&hyphen;home nursing care. Increasing the user&hyphen;pays component for HACC services basically means that this government is choosing to make it much harder for pensioners to stay in their own home once they begin to become frail or unwell.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me give you the third element in the market fundamentalism creed. This creed believes in the new world order from which all notions of community are eliminated and society is just a collection of competing <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6848"> individuals. Remember it was Margaret Thatcher who said there is no such thing as society. There are competing individuals. And certainly in this new world order those who have money will win and those who have very little will lose significantly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I give you the example of the entry contributions for nursing homes. I can tell you there is an incredible amount of fear amongst older people about the impact the introduction of entry contributions for nursing homes would have on them and their families. We do appreciate that many nursing homes are in critical need of an injection of funding for capital infrastructure. We will not stand by and see this happen at the expense of nursing home residents and those who are old and vulnerable within the community. They are not competing individuals; they are people who have learned to cooperate and who would like a little bit of cooperation at the end of their lives. The Democrats will work hard to ensure that any legislation which passes through the Senate is accompanied by very strong safeguards to ensure that the interests of older people are protected in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth element in this creed reads like this: market fundamentalism refuses to consider any restraint because such restraints delay the coming of the kingdom&mdash;even if it means broken promises. Let me give you one of the broken promises which is probably one of the most scandalous. The election manifesto of the coalition read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition is fully committed to engendering stability, security, simplicity and flexibility into the superannuation system. <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">This commitment will enable all Australians to plan for their retirement with a greater degree of certainty.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Well, I am sorry. If this government does not realise it, what it has done and what it is doing to superannuation does not introduce simplicity, does not introduce security, stability or flexibility, but is further designed to confuse people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me point out that superannuation is not like other savings or other financial arrangements. Very deliberately, superannuation, with multiparty support, has been designed as a specific instrument that people can use and, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> until this government brought in its alterations, had been designed to give people confidence that they would have sufficient income when they retire to be able to support themselves. It seems to me that the government's agenda will allow nothing to stop its ideology. Even what was a previously multiparty approach can be discarded once this government puts in place its own ideology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the government's approach to super now is that it will destroy the confidence of people in superannuation. I can say to the government that, if there is any more destruction of public confidence, it will be impossible to maintain the superannuation system, and that is exactly what this government is doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as I am concerned, the proposition that people over 55 who are sacked will have to draw down their superannuation is an appalling one. It breaches the central principle of superannuation that savings must be preserved for retirement. No-one under 55 will be forced to cut into their super. People are saying to me that, for them, this is similar to the Menzies government raiding the pension funds in the 1950s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This religion is a most destructive one. It is one with a very clear creed and it is one that ought to be of concern to all of Australia, but especially to older people in this nation. For those reasons, the Democrats support this motion.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to Senator Faulkner's motion. I believe it is important, before launching into this debate, to first discuss what is meant by market forces in the terms of this debate. Markets, in very wide terms, means virtually everything competes with everything else for the buyers' dollars. In this case, we are talking about dollars of older members.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the perfect world, if the supplier of a service or product decides to increase the price, on the demand side members of our community can switch their patronage and seek some other source of supply. In many cases, that is difficult for older people who, as customers, have become accustomed over time to particular products or services. Older <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6849"> people, understandably, are loathe to switch to something cheaper, especially when they are wise to the fact that, on the supply side, sellers can adjust their product plans by substituting one service or product for another, resulting in most cases in providing less and charging more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be fair to say that, in some sections of the Australian aged care system, there has been in existence a quasi market. Nursing homes, which I will mention later, have for many years had a private for profit component, and hostels are now in the same category.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we know, the previous government stuck by its commitment to older Australians to ensure that they&mdash;and I refer especially to pensioners, but not solely&mdash;should be entitled to live with dignity, have a secure income and have access to appropriate support services. There is a realisation on this side of the chamber that, if pensioners in particular were left to market forces, they would be faced with crippling costs and a dilution of services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apart from limited income, in many cases pensioners are unable, because of attitudes developed over their lifetime, to simply switch their patronage. They are also less likely to complain&mdash;but complaining they are, I am happy to say.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The stress and pressure that will be placed both physically and financially on our older Australians because of the budget measures are only just being realised in our community. Many peak bodies representing the elderly are most concerned and are expressing dismay at the increases in fees and the withdrawal of services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Council for Ageing in my state of Tasmania advise that many within their membership are contacting them and expressing their despair that the state government is unlikely to provide adequate dental services, with a consequential deterioration in the oral health of their members. I have raised the issue of the withdrawal of Commonwealth dental health program before in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But how will older Tasmanians in the future be able to access dental care with the cessation of the program? One filling alone can <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cost between $50 to $100. I would not like to guess what a set of new dentures would cast. Old age pensioners, for example, cannot meet that cost as they simply do not have sufficient income to cover the costs of private dental care. So the market does not supply them with a dental service they can afford. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about the proposal to set the new maximum rate of rent assistance for single people who share accommodation? In that case, older women will be penalised and we will need to review where they live and how they will survive. They will be at the mercy of market forces in the rental market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the most fundamental areas where older Australians will be at the mercy of market forces will be in the area of charges under home and community care. As yet, we still do not know what the full implications will be from the joint venture between the Commonwealth and the states on the HACC program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very concerning for the older members of society as to who will be determining the price of these fees. Will these fees, for example, be driven by market forces? Many older Australians who are HACC clients receive multiple services and are concerned as to whether some of these services will become too costly. In Tasmania we have one of the highest provisions of home meals and home help. There is a real possibility that these services will end up being provided at a cost which will be prohibitive to some of the elderly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned earlier that nursing homes have for some years operated in a quasi market. Older Australians who need to enter into a nursing home will be faced with daily charges under changes introduced by the government. This is an important issue across Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my home state of Tasmania, the proportion of the population aged 80 years living in nursing homes is one of the highest in the country. The daily fees that will need to be paid will be in addition to the up-front fee of $26,000. It is also now clear that many older Australians will need to sell their homes. They will have to put their homes on the market at a time not necessarily of their choosing. The need to sell the home so as to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6850"> be able to enter into a nursing home may not be timely, as the market may be depressed and the best price will not be attainable. Here is another example of older Australians being at the whim and the mercy of market forces. The ability to choose the appropriate time to sell the home will be taken away from older Australians because of the pressing need to enter into a nursing home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another impost on older Australians is the measure to increase the cost per prescription for concessional users by an additional 50c. This may not seem like a large amount of money, but the increase for the approximately 242,000 aged pensioners who rely solely on the $173 a week is just another impost on the elderly.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to speak to the motion before the chair. I have to start by saying that I found Senator Faulkner's attack on me today&mdash;I do not know why I seem to have been at the end of his forked tongue twice today, but, I was, and he called me ignorant. Well, the truth hurts. It does not hurt me because it is not the truth. If there is one area in which I can claim not to be ignorant, it is the area of aged care. If anybody has taken an interest in this area in parliament and in the Senate, I think I could say that I have taken an interest and that there are, most probably, not many others with the same level of interest. I am not saying that there are not others with an interest, but I think I would share that with few around the parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was interested to see what Senator Faulkner's record was. I looked through the database and discovered that he has not previously spoken on aged care. In fact, the only time he mentioned older people when he was in government, either on the backbench or as a minister, was when he answered questions in relation to veterans' affairs in his representative role. Otherwise, he was not interested in older Australians at all. That is evident by his record. Since coming into this place, that is the first speech that he has made on older people. He has asked a couple of questions in the last few weeks on nursing homes and veterans' affairs and given notice of his motion yesterday.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">His record stands on its own. It does not need close examination because there is nothing really to examine. For Senator Faulkner to come in here and call me ignorant is worse than the pot calling the kettle black. It just demonstrates that he really knows nothing about the area; therefore, what he said about me was like water off a duck's back.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When he was speaking, Senator Faulkner continued to spread the furphy that people will be required to pay $26,000 to go into a nursing home. That is an average figure. Also, what the Labor Party continually fails to point out to people is that that total amount of money is not taken. It is an entry fee which is set. The people entering a nursing home will negotiate an entry contribution with the provider, and the government will ensure strong safeguards. Entry contributions cannot be charged to full pensioners or to existing residents. Anyone who has assets of less than $22,280 will not be charged an entry contribution. Financially disadvantaged people will not be required to make an entry contribution. Entry contributions will not apply for short stays up to six months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The provider can only take $2,600 per annum from the entry contribution. There will be no drawdown for the first six months. The maximum that can be drawn down over five years is set at $13,000. So whether you pay an $80,000 entry fee or whether you pay $26,000 entry fee, the nursing home can use the interest on that money and draw down from $2,600 to a maximum of $13,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The money&mdash;the capital&mdash;that is in there will be protected by prudential arrangements. If the resident leaves the nursing home, the residual in the account will be refunded to the resident or the resident's estate. That is a very different picture from the glib $26,000 everyone will have to pay to go into a nursing home. What those opposite do is just present a very glib figure and scare older people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Faulkner said that hostel accommodation is a choice and nursing homes are health care. I do not know when we suddenly made this distinction, but it seems to be something that the opposition have suddenly dreamt up to suit their purposes. Senator Faulkner only needs to go into hostels now <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6851"> with residents with an average age of something like 82 and see the level of dependency in those hostels. He will learn that it is not choice for most people who go into hostels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was bizarre to say the least that the Labor government had a system in place of having an ingoing&mdash;there was not all this argy&hyphen;bargy about having to sell your home and isn't it terrible because people made an ingoing&mdash;for a hostel and not for a nursing home. You had the ludicrous situation of having a hostel and a nursing home on the same campus&mdash;on the same property&mdash;run by the same organisation. The person would make an ingoing into the hostel on that same basis with controls about how much could be taken by the proprietor or by the organisation running the hostel. They moved across the corridor&mdash;literally across the corridor&mdash;to the nursing home, and the organisation had to give their money back.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not understand the logic. I do not understand why they could justify it. People used to say to me over and over and over again when I went into nursing homes and hostels, `I don't understand the logic. How can you justify an ingoing for a hostel when you move the person across the corridor to a nursing home and you give them back their ingoing?' The Labor Party, when it was in government, was quite capable of rationalising and justifying an ingoing for a hostel. But, somehow, they have some problem with an ingoing for nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Faulkner talked about nursing home standards before 1985. I have given credit where credit was due. There was a lot of reform that needed to be undertaken. I must say that the Labor Party in government undertook some of that reform. They are never prepared to give an inch on the other side. One of the reasons I became very interested in the issue of aged care was because I saw the standard of some of those nursing homes when I was teaching in the area at Lincoln Institute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were definitely reforms that needed to be made. I must say that, had we been in government, it would not have stood still. The world does not stand still. People in government carry on as though the opposition would never have done anything if they had been in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government. Yes, the Labor Party did do some things, but they failed to really address some of the major issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the major issues is the capital stock of nursing homes. They commissioned their own inquiry by Professor Gregory. Professor Gregory brought out a report&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gregory report stage 2</EMPHASIS>&mdash;which was a condemnation of the Labor Party's management of nursing homes. They had failed to bite the bullet and find some way to increase the capital funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that I have a vested interest, as do most of the people in this chamber&mdash;other than somebody like Senator O'Chee. Most of us sitting around here at this very moment ought to declare an interest because in 30 years time, which is about the time those of us sitting around here may be looking at being in a nursing home&mdash;and 25 per cent of us will be&mdash;we will need double the capital stock that we have now. Not only do we have to upgrade the stock we have but we also have to double the capital stock to accommodate people of the baby boom in nursing homes and hostels. Nothing was being done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Keating used to talk about the vision thing. Where was the vision? It was missing because the vision is that we will have an increasingly dependent ageing population reliant on a decreasing youth population. Not only will they have to pay for our nursing home and all the other support that we will need but they will also be paying back a debt that has been racked up. So they will have a double whammy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did Professor Gregory say about nursing homes? I will just summarise his points. He said that there was a need for substantial improvement in nursing home buildings. Because of the government's funding formula, there was a lack of incentive to maintain good quality nursing home stock. He found that 18 per cent of residents lived in rooms with five or more beds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Faulkner cannot get up and talk about the standards in 1985. There were still nursing homes that were not acceptable when Labor went out of power. There were toilets not large enough to allow elderly people with frames or wheelchairs to receive assistance, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6852"> and that was the most common structural fault.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Professor Gregory said that the present funding system was not providing sufficient funding and not attracting the applications necessary for the replacement and upgrading of nursing homes in the voluntary sector. He said that, across the voluntary sector, 670 beds a year needed to be replaced to ensure that all beds were replaced over a 40-year lifetime, and this level had not been achieved at any time in the last eight years. That report was brought down in 1994&mdash;an indictment of Labor's management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to get the capital from somewhere. We must get the capital from somewhere to actually upgrade current nursing homes to bring them up to world standard. I must say we have many nursing homes in Australia that are world standard. They ought to be a beacon on the hill to countries around the world of world class, quality aged care, but we have some others where none of us would want to put our mothers. The policy ought to be such that it develops capital funding to enable upgrading, replacement and development of new stock. We have all those jobs to do to face the future. Senator Faulkner can look back all he likes to the past but, if you just look back to the record that they have had so far, it is pretty poor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that I do not often agree with members on the other side, but I had to agree with Gary Johns, basically. In a letter that he wrote to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 19 September 1996, he got it right. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact is that the system&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the system of making ingoings&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">already applies to hostels, so why not extend it to nursing homes? Essentially, people will be asked to make a contribution out of their assets to the upkeep of the home. The amount charged will vary according to the customer's assets. The important part, though, is that the proprietor can only make money from the interest earned from the contribution, and $1300 for every six months up to five years. The unused portion of the total contribution is returned at the end of the stay.</PARA>
<PARA>I have to say that Gary Johns got it right. He was one of the few people who was prepared to actually outline the policy. He goes on to say in his letter:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are more than 400,000 people over the age of 80, and that number may well double by 2021, so the capital required to upgrade and build homes will be huge.</PARA>
<PARA>He has seen it. I do not know why Gary Johns is not there making some of the policies and addressing some of the issues. He has seen it, and he says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is entirely fair that those who use those facilities should make a contribution.</PARA>
<PARA>Earlier on in his letter he said he could not understand how you could have a policy where Kerry Packer pays the same as Mrs Smith. That is the system we have now. That is the system that Labor has left us with. Any one of us on a parliamentary pension would pay the same as a person on the pension. That is not fair. Some of us will be required to make a greater contribution to the capital upkeep and the capital replacement of nursing home facilities. He says in his letter:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The taxpayer has already paid for the enormous amount of care and attention that the elderly receive. They pay through Medicare, the public hospitals, home and community care, Meals on Wheels, carer pensions, and so on.</PARA>
<PARA>Yes, he is right, and so we ought to, but there is a limit. We do not have a bottomless pit. We have to find some other ways of ensuring that we get a first&hyphen;class system that is fair and equitable and find a way of funding the capital for both upgrading, replacement and new capital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Until the Labor Party can come up with a better solution than what we have suggested&mdash;and they did not do it in the 13 years they were in government&mdash;they ought to be quiet and listen to Gary Johns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know how they had the gall to come in here and move the motion they have today. In September last year I moved a motion in this place. I will point out the record they have had. I moved:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where were the incentives for people of all ages but particularly those over 65 to maintain their participation in private health insurance? They bleat over there saying it will all get evened up in increases. If Labor had been in power, they would have had to pay the increases with no rebate, with no assistance. So do not sit there saying that it has been taken up by increases. People would have been left to pay the increase with no assistance at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The motion also went on to condemn them for inflexibility of recurrent funding and the crisis in capital funding of nursing homes and hostels, which I have mentioned. What else? It also went on to condemn the failure of the Labor government to adequately fund dementia&hyphen;specific facilities and to provide appropriate and affordable respite care for people with dementia and their carers. Senator Newman has outlined what we are doing for carers and the fact that we are prepared to have dementia&hyphen;specific facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The home and community care program was so disjointed that people were falling between the cracks. We are looking to have a review of that. Also, the Labor government failed to really address superannuation, particularly giving women who move in and out of the work force greater flexibility through retirement savings accounts. Their record on older people is absolutely abysmal.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for the l&hyphen;a&hyphen;w tax cuts that they promised older people, they did not get those either. They were actually going to keep that promise through a legislative process. So the record of those on the other side with regard to older people stands condemned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1999 we will have the United Nations International Year of Older Persons.

This is a government which continues to praise itself for having the courage to take the hard decisions. But this is also the government which coined the term `non&hyphen;core election promise'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since then it has become apparent that the chief distinction between `core' and `non&hyphen;core' commitments is who they were made to. Pastoralists, miners and media magnates are among those to which the Howard government has managed to keep its word. Other minority groups, however, have had a very different experience of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Welfare recipients, those with physical and mental disabilities, the homeless, the jobless&mdash;all have found the word of the Howard government to be worthless. Even more disturbing, some groups have been singled out by this government for special attention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These victims I refer to as the three A's&mdash;Aborigines, Asians and the Aged. These are the people upon whom the greatest burden has fallen since the March election. But while indigenous issues and immigration have attracted heated debate, the plight of the elderly has gone largely unnoticed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps no other group in this country has been so badly betrayed by this government as the frail and aged. For many of our older people, the first nine months of the Howard government have meant increasing confusion, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6854"> insecurity and fear. This fear has not been created by the opposition or minor parties.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been created by the policies of the Howard government, policies which would see the role of government in providing security for the aged replaced by the uncaring interaction of supply and demand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consider the Howard government's plan to replace public housing by subsidising the private rental market. There can be few clearer examples of this government abandoning older Australians to the mercy of market forces. In Australia, the need to provide public housing has been recognised by successive federal and state governments since 1945. The first Commonwealth&hyphen;state housing agreement was developed by the Chifley Labor government in November that year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ever since, the Commonwealth has invested directly in public housing on a dollar&hyphen;for&hyphen;dollar basis with the states. Fifty years later, the Howard government says it has a better idea. It plans to take the $1 billion of taxpayers' money allocated for public housing and simply hand it to private landlords. The results of this move are likely to be disastrous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Already, this government has reduced the current Commonwealth&hyphen;state housing agreement from three years to one, ruling out any long&hyphen;term capital investment in new public housing by the states. As a consequence, the states will cease building public housing and rely on the private market to make up the shortfall.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In contrast, Labor remains committed to: the maintenance of overall levels of public housing stock; an increase in public housing in well&hyphen;located areas, especially in the inner parts of cities and those close to jobs and services; the redevelopment of old housing estates; and a guarantee that no public housing tenant pays more than 25 per cent of their income in rent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government says its policy is more equitable for those in the private rental market receiving rent assistance. Every age pensioner in public housing has at one time or another been in the private market. Many of them exhausted their life savings paying rent, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> waiting up to three years for accommodation to become available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The irony of this policy is that those struggling in the private market are probably on waiting lists for public housing that will now not be built. Rental assistance was never intended as a substitute for public housing. Where public housing has been replaced with rental assistance overseas, it has failed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In October, Auckland University's Dr Larry Murphy warned the government that the introduction of this policy in New Zealand had led to the formation of ghettos. He said that the scheme had forced people to spend more than half their incomes on housing. Landlords had simply increased rents because they knew people had access to the subsidy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not surprisingly, government spending on housing has tripled since the scheme was introduced. By continuing with its policy, the government is demonstrating it is not listening to the legitimate concerns of those who will be most affected&mdash;the elderly. Nor is it listening to the arguments against its plans to introduce up&hyphen;front entry fees for nursing homes. It would seem that the Howard government is the only group that cannot distinguish between nursing homes and hostels. Nursing homes are not retirement villages or hostels. Nursing homes have patients, not residents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For many older Australians, nursing homes represent their only chance of receiving the care and attention they not only require but deserve. But this government says to them, `If you want to receive that care, then you can expect to have to pay an average of $26,000 up front.'</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My remarks lead on from the speech you were making, Madam Acting Deputy President, about the elderly and the need for hostels and for nursing care. That issue leads into this response to the report from the Legal and Constitional References Committee about national citizenship indicators and benchmarks because that is what this is aimed at. Senator Parer talks in the Senate about the fall or the rise in interest rates and the balance of payments&mdash;and these economic indicators are very important&mdash;but we tend to overlook those other issues that are more important, I think, in terms of the sort of society we want.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Madam Acting Deputy President, you no doubt want money to see that the elderly are well looked after&mdash;we know your work in this field&mdash;and you have said that we need money for that. But it is not the money that is the important thing; the important thing is what is done with the money, what ends up happening as a result of us all paying taxes to the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report and the reasonably sympathetic response from the government are about ways of measuring that quality of life that we want: how many people are able to live in reasonable comfort, how many of our people are being properly educated, what sort of cultural activities we engage in&mdash;how many national galleries we have, where we can enjoy great works of art, how many sporting fields we have&mdash;and how we get on as a community. If we can see a consistent measurement of those things in the same way as we see a consistent measurement of the economic matters that affect our lives, if we can see those sorts of indicators in terms of the things that are really important in our existence, then we are making a big advance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, there will come a time for all of us when we are on our deathbed, looking <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> back on our careers&mdash;here and elsewhere. Will we at that stage be saying, `Yes, I got an extra tonne of coal out of the mine' or `I opened a hotel at Currie on King Island, which one of my fellow senators perhaps should have opened'? Are we going to do that, or are we instead going to say, `What have we done'&mdash;to use the old phrase&mdash;`for our fellow man and our fellow woman?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">National wellbeing: A system of national citizenship indicators and benchmarks</EMPHASIS> is about those great issues of life. The report had its genesis in the mind of many people but it was brought into the Senate by Senator Sid Spindler, as he then was. It was a report that commenced under my chairmanship&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Senator West. I will have to get that on the record. And the report was completed under the chairmanship of Chris Ellison.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a lot of problems with the concept because the issue of what is the proper measurement of a particular factor&mdash;such as how to measure the sort of social security we have in the community&mdash;can be a matter of opinion, a matter that leads to political tension because, as is clearly illustrated in a chamber such as this, different people take different views as to how our human needs are responded to by government&mdash;and not only by government but by other agencies, such as hospitals, schools, churches, trade unions and associations of employers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In any event, the important thing is that we should get down to determining some sort of measure that we can all agree upon in spite of our different beliefs, our different political outlooks, our different social concerns. If we can get this system of indicators, then we can argue in this chamber on a more sensible basis. The community can look to itself, can look to the way it is going, in a much better way than it does now. There is no reason why that should not be done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6856"> The committee made some recommendations and the government has responded. It is good to see in the response that the govern ment accepts&mdash;this is set down in the response:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the on&hyphen;going need for the Australian Bureau of Statistics to audit national statistical collection activities with reference to other agencies such as the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare and the Australian Institute of Criminology. This will ensure the availability of statistics on human wellbeing to support the government and community in the development and evaluation of policies and programs.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very encouraging response. It would be a good thing if all of us, no matter what party we are from, could ensure that the government keeps up with that very positive response.</PARA>
<PARA>The second recommendation is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the Australian Bureau of Statistics be resourced to collect relevant data and develop indicators in the area of social and political participation.</PARA>
<PARA>It should be not only in the area of social and political participation but also in terms of the cultural life of a country and every other aspect of life, even the sporting life of a country, because it is these things that make up the sort of society we enjoy. The government response is this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has asked the Australian Bureau of Statistics to establish, in consultation with other relevant agencies, the level and nature of the unmet demand for information in the area of social and political participation and to assess its priority in the context of the overall ABS work program.</PARA>
<PARA>It is not simply a matter of collecting information, although that is an essential first step; it is a matter of putting that information in such a state that we can draw conclusions from it that we as a society can act upon. Having acted upon it, the community we live in becomes a much better place. Recommendation 3 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Australian Government give high priority to the establishment of a National System of Indicators and Benchmarks capable of measuring performances in the area of legal, economic, social and cultural significance.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a good thing. Then it goes on to other matters. I will read recommendation 5 and the government response. Recommendation 5 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the Government provide appropriate support to establish links with <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the relevant activities, notably the proposed United Nations Research Institute for Social Development Conference on Globalization and Citizenship to be held in Australia this year and the various civics and education programs.</PARA>
<PARA>The government response is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recommendation is supported.</PARA>
<PARA>Talking about the United Nations Research Institute for Social Development and the proposed conference, one of our very eminent members of parliament, Mr John Langmore, is to take up an important place in the United Nations.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to this report this evening because, whilst the issue might seem dead to some people, it still is very much alive. This report bears some very close study indeed. The problem with the cancellation of the DIFF scheme, as it is known, was that firstly it took no cognisance of one of the projects that was in the pipeline and the loss in monetary and employment terms to those firms in the pipeline and, secondly, the damage to relations with China, Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines.  </PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6857">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The very nature of the processing of DIFF applications made it a nonsense to cut the scheme unilaterally, as the government did. All that did was hurt small business, and it insulted our neighbours. The process of the operation of the DIFF scheme is outlined clearly at page 18 of the report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were two major hurdles that companies seeking DIFF finance had to overcome. The first was the letter of advice and the second was the formal offer. That is important in the scheme of things because it leads on to the big unanswered question which, if I do not get the time to pursue this evening, I will pursue at another time. To jump these hurdles, the projects had to be consistent with the OECD arrangements covering export credits, including the Helsinki guidelines. There is no doubt in my mind that the projects in this pipeline constituted genuine aid. That was part of the real sticking point with the government in its cancellation of this scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At page 45 of the report, a table shows clearly that the number of projects that had reached the stage of formal offer of letters of advice was indeed substantial. The grand total was 57 projects worth $1.284 billion to those companies that were in either the stage of formal offer or the stage of letter of advice. While some of the projects that were at the stage of letter of advice would not have reached the formal offer stage, the vast majority would have. This is the evidence that was presented to the committee. To reach that stage, these companies would have been spending hundreds of thousands of dollars, as instanced on pages 48 to 50; that is, they outlaid money to get themselves to the stage of formal offer. A cursory glance at pages 48 to 50 shows companies spending in the order of $120,000, $200,000 and $700,000. These are not insignificant amounts for small businesses, in particular, which were affected by the government's unilateral decision. It was chicanery once again on the part of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This outlay, though, was done in good faith by many of these companies and it was done cold. There was no consolation whatsoever for the Australian businesses seeking to make breakthroughs in very competitive markets <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> only to see valuable capital laid to waste. For example, LABAX International Pty Ltd and the University of Queensland stood to lose $1.2 million alone through the cancellation of DIFF.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the first instance, the DIFF scheme may have supported aid projects, but there was invariably follow-up business which did not attract DIFF funding. The follow-up business was estimated to be in the order of at least five to one. The committee heard varying reports about the contribution of follow-up business, which has now been denied to small business.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Follow-up business had been really good for the long-term future of our industries, for employment and the sustainability of small businesses in particular. The DIFF scheme undoubtedly provided access to markets through concessional finance, which is provided by many of our trading partners and competitors throughout the world. As part of that matrix of competition, one sees that we deserted the matrix and left it to the others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt, though, that there is a place for such a scheme, as the majority report findings state at pages 95 and 96. It is important to reiterate it for the sake of the Senate. At page 95, the committee report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the Australian Government not wait for the financial year 1997-98 but introduce, at the earliest possible time, another mixed credits scheme to replace the Development Import Finance Facility.</PARA>
<PARA>Further, the report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the replacement mixed credits scheme be based on the following criteria:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> that it be primarily a development aid scheme;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> that emphasis be given to projects of an humanitarian, poverty alleviation or environmental nature;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> that all projects be open to competition among Australian companies.</PARA>
<PARA>Whilst that is there, we still hear silence from this government, which is damning indeed.</PARA>

<STATE> (Tasmania)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(7.20 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening, I wish to address some remarks on the report tabled earlier this day by the Senate Select Committee on the Victorian Casino Inquiry. May I commence my remarks by congratulating the deputy chair of the committee, Senator Troeth, on her professionalism and the erudite report she produced on behalf of government senators. On behalf of not only myself but also government members of the committee, I also wish to place on record my thanks to Frank Nugent, the committee secretary, and his secretariat for their dedication and work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This select committee was born out of the personal animosity to the Victorian Premier held by those opposite. This animosity is based on his huge electoral success and the fact that he has so comprehensively routed the Labor Party in his state of Victoria. It was such a comprehensive rout that Labor in Victoria is now engaged in a most bitter and divisive factional battle over the spoils of defeat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The terms of reference for the committee were basically fourfold. In brief, they were the following: firstly, to look at the adequacy of Commonwealth legislation in relation to casinos; secondly, the adequacy of the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988; thirdly, whether the granting of any licence to any casino within Australia has affected Australia's overseas reputation; and, fourthly&mdash;the sting in the tail as far as Labor was concerned&mdash;to inquire into the Victorian casino. There was nothing stopping the committee from inquiring into the first three terms of reference if those opposite were genuine about inquiring into the casino industry generally in order to clean it up. However, we all know that they only put those three terms of reference in before the Victorian casino reference to try to give the inquiry some facade of respectability.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6859">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once it became apparent that they could not lay a glove on the Victorian government, they deserted the whole inquiry and no longer wanted to pursue it. There was nothing stopping the committee from looking at the Financial Transaction Reports Act. There was nothing stopping us from looking at the adequacy of Commonwealth legislation. But once their chief political target had evaded them, they were no longer interested in those other terms of reference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Listening to Senator Childs and Senator Ray this morning I was reminded of one of those options you can now get on new cars&mdash;dual air bags. With all the wind and allegations and hot air that they produced this morning, they did not provide us with any substance. If Senator Childs wants to talk about grubby deals, let him explain to the Senate why a democratically elected senator such as he has to resign to make way for a left wing trade union hack like George Campbell. Do not lecture this side on grubby deals, Senator Childs; it ill behoves you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Ray promised us that he would raise allegations under parliamentary privilege next week. Senator Woodley did likewise. For the record, let it be quite clear that neither senator raised the information that they allegedly had with a committee&mdash;information which, of course, would have attracted parliamentary privilege. Let me say to that Senator Ray and Senator Woodley: if you have the evidence, instead of waiting until next week, take those 10 steps to courage and repeat it right now outside this chamber. Of course, they will not do that. There is no need to wait&mdash;they can do it right now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They both raised their voices during the discussions today and spoke with a great degree of pretend passion, but the volume of the noise did not overcome the fact that they failed tactically and practically. Those opposite need to realise that mere repetition does not overcome the void occasioned by the absence of merit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Woodley's announcement on 1 October really showed us what it was all about. During our considerations he told a journalist working with the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have a whole raft of documentary evidence and if they&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the Victorian government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">do not allow the public servants to appear, we will simply present that which would not be in the Victorian government's interests at all.</PARA>
<PARA>So did we expect an unjaundiced, fair, open&hyphen;minded approach to this inquiry? Of course not. It was quite clear that Senator Woodley and those opposite had already made up their minds. I simply say to Senator Woodley: where is this whole raft of evidence that he said to the community at large the committee held? We got 10 submissions, most of which were irrelevant. Some were relevant, but did not touch on the specific matter of any wrongdoing in relation to the Victorian casino inquiry. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The evidentiary part aside, Senator Woodley and Labor Party senators lived up to their promise to `simply present that which would not be in the Victorian government's interests at all.' An approach like that to a Senate committee report would make the Spanish Inquisition blush. At least the Communist show trials of past decades had a facade of procedural fairness about them; they had the facade of doing things right. But Senator Woodley really let the cat out of the bag by saying, `We will simply present that which would not be in the government's best interests at all.' I have to say to them that they did deliver on their promise by recommending a royal commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In contrast, the government senators took a very principled stand and agreed with the Labor senators on some fundamental principles and guidelines that Senate inquiries or committees ought to follow in the future. They are: firstly, that current and former members of state parliament should not be summoned or required to answer questions on matters which relate to their activities as members of parliament or ministers. Secondly, current and former senior public servants, ministerial advisers and members of statutory bodies should not be summoned or required to answer questions on matters which relate to their activities as advisers to state ministers or cabinet on policy issues. Thirdly, the production of documents which were prepared for the purpose of informing, advising or decision making by state ministers or state <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6860"> cabinets should not be demanded. We joined with the Labor Party on that, and I congratulate them for coming to that conclusion. But, unfortunately, the temptation to take a swipe at the Victorian government on the way through was a little bit too great. Senator Woodley, in an amazing little number in his dissenting report, tells us this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What has happened here today is that the Premier of Victoria has manipulated a Senate inquiry with the express purpose of avoiding scrutiny of a highly controversial government decision.</PARA>

So what you are saying, Senator Conroy, is that your big chief and leader, Senator Ray, was manipulated by the Premier of Victoria, Mr Kennett; that Senator Collins was manipulated; and that Senator Childs was manipulated. That is hardly something that stands up to any analysis. It really does go beyond the limits of credulity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor senators at least had the decency to realise the ill&hyphen;considered nature of this inquiry. The reality is that the Labor senators got a bit excited about the potential of this inquiry and let the blood rush to their head. But, unfortunately, in rushing to their head, the blood bypassed their brain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> But they did finally agree that they could not pursue this inquiry. And no wonder! Who was the instigator of this inquiry? Senator Kim Carr, the great tactician of the Labor Party. It is no wonder the Labor Party said, `Senator Carr, you've got it started, but we are not going to allow you to serve on the committee.' I agree with the Labor Party's stance on that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that we as a Senate should view very seriously the rights of state governments and parliaments to conduct their business without the sort of intervention that was proposed in this inquiry. I congratulate the Labor Party senators on their principled stand, but I do take objection to the cheap political swipe that they took at the Victorian government on the way to coming to a very principled resolution to this matter. I am pleased to see the end of this inquiry. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this evening to address the issue of telecommunications. Despite all of the action that has taken place over the last few months and the inquiry that I participated in which explored the partial privatisation of Telstra as part of its terms of reference, it is interesting to note that the issue of telecommunications has had very little time spent on it in the chamber this evening. It is telecommunications that I wish to speak about. When we talk about the future of the Australian telecommunications industry, we are talking about an industry that probably has the greatest potential to carry us as a nation through into the next millennium.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telecommunications is an industry that is going through a major revolution and evolution. It is an industry in which we have proven we can really ride the crest of the wave of that change and be at the forefront of technological development. For a government to have such a void in their policy in the area of telecommunications is something that we will suffer well into the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This lack of vision has been exposed today by the very fact that, upon the issue of the privatisation being brought before the chamber, where our telecommunications industry is going did not even rate a mention. What we have heard about is the environment, the various deals and all the rest of it. But that is not what I want to speak about tonight. I would like to talk about telecommunications and how important I believe it is to where we are going with this industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Telecommunications has great potential. Whilst we struggle with the current debate&mdash;I believe this was brought out in the committee inquiry into the privatisation of Telstra&mdash;we are talking about telecommunications, which is a very complex industry with so many facets that it is worthy of great attention. In the lead-up to the consideration of what happens with full and open competition post&hyphen;1997, I believe those issues need to be confronted specifically and in great detail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> This government has put before the nation its plan for the transition to full competition in telecommunications. That is the issue that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6861"> we need to focus our attention on. The fact that its attention has been diverted to other issues&mdash;that is, ownership&mdash;just means that this government has left itself exposed to doing a great disservice to the whole telecommunications sector. Why is this government so myopic in the area of telecommunications? Why has it chosen to see public ownership of its major telecommunications carrier not as an opportunity&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The telecommunications industry has such huge potential&mdash;whether it be with respect to the Internet, electronic commerce or basic access and equity to the services that it provides. Therefore, telecommunications is fundamentally important as a policy tool for governments. I spoke in my first speech to this place about information and access to information being a determinant of power in our community. That is why the ability for governments to have telecommuni <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> cations as a mechanism with which to introduce social policy&mdash;be it in relation to access and equity to those technologies&mdash;is a fundamental tenet of what I believe constitutes good and reasonable government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Australia is so uniquely placed to take us forward into the next century and lead the way that I am fearful that the recent directions taken will take us in a different direction.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> For example, in the recent US election campaign, we saw President Clinton make a major announcement as part of that campaign&mdash;an initiative concerning the role of the Internet in classrooms, the role of the Internet in people's homes, and the strategy that he was going to put in place via a legislative mechanism similar to our universal service obligation to take those services to the people. We then heard the President in the House of Representatives chamber in this place restate his commitment to the developing IT sector&mdash;the industry that he saw would be one of the primary growth sectors of our whole region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I put it to the Senate that, in the context of the current debate surrounding telecommunications, with all the political intrigue, with all the side issues and all the motivations that have brought us to this point, we should remember that we are talking about the communications system in this country. We are talking about the telecommunications industry and its future. I believe that industry has much more to offer this place and much more to offer Australia than a short&hyphen;term financial return. As a government, the coalition has a responsibility for delivering those outcomes to the Australian people.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<TITLE>University of New South Wales: Closure of St George Campus</TITLE>
<SPEECH PAGE="6861" TIME="7.39 p.m." SPEAKER="Tierney, Sen John" NAMEID="O15" ELECTORATE="NSW" PARTY="LP" GOV="1">

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="O15">Senator TIERNEY</NAME>
<STATE> (New South Wales)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(7.39 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to place on record my strongest condemnation of the decision by the University of New South Wales to close the St George campus at Oatley in southern Sydney. This is a wilfully destructive decision that strikes in particular at primary teacher education, as well as other courses in southern Sydney. It is shameful that the University of New South Wales has abandoned in particular a respected and quality teacher education program. It has removed the capacity to train <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6862"> 600 primary school teachers. In coming years we will be facing a shortage in this field.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Vice&hyphen;Chancellor of the University of New South Wales, Professor John Niland, announced that the St George campus will be closed to save the university $20 million. This cut by the University of New South Wales is their contribution to the $680 million in federal government budget cuts for higher education over the coming three years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not walk away from the need for the University of New South Wales to save money. They, like all the other 37 universities, must make a contribution to budget savings. But universities are required to approach this task with care and responsibility in finding new income and in making cost savings and efficiencies in all departments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The University of New South Wales has taken a slash and burn approach. It is the laziest approach of all. They have opted for a sole vertical cut of $20 million. They have amputated two schools and a whole campus and abandoned teacher education. The use of these student places is now to be transferred to other parts of the University of New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This university has taken the opportunity to rid itself of the final amalgamation effects of 1989. The Senate will recall that this was the work of John Dawkins and that Labor's policy forced amalgamations on this sector. The effects of that amalgamation are still haunting the sector today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The institution that now faces abolition was originally the Alexander Mackie Teachers College, which became the St George Institute and, under forced amalgamation, the St George campus of the University of New South Wales, even though their original preference was for amalgamation with the University of Wollongong. They must now rue the day that they did not take that other option, because joining with New South Wales has in effect led to their demise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has destroyed a part of our education system that has a reputation for excellence. The St George campus has a name for quality in teacher education. Its students command a very high tertiary entrance rank and it attracts <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> students of high quality. Its graduates are sought after. All of this is now to be lost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to the students whose teacher training is being disrupted, other losers from this decision are, firstly, the teaching profession, because it has lost a college with a very fine reputation, one of the three most preferred institutions by New South Wales primary student teachers. That is to be abandoned at a time when Australia's present surplus of teachers is about to become a very serious shortage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To take 600 places out of teacher education at this point of the demand cycle for teachers is utterly senseless. A looming significant shortage has been identified in the training of teachers in the years ahead, particularly by an independent researcher, Barbara Preston, who has done a study on the supply of teachers in Australia. She has calculated that the current national surplus of teachers is 2,600, but that is expected to turn quickly to a shortfall of 4,700 by the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You do not produce teachers instantly, overnight. They usually require up to about four years training. So the training for that shortage in the year 2000 should be beginning right now. They are predicting that the shortage in 2000 will, by 2003, blow out to a shortage of 7,000, yet they are closing a whole campus. With evidence of this major teacher shortage crisis on the horizon, the decision by the University of New South Wales has invited inevitable and justified public condemnation, and I echo that condemnation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the people of southern Sydney are the other major losers in this. This callous decision by the University of New South Wales has taken away the only higher education preference in southern Sydney. When this goes, there will be nothing between Kensington and Wollongong. There will be no higher education offered in the federal electorates of Cook, Barton, Hughes and Watson, an area which, with its other drawing areas, has a population of a million people. That is comparable in size to Perth and also to Adelaide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned earlier that the University of Wollongong had expressed interest at the original amalgamations in having the St <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6863"> George campus as part of their university. The only glimmer of hope on the horizon is if the University of Wollongong does that. That would be an excellent outcome because the University of Wollongong is a first&hyphen;class university. In the original quality assurance rounds it ended up in the same band as the University of Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That amazed us all at the time but I spent a full day at the University of Wollongong and I found that, of all the universities I have visited, it was one of the most impressive in its programs, its research and vision. So, hopefully, the University of Wollongong could take over the rather large gap left by the University of New South Wales and, in effect, become a university for southern Sydney, servicing areas in higher education from Wollongong to Rockdale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is sad that it has come to the abandonment of a fine institution like the St George institute, one with a fine reputation and an excellent tradition, all because of the very lazy management practice of the University of New South Wales&mdash;the very same university that was happy to take over the St George campus and its 900 EFTSUs in 1990, only now to abandon the campus, its staff and students and swipe the 900 student places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That action in earlier centuries would have been called piracy. You capture the ship, St George campus, which they did in 1990; you make the crew and the passengers, that is the staff and the students, walk the plank; and you make off with the loot, which is the 900 EFTSU places. The actions of the council of the University of New South Wales at St George in this matter are morally reprehensible and socially irresponsible, and to quote Professor Alan Watson from the St George campus:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While universities rightly claim freedom from government interference, they have a responsibility to the community to provide personal and fundamental services, such as teacher education.</PARA>
<PARA>The University of New South Wales council is failing southern Sydney and teacher education by this decision. They stand condemned.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I might say before I begin how glad I was to hear Senator Tierney make remarks about the teacher shortage. That is something I had intended to raise myself. However, he seems to make no connection between that and the cuts that his government has imposed on universities, but blames it on the Dawkins reforms, which is interesting. I would like to remind him that he is in government now and is in a position to influence for change.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the reason I rise tonight is to speak on the matter of telecommunications and the national code. I spent some time today examining the responses of the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) to various of my questions recently in relation to the exemptions telecommunications carriers enjoy from local and state planning regulations. There are a number of issues here which require elaboration and even correction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, there is the question of whether it would be reasonable, in the light of widespread concern in the community and in local government, for the government to remove those exemptions right now. It suits the minister's purposes to say that councils would veto a telecommunications system of national importance and that they cannot be trusted. It also suits him to suggest that, in his words, `Senator Allison has the gall, or the unmitigated ignorance, to put out a release suggesting that there is no basis for claiming legal liability'. He went on to invite me to take a good look at myself, et cetera. I will not indulge in the sort of rhetoric which he uses but I do need to respond.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legal advice to which the minister refers was provided by the Parliamentary Library Law and Public Administration Group. The question I asked the library was: can the Commonwealth parliament end the telecommunications carrier's immunities from state and local government laws before 1 July 1997? We sought that advice following the minister's claim that the government had not sought legal advice, in spite of the fact that liability was so often quoted as one of the reasons the minister could not remove those <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6864"> exemptions. It is particularly interesting that the minister should say just yesterday:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You clearly are not interested in the legal implications of decisions that are taken in this area but we are, and the advice we have had is that it would not be proper for the Commonwealth to expose itself to liability in that way.</PARA>
<PARA>I hope that the minister has at least sought legal advice, and I will be asking him to table it in the Senate as soon as possible. In the meantime, the Australian Local Government Association has sought legal advice. That advice was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there is nothing in the Telecommunications Act which prevents the Minister from changing the provisions of a National Code by revoking an existing code and determining a replacement code. In fact this is the means permitted by the Telecommunications Act for changes to be made to the National Code.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subject to some specific exceptions which are identified below, we consider that neither the Parliament or the Executive Government can have any liability for the consequences of a change in the law (ie change to legislation, regulations or other instruments under legislation) to any person or corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is an axiomatic constitutional principle that, subject to the Constitution only, the Commonwealth Parliament has an unfettered and unrestricted power to make laws with respect to the peace, order and good government of the Commonwealth in relation to the matters specified in the Constitution. There is no doubt that Parliament may confer power on a Minister to determine regulatory controls as it has done by Section 117 of the Telecommunications Act, and such controls have the force of law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is our opinion that the principles applied in equal effect in respect of changes to the law (including changes to regulatory controls) which are affected by other instruments that are enacted, made or determined pursuant to legislation. There is no reason to differentiate between regulations and such other instruments.</PARA>
<PARA>So the government is not liable for the cost of changes it might make to codes or legislation as it affects telecommunications carriers any more than it is to chicken meat producers who might have their industry wiped out by the government's decision to import chicken from Asia or elsewhere. The government cannot be sued by those businesses who will suffer financially from the lowering of the research and development allowances, for instance. Disability support pensioners cannot sue the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government for the fact that it takes away one&hyphen;third of their rent assistance because they live in shared accommodation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The solicitors who prepared this advice for the ALGA suggested the government be asked a number of questions. These are the questions that I will put on notice to the minister shortly. Their summary of advice was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In our opinion, subject to the existence of any agreement or conduct by the Commonwealth Government which may give rise to an action at common law or for breach of a statutory duty or obligation, there are no restrictions on the extent to which a National Code may be changed by a replacement code.</PARA>
<PARA>If the minister has indeed had advice which is contrary to the two opinions I have already cited, it would be useful for us to hear what that is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope this advice also indicates to the government what their liability might be in the event that action is taken against the government by those feeling increasingly disadvantaged by the government's failure to protect them. Perhaps the minister should ask his advisers whether class action might be successful in the case in Mitcham in Adelaide which I will outline.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Vodafone proposes to construct a 36&hyphen;metre tower in the Mitcham community court and announced that construction will begin on or before 18 December. This tower will be just 40 metres from the Mitcham kindergarten and even closer to the local library and a facility for nursing mothers. The family which wrote to me said the tower will be 60 metres from the bedrooms of their children aged five, six and 10. They have already been to protest rallies in Mitcham this week, both of which were covered extensively by radio and television. I have to advise the Senate that this community in Adelaide is most distraught. They are distraught because their kindergarten will almost certainly close as a result of this tower.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am told that the Mitcham community court is a beautiful area of gardens and gum trees, but it will become a no&hyphen;go zone for parents. Parents know that it may not be safe to have their children for many hours and on a daily basis in such close proximity to a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6865"> mobile phone tower. They are asking: why is it that the government set aside $4.5 million to conduct research into the effects of electromagnetic radiation? Why is it that the new code will indicate that it is not safe to have kindergartens within 100 metres of a mobile phone tower after 1 July, but on 18 December it will be quite okay for their tower to be just 60 metres away? The Mitcham Council has proposed alternative sites but Vodafone refuses to negotiate. And why should they? The telecommunications act does not require them to take the slightest notice of councils or communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What do these people do as a result? Do they sell up and move? Will the government pay for the inevitable decrease in the value of their house? What assurances do they have that a house somewhere else will not be invaded by another tower or perhaps by several carriers on the one tower? These people say their frustration is intense and I can well understand that. But it is a pity that the government cannot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to return to the minister's remarks yesterday. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If you ask me why it is that we did not proclaim the earlier legal advice it is probably because you have been going around telling people like the Australian Local Government Association that you would move to disallow it.</PARA>
<PARA>I think the minister here was confusing legal advice with the code. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In other words, any attempts that we might make to actually tighten the code to provide greater protection would be the subject of a disallowance motion in this chamber. If that is not your position I would  very  much  welcome  you  saying . . .</PARA>
<PARA>It is fair to say that that is an example of very muddled thinking on the part of the minister. What he seems to be saying is that the government did not press ahead with the last draft code because he expected us to disallow it. Of course we would disallow it. It had no more protections and some would say it had even less than the code which it would have replaced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those who could decipher code mark II were in general agreement that it should indeed be disallowed. Perhaps if the minister had adopted more of the 57 recommendations <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> made by Austel, the code would have had more teeth and afforded more protection. We have yet to see the telecommunications national code mark III. If the best the minister can do is to change the colour of aerial cables to grey, and underground at intersections, we might disallow it as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did say to the ALGA that we will move amendments to this legislation to remove the exemption altogether and we will be doing this during the committee stage of the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill 1996 tomorrow. We will do that again when the post&hyphen;1997 telecommunications legislation comes up early next year. We will continue to draw the government's attention to this issue until something is done. The minister has had representation from many individuals and many organisations on this issue, not least of which from the ALGA.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) In order to enhance competition and choice in superannuation, the Government has decided to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6867"> allow banks, building societies, credit unions and life insurance companies to provide superannuation without a trust structure in the form of Retirement Savings Accounts. The supervision of RSAs will consist of:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Relevant prudential supervision for institutional soundness. For banks, building societies and credit unions, RSAs will form part of the deposit base of institutions and will be treated as such for prudential purposes by the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Australian Financial Institutions Commission. The RSA business of life insurance companies will be subject to supervision by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission (ISC), but will not require a trust structure. ISC functional supervision for compliance with retirement income and other superannuation standards. RSAs will be subject to the same retirement income standards as other superannuation products, including those applying to contributions and payment of benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)(a) and (b), see the response to (1) above.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) It will be mandatory for RSA providers to advise account holders of alternative `balanced portfolio' products offering potentially higher returns over the longer term, when their account balances reach $10,000. However, there will be no restriction on RSA balances exceeding this limit. The Government wishes to ensure that people's retirement incomes are maximised but recognises that for some people RSAs may be the appropriate choice, particularly for those close to retirement who may prefer a minimal risk savings vehicle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) The return on RSAs will reflect their `capital guaranteed' nature. It is expected that `balanced portfolio' products, including those offered by industry funds, potentially will offer higher returns over the longer term. But particularly for those with small amounts of superannuation, such as itinerant and casual workers, wishing to minimise risk, RSAs will provide additional choice in the superannuation market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) The level of fees applying to RSAs will be a commercial decision for the RSA provider, subject to the member protection rules, as is the case for other superannuation funds. The introduction of RSAs will provide additional competition in the superannuation industry, thereby putting downward pressure on fees and charges. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA></ANSWER></ANSWER.TO.QON>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)(a) refer Tables 1 and 2 attached (first column). <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) refer Tables 1 and 2 attached (second column).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) refer Note 3 to Tables 1 and 2 attached.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) refer Tables 1 and 2 attached (third and fourth columns).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) refer Tables 1 and 2 attached (fourth and fifth columns).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(f) refer Note 2 to Tables 1 and 2 attached.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(g) refer Note 3 to Tables 1 and 2 attached.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Attachment (A) relates to 1996 residue only licences listed in Table 1. Attachment (B) relates to long&hyphen;term transitional licences listed in Table 2 and includes the Minister's media release of 31 October 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) All of the licence volume for transitional residue licences for 1996 (specified in Table 1) consists of residue wood chips as defined in the Regulations. For the period 1 January 1997 to 31 December 1999, licences have been issued for 1 million tonnes of sawmill residues and silvicultural thinnings only, out of a total volume of 6.251 million tonnes. Exporters are also required to give preference to residue woodchips (see attached standard licence conditions).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) From the regions (and the sawmills in the regions) defined in the Schedule to the Export Control (Hardwood Wood Chips) (1996) Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) A number of licence applicants were asked to provide additional information in relation to the criteria for assessment specified in Regulation 7 of the Export Control (Hardwood Wood Chips) (1996) Regulations. Information is generally provided by applicants on an `in&hyphen;confidence' basis. It contains commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence information and it is therefore inappropriate for me to release it. I have no objection to Senator Brown requesting this information from the applicants. The names and addresses of all applicants are at Attachment D.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) All of the matters listed in Regulation 8 of the Export Control (Hardwood Wood Chips) (1996) Regulations, where relevant, are considered by the Minister in assessing transitional licence applications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) The regulations do not require determinations in relation to these matters, but require a Minister to take them into consideration, where relevant, in making a decision on whether to grant or refuse a licence application.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(f) A copy of standard transitional residue licence conditions is attached (see Attachment A). Standard conditions for long&hyphen;term transitional licences are in the Media Release of 31_October 1996 (see Attachment B). Bound copies of all long term transitional licences will be available in due course from <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the DPIE Shopfront. A bound copy of these <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6869"> licences will be provided to Senator Brown as soon as they become available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) As of 7 November 1996, no degraded forest licences have been issued under the Export Control (Hardwood Wood Chips) (1996) Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) 10 applications for long&hyphen;term transitional licences were rejected. As a number of the unsuccessful applicants have indicated that they may be considering appeals to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal against the Minister's decision not to grant them a licence, it is not appropriate to comment further on the matter. I will be forwarding statements of reasons to unsuccessful applicants. I believe that it is inappropriate for me to provide these statements to persons other than the applicants, but would have no objection to Senator Brown requesting this information from the applicants. The names and addresses of all applicants are at Attachment D.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) Yes:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) See Table 3, Attachment C ;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) The method by which wood is sold to exporters is a matter within the normal commercial operation of timber companies and State forest agencies who own the wood.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) I have not received any correspondence from local processors objecting to the issue of any particular woodchip export licence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6)(a) All of the matters listed in subregulation 7(2) of the Export Control (Unprocessed Wood) Regulations, where relevant, are considered by the Minister in assessing licence applications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) The regulations do not require individual determinations in relation to these matters, but require a Minister to take them into consideration, where relevant, in making a decision on whether to grant or refuse a licence application.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) A similar question to this one was raised by Senator Brown during the recent Senate Estimates Hearings involving this portfolio (reference Senate Estimates <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  Page RRA&amp;T 187 of 20 September 1996)  The Department of Primary Industries and Energy advised the Senate Estimates Committee that it was preparing further information on the proportion of the volume for export that is derived from pulplogs and sawlogs and a response would be provided as soon as the information was available. I am advised that a response on this matter was tabled in the Senate on 7 November 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sawlogs are defined in export licences as logs that are, at the time they are selected for harvesting, considered suitable for use for sawing, veneers, poles, girders and other products of higher value than pulpwood and wood chips. Pulplogs are logs that are not considered suitable for these uses at the time they are selected for harvesting. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>

<PARA><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Senator Conroy  asked:</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Has the Minister's attention been drawn to problems in investor protection for unit trusts? What is the government's view as to the most appropriate regulation of the interests of investors? Is the minister aware of the divergent views on this subject of those in the investment funds industry?</PARA>
<PARA><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Treasurer  has provided the following information in answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unit trusts are currently regulated by the prescribed interests provisions of the Corporations Law. Division 5 of Part 7.12 of the Corporations Law provides that prescribed interest schemes, unless specifically excluded from the operation of the fundraising provisions of the Law, must adopt a particular statutory structure. That structure is two tier in that it requires an independent trustee or representative and an independent management company for a scheme or unit trust. The funds or assets of any scheme are vested in the trustee or representative and the scheme is managed on a day to day basis by the management company. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the end of the 1980s and the start of the 1990s, some unit trusts, particularly unlisted property trusts, faced difficulties. In some cases, unitholders lost large sums of money, and the industry generally suffered a loss of investor confidence. It was in that context that, on 24 May 1991, the then Attorney-General, the Hon Michael Duffy MP, directed the Law Reform Commission and the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee ('the Review') to carry out a thorough examination of the regulatory framework for prescribed interests and `like collective investment schemes'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Review reported in July 1993. The Review concluded that no re-working of the current system for regulating unit trusts could overcome its inherent problems of divided powers and responsibilities and the attendant legal complexity and uncertainty. The Review's fundamental recommendation was that there be a single scheme operator, or responsible entity, in relation to each scheme. All other recommendations largely revolve around and build on the single responsible entity concept.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">An exposure draft Collective Investments Bill, which essentially followed the approach recommended by Review, was released by the previous</PARA>
<PARA><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6873"></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government for 3 months' public exposure in December 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is aware that there are a number of interested groups who believe that the draft Bill does not represent the best way to supervise collective investment schemes (as unit trusts are referred to in the draft Bill) and that there is yet to emerge a broad agreement on the best method for supervising this element of the market. The Government has encouraged key industry participants to consult with each other as a means of reaching an agreed outcome. While it is disappointing that those consultations have not yet produced a consensus, the Government believes that they have been useful in airing the issues surrounding the regulatory regime proposed by the draft Bill, and in canvassing possible options to, or modifications of, that regime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government will shortly consider those options in detail, with a view to deciding the future direction of the proposed collective investments reforms. The Government wishes to satisfy itself that any legislation that it puts forward in this area strikes the right balance between providing effective investor protection and facilitating an efficient financial and investment market for managed funds in Australia.</PARA>
