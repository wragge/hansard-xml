<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Assistant Treasurer representing the Minister for Administrative Services. During the supplementary estimates hearing on the DDB Needham smoking guns affair you stated that the question of whether DDB Needham was on the short list prior to the intervention of Mr Graeme Morris was fundamental to the case being developed by Senator Bolkus and me. Is it a fact that you have now been forced to reveal that the Minister for Administrative Services has now admitted that DAS made a thorough check of its files and could find no written evidence that DDB Needham Adelaide was in fact included on the list of advertising agencies prior to 28 June 1996? Is it not also a fact that this revelation by your own admission confirms that Mr Graeme Morris's fax was a key component of a political fix to guarantee the contract to DDB Needham Adelaide regardless of the quality of their bid?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

I did write to the chairman of the committee, as I am wont to do when it has been pointed out to me that some of the evidence that was given required to be corrected. That is exactly what I did. Senator Ray did read the letter out fairly correctly, as I understand. Senator Ray, you then said that you were building the case. As you know, that letter from Mr Morris was sent. Of course, you argued in the estimates that that led to the listing of DDB Needham.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I definitely will, Madam President, because what is important is that within those figures there is a message for the government and a message for the opposition. The message for the government in opinion polls continuing to firm of this type&mdash;in fact, from 47 per cent at the election up to 51 per cent&mdash;is basically that the electorate believes that the new government is on the right track. There can be no other alternative interpretation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was reinforced by the Lindsay by-election. It is now again being reinforced by public opinion polling.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam President, I ask a supplementary question.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Telstra position is just another demonstration of the hypocrisy of Labor. It was Labor that was opposed to the sale of the Commonwealth Bank and then all of a sudden it sold the Commonwealth Bank. It was Labor that was opposed to the sale of Qantas, and all of a sudden it sold Qantas. It is Labor that suddenly, moving from government into opposition, says, `There's no way we can support the sale of another government utility. There's no way we can support the sale of Telstra.' It is about time Labor started to recognise the bandaid for which this government was elected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to mandate No. 1&mdash;reform to industrial relations&mdash;it is time for them to come on board now and give employees and employers the opportunity to work together on a new industrial relations situation.

There are opportunities before this chamber where Labor can start to become relevant, but on their record so far they have no wish to face up to that responsibility. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

During the term of the previous Labor government, Australia was given: the `recession we had to have'; one million people unemployed; a record high foreign debt; Mr Beazley's $10 billion bankcard bill; and double digit home loan interest rates.

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, Madam President. Madam President, you will be aware that the government, before the election, promised to provide help to families and small business. Perhaps one of the biggest benefits a government can give to families is to provide the environment which allows them to pay low interest rates with the buying of their most valuable asset, the family home. Similarly, small businesses derive enormous benefit from lower interests rates. Lower rates foster higher investment, more jobs and more growth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the election of the coalition, there have been substantial cuts in mortgage interest rates. Senator Cook, who has been calling out recently, may be interested to know that when this government came to office the variable home mortgage rate charged by big banks was 10.5 per cent. Correct? Correct. This has now fallen to 9.25 per cent, a fall of 1&frac14; percentage points. This fall has sliced repayments on a $100,000 loan by approximately $104 per month. For a person on adult average earnings, this is equivalent to an increase in pre-tax income of $160 per month&mdash;because, of course, mortgage costs are paid from after tax income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are now seeing, partly as a result of competition and partly because of the government's good management of the economy&mdash;particularly, of course, with the budget&mdash;that some of the major lenders are offering the lowest home mortgage rates since the 1970s. No wonder the latest Newspoll has shown such buoyant figures for the coalition.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question from Senator Knowles also asked how our record compares with that of Labor. Unfortunately, Senator Knowles, Labor has a rather sorry record on interest rates. It is the high interest rate party, as all Australians know. As I have said, the current mortgage rate charged by the big four banks is 9.25 per cent.

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was the average under Labor&mdash;more than one-third higher than at present. Under Labor, home mortgage rates peaked at a whopping 17 per cent; business lending rates were even higher. As I said yesterday, over the last 2&half; years under Labor, the only way mortgage rates went was up. This is not surprising because over this time official interest rates went up as well. In fact, official interest rates went up to 7.5 per cent. Under Labor variable home mortgage rates last fell in September 1993. In September 1994 they rose three-quarters of a percentage point to 9.5 per cent. Just three months later they rose to 10.5 per cent&mdash;and that is where they stayed right up until the election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The conclusion of all this is very straightforward. It is that Labor is the high interest rate party. Labor failed to bring down interest rates.

Perhaps you were not here yesterday, Senator, so let me give you an idea of the sorts of people who did, in fact, tell you that you were wrong. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  editorial of 8 September 1995 said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Employment minister Mr Crean claims we are on track to cut unemployment to 5 per cent. At best he is deluded and at worst Mr Crean is not telling the truth.</PARA>
<PARA>In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  in September 1995, Professor Helen Hughes said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The unemployment rate not 8.2 per cent would be no better than seven per cent by the year 2000 if present growth levels were maintained.</PARA>
<PARA>Dr John Quiggin, associate professor, said this in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  on 1 September 1995:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no doubt, the government cannot possibly achieve five per cent under its current policies.</PARA>
<PARA>So it is perfectly clear that what I said on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meet the Press</EMPHASIS>  is correct. You were told by plenty of people that you would not get to that target. On that basis, I am quite satisfied with my comments on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meet the Press</EMPHASIS> . I am equally satisfied with the information I gave to the Senate yesterday on this matter, which included the press release of 18 August, and then the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  article of the 19th. I will read that article for you to make it clearer yet again. The press release of 18 August said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DEETYA has advised&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is us&mdash;</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that at the time of the election, on the information available to the previous government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>if you wanted to ask for it&mdash;if it is sounding familiar, it is what you heard yesterday&mdash;you could have asked for it&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">unemployment in 2000 would have been between 6.8 and 7.3 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>What did I tell you yesterday that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  paraphrased that to be? They did not put it in direct quotes, because it was not a direct quote. They paraphrased it. They paraphrased it to be:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Vanstone said that at the time of the March election, her department had advised Mr Crean . . . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to Senator Hill, the Minister for the Environment and the Minister representing the Prime Minister.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We respect the views of the traditional owners in this matter.</PARA>
<PARA>I would like to acknowledge the presence in the gallery this afternoon of the senior traditional owner of Jabiluka country, Yvonne Margarula. She is here on behalf of traditional owners to say very clearly no, they do not want mining on their land, particularly the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4636"> Jabiluka uranium mine. So I ask, Minister: bearing in mind your earlier statements and the wishes of the traditional owners, will the government refuse now to give approval for mining of uranium at Jabiluka?</PARA></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable senator knows, application has been made for a new mine at Jabiluka, and that is currently going through an environmental impact study process. We have indicated that we expect the highest possible standards before we would tick off on that. The senator will also know that we have currently instituted&mdash;in cooperation with ERA, the Northern Territory government and the Northern Lands Council&mdash;a social and cultural study on the effects of industry and mining in the Ranger region, which will be an important information base for us as well. We expect to get that back towards the end of the first half of next year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apart from that, the company, of course, needs approval from the Northern Territory government. It certainly, arguably, legally needs approval. We can go into the fine points of that law if you like, but it is not really appropriate in this forum. It will be a question of, if the traditional owners do have that legal right, whether they approve it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apart from all that, the sentiment of what I said in that earlier answer some time ago really stands: I think the rights of the traditional owners in these matters clearly should be respected. I have received quite a bit of correspondence from Yvonne Margarula, in which she has made her position very clear, and it is consistent with what you have put to the Senate today. I have indicated to my office that I would be pleased to meet with her during her visit in Canberra if that remains her wish, which I understand it to be.</PARA></ANSWER>

These arguments are currently being evaluated by the state government, which is going to report back to the ministerial council in the first quarter of next year. If these arguments are well&hyphen;founded&mdash;and they have got to be analysed carefully&mdash;then obviously they would be balanced against the conservation values for which the road was to be closed.

Senator Collins knows that in my answer I made it perfectly clear that I was quoting not from the report, but from a number of newspaper articles. My exact words were:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it might be illuminating to look at what others have had to say about the special auditor's report. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald&hyphen;Sun</EMPHASIS>  in today's editorial says: the audit . . . reveals a list of shortcomings . . . </PARA>
<PARA>And so on. Senator Collins knows full well that the point I was making was that ATSIC had accepted the value of the special auditor process and the quite serious implications of the findings. The media, after examining the report, took a similar&mdash;if at times somewhat inaccurate&mdash;view in some areas. In fact, the only one hanging in there trying to pretend that the report found nothing and was a waste of time is Senator Collins. His problem is that he painted himself into a very embarrassing corner by failing to wait for the report. Instead, he condemned it in advance: he came out and declared it a waste of time and money and insisted it would find nothing, and he was wrong. He is still pursuing that same tired old exercise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In broad terms, the report found that 272 ATSIC funded organisations receiving $174 million in grants were either not fit and proper, in need of further investigation, or so seriously in breach of grant conditions as to require immediate and close attention. And that's fact, Senator Collins, which you don't acknowledge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The special auditor has also produced a number of recommendations which have been received positively by ATSIC. Senator Bob Collins's problem is that he has egg on his face in this issue and he just doesn't like it. So he keeps pursuing this tired old exercise.

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Chapman for that question. I am very much aware of the management problems in the south&hyphen;east fishery. The failed and discredited Labor government was also aware of them but did nothing. The south&hyphen;east fishery is a Commonwealth fishery that runs from the waters off Sydney, around Tasmania to South Australia. It is the major supplier of fish to the Melbourne and Sydney fish markets and has a gross value of production of some $54 million per year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fishery is managed by a system of output controls known as individual transferable quotas. Since the introduction of the system in 1992, a number of operators have argued that some aspects of the original quota allocation were unfair and reduced the value of their fishing entitlements. The continued wrangling about the initial quota allocation has greatly complicated the management of the fishery. One of the great advantages of a transferable quota system is that operators can <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> buy and sell their entitlements. The existence of a market for quota enables fisheries to adjust themselves to changing conditions. The continued uncertainty in the south&hyphen;east fishery has meant that operators have been reluctant to buy or sell quota. It has also meant that the compliance and enforcement costs associated with the fishery have been higher than necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In December 1993, the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science, Technology, Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, of which Senator Chapman was a very active member, recommended that the Australian Fish Management Authority should explore all the options for adjustment of the fishery, including some form of buy&hyphen;out of operators holding small amounts of quota.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1994 the South-East Trawl Management Advisory Committee prepared a detailed paper on adjustment options in the fishery. In late 1994, nearly two years ago, AFMA wrote to the Minister for Resources outlining a way of approaching the issue. The Labor government did not do anything much about the issue in 1994. In 1995 it actually responded and said that it was still considering the matter. This is the sort of solution that the previous Labor government provided. It thought that if it did nothing, this major problem would go away. It was still thinking about the problem when it was swept from office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4642"> I am pleased to advise the Senate that I have established a working group to recommend adjustment options for the south-east fishery. The working group will consider whether any of the operators in the fishery should receive adjustment assistance. If it decides that adjustment assistance is appropriate, it will develop options for adjustment. The working group will be chaired by Mr David Trebeck, an economic and policy consultant. The group will include two members with an industry background&mdash;Gail Hewitt and Oleh Harasymiw. It will also include a senior executive from the Australian Fisheries Management Authority and one of my own departmental officers. The working group will be required to complete its task by 30 November 1996. The group's recommen dations will then be considered by the South-East Trawl Management Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We promised during the election campaign that we would seek to resolve the endless wrangling in the south-east fishery by mediation, not litigation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As regards the detail of the question, I am happy to refer that to the responsible minister. Let me just say this as an overview. The biggest problem, as everyone will know, when we faced the budget was the fact that we had to overcome years and years of Labor's irresponsible spending. Labor spent billions of dollars of money it did not have. It put the money on the credit cards so that future generations would have to pay. We had no option but to address that problem. Those decisions are not easy decisions, but it is something that had to be done. There was a general acceptance by the public that what we did was fair and equitable. They knew we had to face up to the squandering of people's money by the Labor Party. One of the things that the Labor Party has never understood is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that when it spends money it is spending other people's money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Industry Commission undertook a series of reviews on bounty assistance. Their view in all cases was that bounties were no longer an appropriate means of providing assistance to industry and that they had clearly run their course. After 13 years of Labor, improving the competitiveness of Australian industry is what we have to do. Australia recently had the unenviable honour of suffering the largest slide of any OECD nation on competitiveness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me also say that there are significant benefits to industries in the budget. In relation to books, there are generous transitional arrangements. In the case of computers&mdash;Senator Cook did not raise this, but it covers the whole bounty issue&mdash;the government has convened the information industries task force to consider what form that should take.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unlike Labor, we do not advocate unproductive handouts to industry. We have provided assistance packages across the board, designed to encourage and benefit innovation, management practices and export development strategies. We have also addressed through the budget process the matters which will have a downward impact on interest rates. These are the issues that industry is looking at.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also addressing this through the industrial relations bill, which the Labor Party continues to ignore. Its eyes have remained half closed and its ears half opened to the fact that the Industrial Relations Act, as enacted under Labor, was one of the greatest disincentives to employment that this country has ever seen. Senators on the other side will have their opportunities to show us whether they are serious in addressing the problems that we inherited when we came to government.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Allison for the question which she was good enough to give my office notice of. The government is quite clearly committed to freedom of choice for parents in education. We support a strong government sector and a strong non&hyphen;government sector in school education, which is why we are putting <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> another $167 million for schools into this budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is anticipated that enrolments in non&hyphen;government schools will increase from approximately 920,000 this year to approximately 1.01 million in the year 2000, which is an increase of approximately 10 per cent. But the share of non&hyphen;government school enrolments as a proportion of total school enrolments is anticipated to increase over this time only from 29.4 per cent to 31.8 per cent&mdash;that is, if you look at the numbers increasing, you come up with that percentage but, if you look at the share, it is not as marked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will not be any change to funding for government schools if the government sector can continue to maintain its enrolments. That is the key to it all. The money, in a sense, will follow the students. As a result of cost shifting in the states between government and non&hyphen;government schools since 1983, states and territories have saved more than $3 billion. Any movement of a student in a government school to a non&hyphen;government school saves the states and territories on average $3,403. What the government is proposing will actually reduce the incentive of states and territories to shift students into non&hyphen;government schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth government is increasing assistance to government schools at a better rate than to non&hyphen;government schools taking into account both financial assistance grants and specific purpose payments. Between 1996 and the year 2000 average per capita Commonwealth funding for a student in a government school is estimated to increase from approximately $2,263 to $2,668&mdash;or an increase of 17.9 per cent&mdash;while, for the same period, Commonwealth funding for a non&hyphen;government school student will increase by 14.9 per cent. So the increase for the student in a government school is 17.9 per cent and for the non&hyphen;government school, 14.9 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is obviously strongly committed to improving school education opportunities for all students across the whole curricula but especially in literacy, vocational education and training and Aboriginal literacy. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4644"> I think that therefore answers all of your questions, Senator.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp), to a question without notice asked by Senator Robert Ray today, relating to the tendering process for an advertising contract won by DDB Needham, Adelaide.</PARA>
<PARA>This particular matter has quite a history because what Senator Kemp was answering the question on today was misleading evidence at the estimates committee&mdash;and I commend him for correcting the record so rapidly; an example that some of his colleagues should follow. What Senator Kemp does not understand, I think, because he was not involved previously, is that this is the second major correction that has come through on this particular subject.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4645">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 30 September, at the initial estimates committee hearing, I asked the following question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Were there any suggestions made by ministers, their staff or parliamentary secretaries, or other member of parliament who should be on this list?</PARA>
<PARA>The witness said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not that I recall, Senator.</PARA>
<PARA>I went on to ask:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But you have no recollection that a particular firm or two may have been suggested by the Attorney&hyphen;General's office or by Mr Jull or anyone else?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer was no. I asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no notation on the record anywhere that will assist with that?</PARA>
<PARA>The reply was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not that I am familiar with.</PARA>
<PARA>I then said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You would certainly remember if they struck one off or wrote one in?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer was yes. So, on 30 September, there was a total denial that anyone had written or interfered in the tendering process. But what did we get when the estimates committee resumed? We got a statement read before the committee saying, `I am sorry. All that evidence is wrong. Mr Morris, the chief political adviser to the Prime Minister, did in fact write and this message was received on 28 June 1996.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there has been a complete recantation of the evidence to that point. We went on to examine these matters and we asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Can you say to me whether Mr Morris's intervention had any effect on your thinking as to who goes on the list of five?</PARA>
<PARA>The OGIA witness said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No, as I said earlier, DDB Needham were already on the list before I received the fax.</PARA>
<PARA>I went on and just double-checked that, and I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But you are saying that you had DDB Needham on a list before Mr Morris rang and discussed it with you.</PARA>
<PARA>The answer given was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is right.</PARA>
<PARA>Yet what do we have now? We have the Assistant Treasurer writing back to us to say, `I am sorry, that evidence is wrong yet again. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> We can't find any written evidence that DDB Needham Adelaide was in fact on the list prior to Mr Morris's fax.' What we have asserted throughout is that it was Mr Morris who intervened to get DDB Needham Adelaide on the list. All the evidence given so far at both hearings is now absolutely null and void.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I raised in the supplementary estimates committee that the fact is the other four firms put on the list of five had an average billing rate of $47.8 million a year, yet this tiny little outfit in Adelaide had a billing rate of $5.8 million a year. The fact is&mdash;with its two principals, Toby Ralph and John King, working full time on the federal election campaign, employed by state directors Minchin and Morris&mdash;DDB Needham suddenly got the nod to get on to the list.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some more interesting facts about Senator Kemp. Once Senator Kemp learned the news that they were on the list before Mr Morris wrote his fax, there was a big breakout at the estimates committee. There was great fun to be had by Senator Kemp. The transcript of the hearing states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sequence given by Ms Moore was that DDB Needham was put on the list prior to any letter, we understand, from Mr Morris. So the claims that you&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>meaning me&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">are making that there was an intervention, even at the first stage, are yet to be demonstrated.</PARA>
<PARA>Well, aren't they demonstrated now? He goes on, though, and says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But it is a fundamental issue, Senator Ray, is it not? You are trying to build a case against Mr Morris, but the evidence that has been tendered to this committee is that DDB Needham were put on the list prior to that letter which was received by Ms Moore. It is a fairly fundamental point, is it not?</PARA>
<PARA>Well, isn't it! All that evidence is wrong and the fact is that all the defence Senator Kemp put up is wrong. This has happened on not one occasion; it has happened on two occasions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind the Senate that we are dealing with a new minister. I did pass on one piece of advice during the hearings to Senator Kemp. When he was answering questions I <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4646"> said, `Now, look, minister. Let me give you a bit of advice. Preface every answer by saying, "I am advised".' In future, Senator Kemp, when you are sitting at the table not taking questions on notice, trying to obfuscate, trying to defend the government, follow my advice. This particular matter is two strikes against this government.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This really shows just how low the stocks have dropped in the Labor Party. When there is no other issue to raise, when things are going so badly, in comes Senator Ray to ask the first question. He disappears for the rest of question time to try and find a bit more information and then comes back in to take note of an answer. Their stocks have dropped that low. Senator Ray, you constantly will need to be reminded of your own statement in estimates. You said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Minister, it doesn't matter whether Mr Morris had anything to do with it in the end. What matters is that a ministerial committee has chosen the firm.</PARA>
<PARA>Then you say that because the Adelaide firm has a turnover of only $5.8 million they should not qualify in front of the other firms. Don't you like small business? It gives you an idea of just how far your stocks have gone in the Labor Party. It is typical of your tactics when you have gone so low in every other area that you try and trawl through with Senator Bolkus, who has had a lot of practice at this sort of thing, to find an issue out of nothing at all. It is simply a vendetta against Mr Grahame Morris, a very successful person within the Prime Minister's office and within Liberal Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You talked earlier about it being Mr Jull's responsibility. How come not one Labor shadow minister in the other place has bothered to even ask Mr Jull one question? Not one question.</PARA>

Then again only a week ago in the Lindsay by-election, another five or six per cent of them decided they had had enough of this party.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no doubt that when a fish stinks it stinks from the head. In this particular case, not only have we got a stink but it emanates from all the Prime Minister's men. We are not just targeting Mr Morris in respect of this, Senator Ferguson. What we have here is a fix, through which it has become patently clear today that the firm which got the job should never have got it. They got it because of political intervention, stemming from the Prime Minister's office, stemming from the Prime Minister's closest advisers, delivered to the Prime Minister's and the apparatchiks' closest mates before the election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This one goes to the heart of government. All the Prime Minister's men are involved here. They are involved in not just rorting a tender but also plundering the Medicare levy&mdash;a levy which the Australian public has paid extra in good faith. In doing so, they are rorting and aborting a very important campaign. This is a fix to reward your mates. It stinks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the House of Representatives this afternoon for every question asked of the relevant ministers they could not answer. The bottom line was: whether it was Williams, or the Prime Minister or whoever it was, they could not answer the detail and they could not justify the rort that they have all been involved in. This will go on. This will continue and this is a warning we give you now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Kemp, when he was answering questions last week,  did not expect to come in here today to say, `Hold it. We got it wrong last week. We misled the Senate on a very fundamental point in this process.' He did not expect to do that. I am sure further on down the track that other ministers will also not be expecting to come back, but you will have to keep on coming back until we have a full and open inquiry into this matter which will expose the rort that Senator Minchin rode straight to the home post. Senator Minchin was the driving force behind this, not just Mr Morris. It is quite apparent from all the evidence that they were the ones who wanted <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to reward their mates in a small little firm from Adelaide whose Sydney operation was in a state of crisis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have here a breach of the Prime Minister's code of conduct. There was an improper benefit provided through political intervention by those close to the Prime Minister's office&mdash;an improper benefit contrary to the principles laid down by the Prime Minister. This is a rort. The firm that got the contract rated last. They got the contract because they were mates&mdash;they had known Morris for 10 years; they had worked with Senator Minchin for some time; they had worked with Mr Georgiou in the Victorian campaign. It was a reward to their mates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only was it a reward but they acted in the dark, contrary to the basic principles of tendering laid down and adopted by this government. What did they do when the decision was taken? They kicked the public servants out. The rules state very clearly that public servants should expect to be there for the deliberations of the campaign. What did they do? They closed up shop, kicked them out about 11 o'clock and deliberated on their own&mdash;their own grubby little deal to benefit their mates. The process was corrupted. The process was stacked at the start in terms of who was on the committee. The process was stacked time and time again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The advertising agency that got the contract did not even rate on the government's 1,000 tenderers list before this process started. They were not on that list when the decision was taken. They were put on the final list by Mr Morris's intervention&mdash;intervention quite critical to Senator Kemp's backdown today. On 7 June, 10 agencies were on OGIA's list of preferred agencies. DDB Needham was not one of them. By 28 June, after the Morris letter, as has become very clear today, DDB Needham was put on the list. The list of 10 was cut back to six. Five were dropped off but DDB Needham was put on the list. That is the evidence that we had to have corrected today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fixing this rort, what did you do? You commissioned $90,000 worth of important research. What did you do with that research? You ditched it. It was irrelevant. Elliot and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4648"> Shanahan conducted focus groups with 34 groups throughout the country. They got the response. The advice from OGIA, your professionals, was that DDB Needham should not have got it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then when the list was cut back to three a firm that was not in the first 1,000, a firm that was not in the first 10, a firm that was close to the Liberal Party and the apparatchiks of the other side was now in the final three. Senator Minchin worked overtime to ensure it got up. Not only that, having spent money on research, having got your mates in, what did you do? You can shake your head all you like because the stink starts with you, Senator Minchin. We know it very well. You then rorted the campaign, the focus of the campaign. That is what you did.</PARA>

Let me just remind senators on the other side, especially Senator Ray and Senator Bolkus who have had some sort of righteous conversion on the road to opposition and now feign indignation, about the letting of a contract to market the disability reform package. This was back in 1992-93. There was a plan to market the disability reform package&mdash;a $5 million package.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator McMullan chaired the ministerial council. A list of advertising agencies&mdash;which <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> included DDB Needham Pty Ltd Sydney, Saatchi and Saatchi, the Ball Partnership and John Singleton, which are major advertising agencies&mdash;was put forward on the first tranche of the discussions about the letting of this contract. But, oh no, Senator McMullan was not happy with that. He did not want one of the leading companies. He said, `Could we find a company who has a more creative approach?' Guess who was found? A company called Corporate Impacts, headed by none other than an Anne Gorman who had been a candidate for Labor preselection in the 1973 election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said at the time when I was looking at that investigation that the fact that she had connections with the Labor Party was not an issue. Yet they are saying on the other side that once you have had an association with a party you cannot ever have a contract with them. You are barred for life. They did not look at it that way, but we said when we were pursuing that issue that that was not a problem&mdash;that because you had done business with a party, that should not preclude you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Corporate Impacts in fact set up a little company called Social Impacts in 1983 to inform business about Labor Party policy when they got into government because Labor had been out of power so long they would not understand the policy. Was there any sort of check done on them? No. On the other side of this place today they are saying, `Oh, but DDB Needham Adelaide only had small contracts. They shouldn't have been chosen.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me tell you that the contract that Corporate Impacts got was 50 per cent larger than any other contract they had had with any government&mdash;state or federal. In fact, that company was balance sheet insolvent when it got the contract&mdash;balance sheet insolvent for a $5 million contract. And those opposite have the gall to come in here and criticise the way we chose a company when they chose a company that was balance sheet insolvent for a $5 million contract. It is just a joke that they now have all this righteousness&mdash;this feigned indignation&mdash;about the fact that there was some sort of scandal in the way in which this contract was let.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4649">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me tell you there was a real smell about the way that contract was let. But, no, not one person on the other side wanted to be associated with or talk about it. Then we wanted an inquiry, and who voted against the inquiry? The Labor Party, because they could not see anything wrong with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What happened to that company when it got that contract? It went into liquidation before the contract was finished. It left people with disabilities without being paid. It did not pay its tax&mdash;$64,000 was left owing to the Taxation Office. It was an absolute debacle from beginning to end, but we did not hear one word from the other side.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have exactly the same thing this time with the ministerial council and somehow that company getting on to the list. It was not there in the beginning but it got on the list the second time round. When we rang every one of those advertising agencies they said to us, `We would never have put in a tender if we'd been really told the truth about what this tender was supposed to be about&mdash;the fact that they wanted a creative way of network marketing. We're not into that.' Every one of the companies that my office rang individually said to us that this was an absolute disgrace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And you have the gall to come in here and say that something has been fixed! Let me tell you that you have a record that stinks.

You would think, from the way the Labor Party are going on about this, that they want to ruin the campaign. They do not seem to be terribly interested in the campaign to get those guns back in. If they were, they would be supporting the government in getting the very best campaign going. For all of the accusations and the vindictive following of particular people <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4651"> involved in this, the Labor Party have not come up with anything of substance. What they do understand, having been defeated so magnificently at the last election, is that the people involved have some real skills in understanding advertising contracts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have the utmost confidence in the people whose professional skills the government has relied upon in its selection of a management agency. I was not all that confident with the previous government's people. We had Rod Cameron, who I think has done the ALP research for so many years that we cannot remember, who seemed to get all of the government contracts. And who was that other fellow? Singleton. He seemed to get a hell of a lot of government contracts as well. I suppose it is just coincidence that, having got all those government contracts, both of them happened to do all the Labor Party's work. I suppose you will say to me that all of the work he did for the government did not help him in the advice he gave to the ALP on how they should pitch their campaigns.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. The Coalition's decision to abolish operational subsidies for community based long day care centres will result in these centres having to charge higher fees, which will again discriminate against working parents; and</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Motion No. 289 was a motion I gave notice of yesterday in relation to the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996. The reason I wanted to move the motion was that we felt we were going to be required to deal with the workplace relations bill immediately. It was, in fact, really a new bill, because there was an agreement between the Democrats and the government which actually provided a further 170 amendments. We now see that there are amendments from the ALP, and there are further amendments from the Democrats.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an extremely important bill. I know we have had weeks where the committee sought the opinion of people from around Australia but, in effect, we are talking about not only a different bill but a whole range of issues associated with the bill on which we are <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> required to make a considered opinion. These are issues which are likely to affect just about every working person in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that we make good decisions and good legislation. To be forced to deal blindly with those issues after 50 hours of discussions to which the Senate has not been privy&mdash;which I believe is bad process&mdash;is not good democratic process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The motion seeks two weeks to enable us to consider properly the issues and the hundreds of amendments that are now in circulation. This would enable us to make good decisions in this chamber. I think it is not unreasonable to ask for at least a couple of days to look at these issues. Fifty hours equals a couple of months of various discussions. That would have been preferable, but that is not reasonable considering that we have given commitments to deal with the bill in this session.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To ask for two weeks is not unreasonable. But it is not reasonable to renege on agreements that have been made in the leaders' meetings. We are now not dealing with Telstra&mdash;there are other bills that could be dealt with. We are being forced in a very shoddy way to go back to the industrial relations bill. This is not the way to make good legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to voice my strongest opposition to any proposal to change the order of the bills we were going to deal with&mdash;that is, Telstra first, on which we still have a couple of speakers left, and then the workplace relations bill. A lot of people are not in a position at the moment to participate in the committee stage of the workplace relations bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I want to take this opportunity to put on record my most sincere congratulations to Senator Hill for the flexibility that he is demonstrating in the management of the government's legislative program! One day he indicates to the Senate that we will be proceeding with the debate on the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. Then, because the government has failed to get its act together, he <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4661"> indicates that we will defer the debate on that bill until further notice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next day he proposes that we complete the second reading debate on the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill before we resume the committee stage debate on the workplace relations bill. The next day, because the negotiations with the Democrats have been concluded, Telstra is no longer, apparently, the priority it was and the committee stage debate of the workplace relations bill is to come on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This flexibility from Senator Hill would be very admirable for a circus clown or an acrobat, but it is not very admirable flexibility in this chamber. It is not appropriate behaviour for someone who is responsible for the management of the government's legislative program in this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How is anyone seriously expected to believe the protestations that we have heard from the government about the importance of these issues that are before the Senate&mdash;the vital urgency of the flagship bills of this coalition government&mdash;when it is the same government that is continually suspending debate on these bills, changing its mind as to what the priorities might be and deferring debate in this chamber on that legislation? How is anyone expected to seriously and sensibly debate this legislation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government gave its commitment very recently to a particular order for debate for legislation&mdash;that is, that we would complete the Telstra second reading debate in the early part of this week before moving on to the workplace relations committee stage debate. This government has simply failed to honour those commitments that were given to the opposition and to other parties in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the opposition has argued for for a long time in relation to these processes in the Senate is some certainty. Anyone at all in the government from the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) down who suggests that it is the opposition that is preventing debate on its legislative program has now had exposed to them the sheer hypocrisy of such a claim. It is the government's own inept handling of its own program that has led to this situation.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to remind the Senate that Senator Hill said on 20 May this year in relation to bringing on the Telstra bill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But when it comes to the Senate, the Labor Party, the Democrats and the Greens do not even have the courage to do that. What a lot of wimps!</PARA>

<PARA>When the opposition and minor parties were ready to debate the committee stage of the workplace relations bill, it was this government that decided it would not proceed with that debate. It is this government now that is deciding not to proceed with the second reading of the Telstra legislation.</PARA>

It is No. 8! That is the priority that this government is giving this bill, having given a commitment to me, to the Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate, to the Opposition Whip in the Senate as well as to minor parties in the Senate that the second reading debate on the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill would be concluded before the Senate moved to the committee stage of the workplace relations bill.

This is the last paragraph I <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> want to quote from a very interesting article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> . It says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">But Senator Hill was trapped yesterday because he had already struck a deal with the Senate to fast track the Telstra debate.</PARA>
<PARA>It is true. Senator Hill did sit around the table with me and, as I said, Senator Carr and Senator Evans from the opposition and other senators and give commitments about the program. He asked for cooperation from the opposition&mdash;which he has received and has acknowledged publicly he has received.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the opposition says&mdash;through you, Madam Acting Deputy President&mdash;back to Senator Hill is that we expect some level of cooperation from the government. We expect the government to honour commitments it makes at round the table meetings that include Senator Hill and the soon&hyphen;to&hyphen;be Manager of Government Business in this place, Senator Campbell. We expect it to honour those commitments to the opposition and to the minor parties. It is not an unreasonable thing, in my view, for senators in this place, given proper procedures and an understanding of the way in which this place works, to expect from the government that, if commitments are given by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, he will honour them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday, when everyone, as far as I am aware, had been proceeding on the assumption that we would be continuing the second reading debate on the Telstra bill, the government at the last minute tried to defer debate and bring on the workplace relations bill. Naturally enough we complained. I complained when I received what I thought was a rather pathetic call from Senator Hill saying, `I've got a problem.' He did have a problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From the point of view of the opposition, we had not even been briefed, of course, on the latest backflips by the government on the workplace relations bill. Apparently even the government eventually agreed it would be unreasonable to expect senators to launch into the debate on 171 amendments, most of which had not been made available to a substantial number of senators in this place. And then it appears that the government&mdash;at least for 24 hours&mdash;reverted to the original arrangement to proceed with Telstra.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4663">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth of the matter is that the Senate could easily have completed the second reading debate on Telstra yesterday, and it could have voted on the bill. But what did the government do? They dredged right down, they stooped right into the bottom of the barrel, and found Senator Ian Macdonald and Senator MacGibbon to be added to the speakers list in the second reading debate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I really think that senators, those in the press gallery and interested observers should ask themselves what this really says about the government's view of the urgency of the Telstra bill. What does it say about the government's posturing, claiming Senate obstructionism of its legislation program?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition's position on the programming of these two bills has been clear and consistent. We agreed to complete the second reading debate of the Telstra bill and then proceed to the committee stage of the workplace relations bill. That remains our position <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and our preference. It remains a position that the government, through the Leader of the Government in the Senate and other responsible government office holders, had agreed to a matter of days ago. It is because of that, Senator Margetts, that we indicated that we would not be supporting your motion for a deferral of the committee stage debate on the workplace relations bill until 18 November. We gave a commitment to all parties in the Senate about how and when we would debate this matter and we intend to honour it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I recognise that the government has the numbers to enforce its proposed change of program, I think it is not unreasonable for all senators in this chamber to expect a degree of integrity when a government gives commitments about the listing of legislation, even though we see the government breach its word regularly on these matters. Every member of this chamber knows that when the opposition gives a commitment to adopt a course of action in this place it is honoured.

That is a disgraceful set of circumstances for us to find ourselves in. It is a total abrogation of the responsibility of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4665"> Democrats to see that those amendments have time to go out to the public, the community groups, the unions, the conservation groups and the social justice groups so that their impact can be analysed, their feedback can come to their representatives in this chamber and then we can have a representative debate on that public feedback.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That obligation rests very heavily on the shoulders of the Democrats, not least their leader. But they have knocked it from their own shoulders.

I reiterate that this chamber ought to be endorsing the very reasonable move by Senator Margetts and say, `Well, after two months of debate behind closed doors, let's at least extend for a fortnight or three weeks for the wider public to be taken into account.' The wider public has been locked out. Votes on these amendments begin today, this week.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4666">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I referred earlier to hypocrisy. I think one of the problems is that the Greens actually were not involved in these particular negotiations. They were involved in behind&hyphen;closed&hyphen;doors negotiations with the previous government and us on native title. You cannot say that it is okay for one issue but not okay for another.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us deal with the matter of how widely these issues have been canvassed. We have had 1,431 submissions; we have had 18 days of public hearings; we have had a Senate report; and a supplementary report with second reading debates attached to that. Our position was clearly signalled in our supplementary report. We have had ongoing and continuing consultation with the ACTU, the ACCI and other employee and employer organisations. We have had constant correspondence and constant telephone interaction. I would be very surprised if senators from either side of the chamber have also not had that experience. This is and will remain a hot issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had one of my more enlightening and enlivening experiences on the public hearings. As you know, I am a new senator. I was sitting in the hearings and I suddenly heard this disembodied voice descending from the rafters and I discovered that there is a process whereby senators not able to attend hearings can, in fact, do it audiovisually and I was most impressed. So it is true that Senator Margetts did follow the hearings as far as she could.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recall that I was developing a line of questioning with a representative of the government of Western Australia in Perth which was particularly effective and Senator Margetts appreciated it so much that she hopped ahead of me in the queue and took my line of questioning and got some good media coverage from it. I appreciated the political skill that involved. I was not in Tasmania. My colleague Senator Allison was. Perhaps Senator Brown was there; I do not know. I do not know how much Senator Brown has been involved in this issue or how much his passion has suddenly emerged to make some political points.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not as if these amendments introduce brand&hyphen;new concepts. What we have done has been to make the bill fairer and more balanced. It is not a new bill; nothing new has been raised; all issues have been canvassed. It has been in the public arena prior to, during and following the election. This debate and these amendments will not be over in five minutes. This is going to go on for some days and I have the confidence, even if you do not, Senator Brown, that the very capable members of the opposition, many of them with deep union experience, will get right on top of these issues and these amendments and will produce a very spirited debate in the Committee of the Whole. I have far more confidence in the remaining senators in this chamber than you do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We took Labor amendments with us into the negotiations. From what we could glean, we took the Greens' concerns, which included those on the environment. Unfortunately, they were not ready with their amendments as soon as Labor were, so we could not take those amendments in with us.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Faulkner moving a motion relating to the conduct of the business of the Senate, namely a motion to give precedence to general business notice of motion No. 284.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a very important issue for the Senate. At the recent estimates hearings, the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs revealed that they had written to Minister Vanstone's office to draw their attention `to the incorrect reporting in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  on 19 August' which inferred that the department had advised the former Labor government that the five per cent unemployment rate was unachievable. The department was concerned at the incorrect inference in this article, attributed to Senator Vanstone, that the department had advised the former Labor government that the five per cent target was unachievable. Certainly, the department was not the only one to draw that inference. I think it would have been very obvious to any reader of not only the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  article but also the press release from Senator Vanstone on which the article was based. That press release says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similarly, DEETYA has advised that at the time of the election, on information available to the previous government, unemployment in 2000 would have been between 6.8 and 7.3 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both forecasts provide clear evidence of the deceit in Labor's election campaign. . . </PARA>
<PARA>I would argue that the inference here is very deliberate. Clearly, neither the incorrect inference in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  nor that in the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> minister's press release were of any concern to the minister herself. In fact, she ignored the department's advice. She repeated her statements on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meet the press</EMPHASIS>  program on 24 August and she repeated her statements again in the Senate on 10 September.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have argued here for some time that Senator Vanstone displayed the same disdain for accuracy that she showed in relation to the evidence over the Wright family and the same disdain for accuracy and the truth that she showed in her answer to a similar dorothy dix question on the issue of the Democrats' Internet home page. We have said very clearly that this level of disdain for the parliament, for ministerial responsibility and for ensuring that the public record is accurate is absolutely unacceptable&mdash;totally unacceptable in a government minister. It is unacceptable, in my view, in any public figure at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John Howard, the Prime Minister, took the same view in his much vaunted ministerial guidelines. He quickly retreated when he realised the impossibility of imposing such high standards on his ministers. Now he is in the process of rewriting these very same guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a direct parallel between the information being sought in this return to order and the case of the bogus Wright family. Again, the department rightly drew the minister's attention to the inaccuracies in press reports, which again were based on the minister's statements. At least in that particular case the minister agreed to release a departmental advice. She should do the same here. We are asking for this precedent to be followed in this case. We believe that this is a perfectly reasonable request.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that the minister twice repeated her assertions about the deceit of the Labor Party in maintaining, against the advice of DEETYA, a purportedly unachievable unemployment target, we also want to know whether the department brought this matter to her attention again after these subsequent statements. It seems to me that this is an open and shut case of a minister being required to fulfil a ministerial responsibility. I would ask for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4668"> support for the suspension of standing orders. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What Senator Faulkner is doing is himself actually misleading the Senate and, out of misleading the Senate, attempting to paint a picture that Senator Vanstone shows, in his terms, disdain for the truth. He did it firstly in relation to the so-called Wright matter. That matter was explained by the department, which gave the minister an apology for the incorrect information it had provided. But that is not conceded by Senator Faulkner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He has instead come in here day after day and, either explicitly or by implication, said that Senator Vanstone deliberately misled the estimates committee. That is not so. Similarly in relation to this matter, what he is seeking to allege out of a press release that Senator Vanstone issued is again that in some way that statement was misleading, when there is no evidence in fact that it is misleading at all. The statement said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similarly, DEETYA has advised that at the time of the election, on information available to the previous government, unemployment in 2000 would have been between 6.8 and 7.3 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a statement she has made, a statement that she is prepared to support. That was then interpreted in a subsequent press report, and then the department wrote Senator Vanstone saying that the press report was misleading. The opposition has not even sought to make out the case that the statement Senator Vanstone made in the press release was misleading. Yet, the impression Senator Faulkner is seeking to create in this place is that in some way she has disdain for the truth. That is why what he is seeking to do is misleading and grossly unfair. It is good sport for Senator Faulkner, I understand, but the record is entitled to stand as it is, rather than as Senator Faulkner would wish it to be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He takes this one step further and comes in here today and says that he is entitled to seek a return to order basically for all information relating to the matter, whether or not it is relevant to the issue of whether Senator Vanstone has evidence to substantiate the statement she put in her press release. All <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> advice, as I recall it, relating to unemployment projections was in the form of his notice of motion, not advices that might substantiate the argument Senator Vanstone put in her press release. In doing so, Senator Faulkner again alleges that she has been misleading during the course of this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The important thing is: is there a case to suspend standing orders to require the passage of this return to order? Firstly, there isn't because no urgency has been established at all, or even an attempt by Senator Faulkner to establish an urgency. Secondly, what he is subsequently going to seek goes far beyond the evidence for the case that he is trying to make. Thirdly, this is fishing. This is the practice that this opposition is now adopting day after day with returns to order without making out any prima facie case at all, fishing for all documents that are possible in order to find something that can exploit a political opportunity.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That there be laid on the table, by 5 pm on Tuesday, 29 October 1996, by the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Affairs (Senator Vanstone), copies of any advice to her from her department relating to unemployment projections up to the year 2000 and her statements about the purported unachievability of the Australian Labor Party's target of 5 per cent unemployment by the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA>I feel it might be useful in relation to this particular issue to remind the Senate of the history of this particular matter. The issue first came to light on 19 August in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  newspaper. In a newspaper article at that time it was stated by Senator Vanstone that, at the time of the March election, her department had advised Mr Crean, the then employment minister, that unemployment by the year 2000 would have been, at best, 6.8 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That particular newspaper article caused Senator Vanstone's department to confirm, after it was published, that they in fact moved to inform the minister that Mr Crean was advised about `a range of conditions that would need to be met to achieve the former government's five per cent unemployment rate target by the turn of the century'. The department says it `did not put any view on the most likely outcome or suggest any particular level below which the unemployment rate was likely to fall'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That information has been confirmed by the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs in answer to question No. 232 asked by my colleague Senator Carr of Mr Hollway at the Senate estimates legislation committee hearing on budget 1996-97. In fact, it appears in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> at page 228. This is the question that Senator Carr asked on notice:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the case, Mr Hollway, that the department has written to the minister disassociating itself from the comments that it did not advise the previous Labor government that five per cent was achievable?</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Can we have a copy of that advice?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer that was subsequently provided was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The department has written the office of the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs to draw the attention of the office to the incorrect reporting in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> &mdash;</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4670">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">which inferred that the department had advised the former Labor government that the five per cent unemployment rate was unachievable.</PARA>
<PARA>The answer goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The last written advice on this matter which was provided by the department to the former Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Simon Crean, was on the conditions which would need to be met in order to achieve the government's five per cent unemployment rate target by the turn of the century. The department did not put any view on the most likely outcome or suggest any particular level below which the unemployment rate was unlikely to fall.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Carr may not agree with me here but I think it is fair to say that the second part of his question on notice&mdash;`Can we have a copy of that advice?'&mdash;was not adequately canvassed in that particular answer from the department.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="CARR" NAMEID="AW5">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Any reasonable person would come to that conclusion.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now, Madam Acting Deputy President, on 25 August Senator Vanstone, the responsible minister, repeated her untruth on Channel 10's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meet the Press </EMPHASIS>program.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="HILL" NAMEID="BH4">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator Hill</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, she didn't. You keep alleging that. You think that if you say that often enough, people will believe you.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5K4">Senator FAULKNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Hill, one thing that people do believe is that Senator Vanstone has a most miserable record as a minister in this government. I must say, in relation to so many issues, the only reason that the truth has come out in relation to the way in which Minister Vanstone has conducted her responsibilities and administered her portfolio is the constant questioning by the Labor opposition and the demanding of the sorts of advices that would be required to be produced by the minister if the motion before the chair is successful.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I stand by my words that Senator Vanstone repeated her untruth on Channel <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 10's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meet the Press</EMPHASIS> program on 25 August. She said, and I quote from the transcript:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Labor knew before the election that its target of 5 per cent by the year 2000 was unachievable. It had been told that. I know that's absolutely true.</PARA>
<PARA>She also then went on to say that there was `no point in lying to the Australian people about the unemployment program'. They are Senator Vanstone's words.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then, on 10 September in the Senate, Senator Vanstone repeated this untruth for a third time. She did that in response to a question that was asked by Senator Bolkus in this chamber. And that is also in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record for all interested senators to see. She said in response to Senator Bolkus:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is my understanding, that the Labor Party knew well that the target it was promoting as achievable was not achievable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If you want to allege I am wrong, I am happy for you to do so and I am happy to check the matter out.</PARA>
<PARA>They are Senator Vanstone's own words: `I am happy to check the matter out.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But when the opposition starts to question Senator Vanstone more closely about this issue, when we try to get to the nitty&hyphen;gritty, Senator Vanstone is not happy for the matter to be checked out at all. Senator Bolkus went on with what I thought was a most searching supplementary question. He asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Did you receive any other advice from your department to confirm your <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meet the Press</EMPHASIS>  statement?</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Vanstone's response:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have nothing further to add.</PARA>
<PARA>Not `yes', not `no'; just `I have nothing further to add.' That is the usual way, Senator Vanstone, in which you respond to questions in this place: you, the minister who has come into this newly elected government with the philosophy of `I don't have to answer your question unless I want to'. That is the philosophy you have adopted from day one. And you have been exposed, of course, and I must say that I think that attitude that you have had has been&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5K4">Senator FAULKNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not an issue of not saying that. The issue is Senator Vanstone's approach: `I won't answer your questions. I won't give you the information unless I want to.' That is Senator Vanstone's approach to ministerial accountability. There is no doubt that is one of the reasons that Senator Vanstone's reputation as a minister has become so tarnished in just the eight months since the election of this government. I think she has been exposed in the public arena as a minister who will do anything to cover up her actions unless, or until, she has been exposed by constant questioning and the actions of the opposition in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, Madam Acting Deputy President, we know that on 22 October the department detailed the advice in the form that I indicated earlier. It detailed the advice and corrected the statement by the minister in her 19 August pronouncement in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> after a question was put on notice by the Labor opposition. We know that advice was made available to members of the Senate estimates committee on 22 October; of course, we know that was, in fact, a day before the estimates committee met. The committee met on 23 October&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Wednesday.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5K4">Senator FAULKNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was Wednesday, 23 October. On this occasion, Senator Chris Evans asked this question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is there any other aspect of the report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  which was incorrect?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Dr Volker</EMPHASIS> &mdash;Not that I can recollect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr Grant</EMPHASIS> &mdash;I have the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  report in front of me. Certainly, the statement which caused us to advise the minister's office was the suggestion that the department had advised Mr Crean, when employment minister, that unemployment by the year 2000 would have been at best 6.8 per cent. We gave no such advice to Mr Crean.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Evans went on to ask:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In your view, is there any way that such a conclusion could be fairly drawn from the advice given to the former minister, Mr Crean?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr Grant</EMPHASIS> &mdash;No, there is not.</PARA>
<PARA>And so the estimates go on. The Mr Grant in question, as I understand it, is the First Assistant Secretary of the Economic and Policy Analysis Division of the Department of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. His evidence to the Senate estimates committee was very clear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want the Senate to reflect on the fact that, in the case of the Wright saga, Senator Vanstone was exposed of perpetrating a massive fraud not only in terms of misleading the Senate but also, and I think more importantly, in terms of misleading the public, the Australian people. There were newspaper articles splashed all around Australia about this massive fraud and she did absolutely nothing either in a parliamentary sense or in a public sense to correct the record. The only reason she acted at all was, again, that the opposition asked questions of relevant ministers, including questions I asked a day later to Senator Newman in a Senate estimates committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said in an earlier debate, we could smell the Liberal Party dead cat that was dragged across the track in relation to this particular matter, but Senator Vanstone, in relation to the Wrights, actually decided after continual pressure from the media and from the opposition in parliament to table documents in this place. She was forced to table documents in this place. It is Senator Vanstone who has set the precedent in relation to this particular matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why will Senator Vanstone not agree to take the same action as she did with the Wrights in relation to this particular matter? I pose the question: what does Senator Vanstone have to hide? I pose the question: why is she involved in a cover-up of these proportions? If it was good enough in the case of the Wrights, why is it not good enough in this particular case?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What Senator Vanstone is establishing here is very clear: a pattern of unacceptable ministerial behaviour, a pattern of abusing the parliament, of misleading the parliament and of misleading the public. It is not only the parliament that has been misled. It is not only the Senate and Senate estimates committees that have been misled but also the public that has been misled with regard to these particular matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Vanstone thinks nothing about articles on the bogus Wright family being <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4672"> splashed right across the newspapers of this country and on every talkback radio show and nothing about ever going back and apologising to those people where the bogus information has been used. She thinks nothing of peddling untruths and inaccuracies in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper, on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meet the Press</EMPHASIS> or in the parliament on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, you really do not know the difference between right and wrong. I really do not believe that you do understand the very serious obligations that are placed on you as a minister. It is for that reason, Minister, that, as far as we in the opposition are concerned, we intend to hold you accountable for your actions. We want to see what advice your department gave you in relation to this particular matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very disappointed that you have not taken the same course of action you were forced to take in relation to the Wrights&mdash;that is, eventually, kicking and screaming, you came into the chamber and tabled documents because it got too hot. You stand exposed in those documents. You know what the consequences of that are: further parliamentary scrutiny and further public scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On this occasion, you are trying to avoid that. Forget the fact that you have established a precedent in relation to your modus operandi with the Wrights; forget all that. On this occasion, you are basically saying, `I am not going to front up with the information that the opposition and the parliament want.' Minister, I think you are, as they say, a `petardist'. You are hoist on your own petard.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I oppose this motion moved by Senator Faulkner for a number of reasons, not the least of which is, in the first instance, that no case has been made that I have misled the Senate. No-one has produced any words that I have used in the Senate that have misled the Senate, to the best of my knowledge, at all. I will come to that and go back over those matters in detail, lest there is anybody who has not been focusing on some of the questions that have been asked and the answers that have been given.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But equally importantly, returns to order are a mechanism for the Senate to use in circumstances where they believe that information should be provided to the Senate. Presumably, that is because there is an important matter where you call upon taking from a minister and a department information that would otherwise not be publicly available, that is not on the public record. There have been occasions, of course&mdash;and there always will be&mdash;where returns to order should be used. I make no bones about that whatsoever. But in circumstances where no case has been made that a senator has misled the Senate, then I do not think it is an appropriate case to use a return to order.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, I follow on and indicate that the breadth of the return to order does not go simply to the question of whether I have misled the Senate; it goes to the much broader fishing expedition in relation to any advice to me from my department relating to unemployment projections up to the year 2000. That is any advice whatsoever&mdash;not advice pertaining to the, I say, fabricated allegation that I have misled the Senate, but any advice whatsoever and my statements about the purported <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> unachievability of the Australian Labor Party's target of five per cent unemployment by the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say, firstly, a return to order is an important mechanism for use by the Senate when it believes that documents that otherwise would not be provided publicly should be. Secondly, because that mechanism is so important, if you want to use it because you think someone has misled the Senate then you have to make a decent case that in fact they have. Thirdly, when you do want to use it, you do need to have some discretion in the focusing of the return to order to ensure that you are not trying to debase the value of returns to order by casting your net so wide that you consistently get refusals from a government. That is, the terms of the proposed return to order should be targeted to the matters in question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, a return to order should be used, if all of those other conditions are satisfied, in circumstances where there has been an unwillingness to front up and give an answer. In that respect I would say, `Look, with respect to this matter, I have answered this in the Senate on a number of occasions yesterday and again today.' Also, I have been written to by the secretary of the estimates committee which is meeting on Friday&mdash;and it is early days in the week, I know, but Friday is not that far away&mdash;indicating that the committee may wish to discuss these matters then, and I am happy to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In those circumstances, to proceed with a return to order would cast an enormously wide net across any information provided on unemployment projections&mdash;and how do you do a projection? You take into account certain assumptions about a whole lot of economic matters and you necessarily therefore are asking for a lot more than that because you want to see what is behind assumptions that have been made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So let me come to the case of whether I have, in fact, misled on this matter. I have dealt with this matter once before, yesterday, and I have dealt with it today. But since members opposite do not seem to have come to grips with what I have said, and perhaps some people now in the chamber were not <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4674"> here during question time, let me go through these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 18 August I put out a press release entitled `Labor's hidden unemployed to slow fall in jobless rate'. One sentence at the bottom of that press release said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similarly, DEETYA has advised that at the time of the election, on information available to the previous government, unemployment in 2000 would have been between 6.8 and 7.3 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>Let me read that to you to convey its meaning:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similarly, DEETYA has advised&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is us&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that at the time of the election&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, its advice as to what information was around at the time of the election, and this information would have been available to the previous government. I said in the Senate, not today but yesterday, that, if they chose to ask for this information, they could have got it themselves; that is, it was information that was available to the government. If you have a whole department there, all you have to do is ask for it. The press release continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . unemployment in the year 2000 would have been between 6.8 and 7.3 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what that sentence means. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similarly, DEETYA has advised that at the time of the election, on information available to the previous government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>they were in government for 13 years; they had every piece of information available to them that it was possible for the department to provide&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">unemployment in 2000 would have been between 6.8 and 7.3 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>A journalist in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> , not having done an interview with me&mdash;and that is fair enough; people are entitled to rely on your release&mdash;paraphrased that. He did not quote it. He obviously did not directly quote it. He paraphrased it and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Vanstone said that at the time of the March election, her department had advised Mr Crean, the then employment minister, that unemployment by the year 2000 would have been, at best, 6.8 per cent.</PARA>

It is what a journalist in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  has paraphrased from a press release.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then the opposition seeks to rely further, for some reason inexplicable to me, on a transcript of an interview done with <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meet the Press</EMPHASIS> a few days later. It has already been raised in here by nearby Senator Faulkner. What I would like to tell you is this. The transcript states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Labor knew before the election that its target of 5 per cent unemployment by the year 2000 was unachievable; it had been told that. I know that's absolutely certain that they knew.</PARA>
<PARA>Nonetheless, they kept pretending that they could perhaps get to a target. That says they were told, and I repeated in here&mdash;and I am happy to do it again if that is what people prefer&mdash;the range of people who did tell them they would not get to that target. If we have <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4675"> got to the stage where a minister cannot say, `Look, you knew you were not going to get there and you were told'&mdash;when, in fact, they were told and they did know&mdash;where are we?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The press release is on the public record. I have no embarrassment about that press release. I am quite happy with it. If my job is going to be to correct what has been said every time a journalist gets something wrong or members on the other side get something wrong, I am never going to do any work. I stand by what I said in that press release&mdash;quite happily. I stand by what I said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meet the Press</EMPHASIS> program.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I was saying, I have also explained my comment that the previous government had been told that its five per cent target could not be achieved.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not said they were told by the department. That is what I have not said. That is probably the crux of the matter in the end.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have referred to the comment on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meet the Press</EMPHASIS> that they were told&mdash;and I have repeated this for almost a third time in this place&mdash;the sorts of people who told them. There is really nothing in this suggestion that I have misled or that my department has somehow suggested in advice to me that I misled. Make no bones about it&mdash;the department rightly <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4676"> points out that the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> is correct. That is not an article written by me and it is not an article done from an interview with me; it is an article done by a journalist paraphrasing a press release. The department's advice to me simply drew attention to the inaccuracy of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to the second ground. Senator Faulkner seems to be seeking every piece of analysis and advice concerning scenarios, projections, forecasts, et cetera about unemployment. No government is going to simply give out all of this to satisfy the senator's curiosity and fishing expedition. The Public Service has to be able to provide dispassionate and fearless analysis and advice. This cannot happen if anything can be put in the public domain at a senator's whim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The return to order process was not created as a licence to fish. It was not created as a device to give automatic access, least of all for no good reason, to internal information in government. The previous government itself declined to provide information when it was judged not to be in the public interest. It is not in the public interest to undermine the institution of frank analysis and advice. That is especially so when aspects of the information, as with economic projections, can be market sensitive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That brings me to the third reason for opposing the motion. I would not lightly invoke market sensitivity and public interest as reasons for declining to provide material to the Senate. We should be careful and look at issues of market sensitivity case by case. This should not be invoked as some unthinking or blanket reason for denying information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senators who have an interest in the estimates committees will have heard on numerous occasions the attacks I have made on claims that have been used by departments over the years about market confidentiality. The ABC's frequent use of that comes to mind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At a later stage, I might raise some opportunities the previous government used to get around the Senate estimates committees which were finally making departments come to grips with the fact that the departments could not be allowed to escape scrutiny at estimates <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> committees by sticking market confidentiality clauses in. They devised a very sneaky way of getting around that, but I will come to that on another day. It does not warrant any more than a mere mention here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some aspects of the advice to me from the department which, in the view of the Treasurer's office&mdash;and I accept that&mdash;must be market sensitive. The Senate, I hope, would appreciate that work on scenarios for unemployment involves comments about possible future rates of economic growth and that this can carry implications beyond any debate here about employment or about whether the Senate has been misled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am perfectly happy to be as forthcoming as possible with the Senate committee which reconvenes on Friday and discuss these matters. There is no urgency about this today. I am happy to go on answering questions about why I have not misled the Senate. I am happy to repeat in this place time and time again the number of people who told the previous government that it was not going to reach its five per cent unemployment target by the year 2000. I am very happy to continue to do that. If people want to continue raising these matters day after day, they can bring in here again the press release I issued and the article written in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know if I have said this in the Senate already&mdash;I may have&mdash;but in case I have not I will say it now. I do not attribute any bad faith to the journalist. People make mistakes; I understand that. People do read things differently; I understand that. I do not attribute any bad faith to him at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, nonetheless, an incorrect impression was created. In other words, the impression was created that I have said something that I have not said. I am perfectly happy to keep reanswering that matter in here, but we have to stick to the issue here&mdash;that is, because Senator Faulkner wants to maintain that I have misled the Senate and has not yet, in my view, made out an appropriate case, it does not entitle him to go on a fishing expedition for the full range of advice on unemployment projections up to the year 2000 which this government may or may not have received.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4677">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand arguments that we have projections in the budgets. I am not making a case here that there are not ever forecasts, that there are not ever projections and that scenarios are never cast. I am not making that case at all. Of course these things are done. But a government goes through all that advice, weighs it up and accepts that which it thinks is the best advice. What Senator Faulkner is asking for is the full range of that. If you do it here, then why not do it next week to Senator Kemp on Treasury matters? Why not ask for everything there?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Kernot interjects. I hope she was listening in the early part of my remarks when I said that I do understand why there is a return to order and that I do think there are circumstances when it is appropriate to use it. I used it myself. To the best of my recollection I have used it only once, and certainly only once recently. That was when the previous government refused to be forthcoming with respect to the payment of Dr Lawrence's fees. That was a very important issue, and we believed it was important enough to use a return to order. Perhaps the Foreign Investment Review Board was one. I do not know; I was not involved in that. There are those circumstances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All I am saying is that use of a return to order is important. Use of a very broad one necessarily becomes even more important. In order to use it you have to make a really decent case. What I said on the record is there for all to see: a press release that says one thing and an article the next day written by a journalist who has not spoken to me. It was written with no bad faith as far as I am concerned, although I suppose I should not say that without having met him to discuss it. I am giving him the benefit of what perhaps should be doubt, but it has never entered my head that this was done in bad faith; put it that way. The journalist has misparaphrased that. The journalist has not put it in quotes; he has misparaphrased it. The department has written to me and said, `There's a mistake in the media.'</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope my department does not do that every time that happens and expect me to come and correct it in the chamber or somewhere else, because I will spend my life in here. I suspect the reason the department did it on this occasion is that the incorrect paraphrasing actually refers to an activity of theirs: that is, whether they directly advised the previous minister. I think that is the circumstance that occasioned them to do this. They certainly did not do it in other circumstances when there has been incorrect reporting&mdash;for example, in higher education, which we will discuss on another day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, let me conclude by saying that I agree&mdash;there is no dispute&mdash;that returns to order are important. They are a very important mechanism. The currency can be devalued by overuse and the currency can be devalued by poor drafting when you use a baseball bat or a sledgehammer to hit a nail. But, when the nail is not even there&mdash;when the relevant documents are on the public record in the sense that the statement I made is a public press release, when the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> is on the public record, when what I said on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meet the Press</EMPHASIS> is on the public record; and I think they speak for themselves&mdash;there is no case for using a return to order as broad as this to go right into every possible projection that the government might have made with respect to these matters. You need to have a case; otherwise what we are saying is, `Any time we feel like it, for no good reason, we think we'll just ask the government to open up its books on everything.' That is not the purpose of a return to order.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lastly, before I conclude&mdash;because I will try to keep very close to the time that Senator Faulkner used&mdash;Senator Faulkner raised yet again the Wright family, the so&hyphen;called Wright family. I will not bother going into everything he said. It seems that as much as I come into this place and acknowledge that the department made a mistake and that they have apologised&mdash;and although I wrote to the estimates committee, having asked for the draft of the letter to the estimates committee to be changed, having got some advice, and although I asked that the letter be sent around to the committee so that all members got it, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4678"> including, obviously, Labor members and presumably, therefore, Senator Natasha Stott Despoja as well&mdash;somehow this is a ruse and a cover&hyphen;up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very important to remember something that was raised in question time today. I accept that this is not pertinent to the detail of this return to order, but it is pertinent to the remarks that Senator Faulkner made, since he is alleging I have some sort of record in this respect and is using the Wright family as an example of it. There were two things wrong with the Wright family. Firstly, the Wright family was presented as being an actual family, when what in fact happened was that an actual example of a family that had been caught by the means test was taken and altered. In my view it is not reasonable to then call it an actual family. That is fair enough. That has been acknowledged. Secondly, errors of calculation were made in the level of social security benefits that that family could get.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we should not forget that the Wright family example illustrates a very real problem. The problem is that relatively wealthy families were applying for Austudy&mdash;families which might also have available to them social security or other government benefits. Other departments do not have an actual means test. If anything, the case of the so&hyphen;called Wright family demonstrates the merit of Labor's means test. Nobody disputes that a family with the Wrights' profile would have available to them around $12,000 worth of benefits other than Austudy. I have tabled in the Senate real cases of wealthy families denied Austudy by the application of the means test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been extensive consideration over the life of this government of the desirability of extending the means test. There have been no rash decisions about an immediate application of the means test to other benefits, because no&hyphen;one wants to disadvantage the genuinely needy. But let me reassure the Senate that we will be targeting the greedy, just as Labor did by applying the means test to Austudy. It was designed to get at people like the so&hyphen;called Wrights, who, taking Senator Ray's advice, as I am advised, did have a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> home worth over $1 million and who would, but for the means test, have got Austudy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just raise those points to indicate that the error with respect to the so&hyphen;called Wright family is that they started with an actual family and changed it. It is not reasonable to call it an actual family after that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Initially, there was an error in the calculations. I think the calculations put it up at $20,000, and we say it is around $12,000, but the guts of it&mdash;that a family with the profile would, but for the means test, be able to get those benefits&mdash;is not incorrect. As an example of how it works, it is a good example. It is only one example, and that was the error that was there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me conclude by saying returns to order are important. They should be used for very important matters. They should not be more broadly cast than they need be. They certainly should not be used when the question of whether someone has misled the Senate has already been answered. They should not be used for a fishing expedition and there is certainly no case to use them when the estimates committee before which I am to appear on Friday has not even had the opportunity to answer and was told at the last sitting, when I was overseas on education matters, that I would be coming back. There is absolutely no reason, for all of those reasons, to proceed with this return to order.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that the advice is pertinent. It has been used and is being used.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not regard that as general fishing. I do think that the information the Democrats got on a return to order which Senator Hill complied with ultimately on Hinchinbrook gave us material that was so useful in the estimates process that I do not think it is sufficient to argue, `If you wait until Friday, you get another go at it.'

I think the issue of employment projections is an important one. On page 119 of Budget Paper No. 1 we have projections. On the page after that we have assumptions, four years out. It is no big deal. Treasury is worried about us doing this but it is no big deal in the budget, as long as you spell out the assumptions. At page 227 we have the actual forecasts and yes, of course, they are only one year out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the wider question of the debate we can have on projections and forecasts, what that means for unemployment policy and what advice is being given to you by the department is a relevant matter for the Senate to discuss. I am not focusing on it, as I said earlier, from the point of view of the major emphasis being on misleading the Senate, but I do note that in your answer to Senator Carr on 23 September at the estimates committee you said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the government asked for advice on basically, if I can put it this way, `What would you have to do to get unemployment to five per cent?' That advice was offered.</PARA>

Let me make it perfectly clear that I do not see this as a witch-hunt on Senator Vanstone. Senator Vanstone has explained the situation to the Senate, and I believe to the satisfaction generally of the Senate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That there will be laid on the table, by 5 pm on Tuesday, 29 October 1996, by the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone), copies of any advice to her from her department relating to unemployment projections up to the year 2000 and her statements about the purported unachievability of the Australian Labor Party's target of 5 per cent unemployment by the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that this matter of unemployment is one of the most important policy considerations that are facing every individual member of the parliament and the people in general&mdash;not only the government but also individual members of parliament.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> I take on board what Senator Vanstone said about these possibly including advices re ceived from Treasury. But as Senator Kernot pointed out, and as most would have observed, the budget papers themselves have employment projections and unemployment projections. The budget papers themselves have the assumptions upon which those projections have been made. It is very important to have as much information as possible about that question of employment. The government itself has established a cabinet committee on employment.</PARA>

Let us be in a position to hear what advices have been given to the government in respect of this matter, and also the assumptions that are made. Some of the assumptions have to be queried. Once you query those assumptions, you then place the government and others in a position of considering whether or not the policies that are adopted will achieve the desirability of reducing unemployment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem of unemployment, simply stated, is that there are more people in or seeking paid work than there are jobs available at the same time as technological change and automation are slashing jobs that used to be about, particularly for the unskilled. We have to look at the situation very carefully. If we look at the assumptions, we have to look at what those assumptions are. We ought to be looking at those in paid work at present for whom it would be a great desire to be out of that paid work and doing something else and performing other tasks and jobs which they want to perform, which are socially creative,</PARA>

<PARA>The House has passed that resolution to invite Mr Clinton to address it. It now invites us to do likewise and to accept that the form of the meeting take place as per the resolution of the House. This is the form, as I recall it, that was adopted by the Senate in relation to the time when then President Bush of the United States addressed both houses of this parliament. That was, I think, a very successful occasion and reinforced the very close, longstanding and important links between Australia and the United States of America. We therefore strongly support an invitation being <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> extended to the United States President, while he is visiting Australia, to address the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only issue of some controversy is where such an address should take place&mdash;whether it should be in the House, in the Senate or on neutral ground such as the Great Hall&mdash;and what rules should apply. We wrestled with this, I recall, at the time of the debate in relation to President Bush. As I recall, some were somewhat uncomfortable with the notion that the Senate move into the House of Representatives for this purpose. Nevertheless, as that worked successfully&mdash;the meeting has to take place somewhere&mdash;and as the House comes to this place for the opening of parliament as set down in the constitution, upon reflection we think it is not a bad balance of power in all the circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not the argument I recall putting on the previous occasion, but we all learn from our experiences in such circumstances. As that worked well&mdash;the rules that applied on the last occasion would apply on this occasion&mdash;it seems that this is a process we should adopt again on this second occasion. I therefore urge the Senate to approve the motion in order that this invitation might be issued, and that we join together in the House of Representatives to hear the address of the United States' President.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I don't agree. I go along with the previous position of the then opposition parties, the now government, that this is not the right thing to do. The President of the Senate expressed a view a little earlier, a week or two ago, that it would be better if the address by the President of the United States were to be held in the Great Hall. I cannot help but agree with that point of view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we look at the direction in which we are heading with this particular motion, we see that we are discriminating towards one head of state against every other head of state on the face of the planet. If we are going to invite the President of the United States to address both houses in the House of Representatives, why, for goodness sake, not the head of state of Greece? Why not the President of India? Why not the Prime Minister of New Zealand, who comes to Australia on an average of every other year, if not every year?</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QD4">Senator BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Why not the head of state of Canada or Japan or South Africa or Argentina? I submit that there are some extremely good reasons for putting at least some of those heads of state in the queue ahead of the President of the United States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have, for example, a very large expatriate Greek community in this country, far bigger than that of the United States. It would seem, if we were to be logical about taking <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> into account the public interest here in Australia, that the Prime Minister of Greece would be at least as creditable a head of state as the President of the United States of America in addressing a joint sitting of parliament in the House of Representatives. Let alone the fact that just a couple of weeks ago the head of the Tibetan people, the Dalai Lama, was in Parliament House but did not even get a look in at either the Senate or the House of Representatives. His presence was not even accorded recognition. So there are dual standards afoot here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are setting a wrong precedent. Somebody a moment ago interjected what about our head of state? Many Australians would not know that Her Majesty cannot go into the House of Representatives, nor can the Governor-General, because we abide by some out&hyphen;of&hyphen;date English tradition. If this motion carries we will have this absurd situation where a president of a foreign country will address the parliament in the House of Representatives but our own head of state cannot even do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not a monarchist but I point to the fact that we have a tradition, which is an ancient one but which at least has some democratic impulse behind it, but we have allowed willy&hyphen;nilly this idea that only the President of the United States should address the parliamentarians of Australia in the House of Representatives&mdash;nobody else on earth. I think we should nip that tradition in the bud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a mistake for President Bush to so address the parliament in the House of Representatives in 1992. It is one we ought not be compounding. At the very least we ought to set out a policy which applies to all visiting heads of state to our country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we have the President of the United States addressing us in the house of government, why not those other heads of state? It is an institutionalised piece of discrimination that we are headed towards here, and one cannot help but think that there is some obsequiousness involved in it towards the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose it is a slip or a glitch that we are being asked to vote on a motion which reads:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> That the Senate:</PARA>

<PARA>Is the President of the United States going to fix the time that he is going to address us and notify us all? I know, of course, that what is meant there is that the time is to be fixed by the President of the Senate, but it is a very Freudian slip that has occurred here. It reminds me of the time that Robin Gray, the then Premier of Tasmania, decided to recall parliament to determine a matter of having a giant pulp mill on the farmlands of Wesley Vale but allowed North Broken Hill, the woodchip company, to announce it through dint of their own press release on their letterhead and to transfer to them the business of fixing when parliament should return.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think we should do other than welcome any head of state to this country, and that applies to the President, but he should be addressing us elsewhere. It ought to be in the Great Hall. If that is good enough for other heads of state, it is good enough for him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By the way&mdash;we cannot believe all we read in the press&mdash;it may not be that President Clinton is anything but caretaker President when he comes. I read in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> in the regular column by Phillip Adams on the weekend the attributes of Ralph Nader as presidential candidate. While Phillip Adams omitted to say so, Ralph Nader is the US Green Party candidate for the presidency. He has been frightening the daylights out of the White House until recent polls gave President Clinton such a big lead over presidential contender Dole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It may be that we will have the first US Green President in President Nader next time.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats have no objection to listening to President Clinton. In fact, when President Bush was here, the Democrats did not come back to Canberra. Both houses were recalled and we did not come because we thought it was a waste of money. But we will be sitting the week when President Clinton is here. We have no objection to listening to President Clinton. In fact, when President Bush was out here, I did go and listen to him when he spoke in Sydney, I might add. But that is not a consideration with this one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The consideration with this one is the other consideration we had the last time a similar motion was moved, and that is that it is being held in the House of Representatives. When <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4686"> it was confirmed this would happen at a whips meeting&mdash;it was actually a joke&mdash;I said I was going to move a motion that, if President Clinton spoke to us, every head of state should speak to us in the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not actually think every head of state ought to be addressing us in a joint meeting in the House of Representatives, but I do believe that this is a very bad precedent to make. I note that Senator Hill, when he spoke last time on the Bush motion, said that it was just not appropriate and that this should definitely not be considered to be a precedent. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this is very much a one-off situation. It is not the normal practice in this country. We have adopted the practice of giving a foreign dignitary who is here as a guest of the government the opportunity to address parliamentarians elsewhere in the building&mdash;usually at a ceremonial dinner in the Great Hall.</PARA>
<PARA>That is true, and that is what we have done, except, of course, in the one case of President Bush.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not even our own head of state has addressed a joint meeting of both houses of this parliament in the House of Representatives. In fact, the only time she is entitled to address a joint meeting of both houses of this parliament in the Senate is when she is giving a speech which has been written by the government&mdash;by the executive of Australia. If she is giving a speech which has been written by herself&mdash;which she has done in this place&mdash;it has been given in the Great Hall, and that is quite appropriate. I see no reason why any other head of state should assume a higher status in the parliament of Australia&mdash;in this parliament building&mdash;than our own head of state, which is exactly what we are conferring when we agree to this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will agree with this motion in the end. I do not believe every head of state should automatically be able to address both houses of this parliament in the House of Representatives or in the Senate&mdash;in either house of this parliament. But I do believe that we are now setting this precedent. Obviously we are, even though we did not set the precedent last time, Senator Hill. We are setting it this time, are we not? Yes, because this is twice in a row <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> now, but only with the American President. If we are setting this precedent, and this motion does go through&mdash;as it obviously will&mdash;the next time our own head of state comes to Australia, I will move that she be allowed to address us in the House of Representatives in a joint meeting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am going to move that&mdash;and I never make a threat that I do not carry out, as you know, Senator Hill, not that that would be a threat, of course&mdash;and I would expect that that will be agreed to. I think it is really quite outrageous that a head of state is accorded a higher status than our own head of state. I am going to do that. I think Senator Brown has a good point when he says&mdash;as I have said many times in the past, and I did say it when President Bush came out here, and Senator Lees said it on the record&mdash;that we have to consider where we draw the line and where we start offending people because we are not inviting heads of state to address us in one of the houses of this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that is a very, very serious matter that we have to consider now, because there are going to be other heads of state visiting after this. There are going to be heads of state of countries with which we do have very, very close relations, with which we have special defence treaties, as we do with the US, and with which we have other relations. Those people will be visiting this country and they ought to be given special consideration as well. We cannot just do this with one head of state&mdash;not even our own. When this motion is passed and sets the precedent, that is exactly what we are doing, so just keep that in mind.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On what basis do you do it? Do you say this is because we are very friendly with the United States? Australia is very friendly with a number of other nations. Perhaps there are a number of other nations with which Australia has a closer alliance. Is it because the United States is very big? There are other countries which are bigger in terms of their economic power. Perhaps after a while we will be able to change the ratings and, if there is another country which has more economic power, we can change the rating and that head of state will be given special consideration. Or perhaps we can nudge out the United States and put the other country in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps it is not economic power at all. Perhaps it is because the United States is an English speaking buddy of Australia. Perhaps this is it. We have not actually heard what the rationale is for singling out the United States as different from any other nation in the world. I agree with the speakers today who have said that it is a very silly precedent, if it is a precedent. I would like to think it is not a precedent just because it has happened twice.

That is set out in the standing orders whereby the Governor-General at a particular occasion instructs the Usher of the Black Rod to go to the House of Representatives and ask the members of the House of Representatives to come into this chamber. I do invite honourable senators to consider that matter very carefully&mdash;as to what we are doing here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that it occurred for President Bush, but that cannot be pointed to as a precedent, not only for the reason that I have just given&mdash;that is the most important&mdash;but also for any other reason, because that happened as a result of the Prime Minister of Australia addressing the United States Congress and this was a sort of reciprocal arrangement. That was no excuse of course, but it cannot be regarded as a precedent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also invite honourable senators to show me in the standing orders or indeed in the constitution where we are given the authority to sit elsewhere than in this chamber. The authority for us to sit anywhere but in this chamber is not there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Inferentially, it is clear from the standing orders that the sittings of the Senate are to take place in the Senate chamber. If you have a look at the provisions in the standing orders which relate to the description of who shall sit in what seats, it is clearly inferred that the sittings of the Senate take place in this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4688"> You might say, `What if the chamber burnt down? Does that mean the Senate can't sit?' Of course, that is an emergency situation and no doubt there would be a convening of the Senate for the purposes of sitting elsewhere, but that clearly is an emergency situation which is not envisaged here. We are not facing an emergency situation; it is an invita tion that has been issued to the President of the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Honourable senators should think about this a bit further and see what it is doing to this chamber. We in this chamber have not been consulted about this. We read it in the newspaper. Not only were we not consulted in this Senate chamber but also no committee of this chamber was consulted. The Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade was not consulted. The Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, of which I am a member, was not consulted about this. This is not an initiative of the parliament. This was an announcement by the executive government and we are expected to kowtow and follow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not mean any disrespect to the head of state of a friendly country at all, but I am raising some matters which really should be considered having regard to the constitution and having regard to the standing orders of the Senate and the integrity of the parliament. I would like to see this whole matter&mdash;and I am not going to move it now&mdash;at some stage referred to one of our committees for consideration and report. Whether that be the Procedures Committee or not, we do have to consider these matters carefully in future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously, to reject the proposal that has been put forward by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Hill) would be regarded, to say the least, as discourteous. So we are in an invidious position. I do invite senators to consider this question very seriously. I am not going to proceed with the other point I was going to make because I think these matters have been canvassed sufficiently.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA>The wine industry is one of Australia's success stories. It produces annually about 450 million litres from 600,000 to 700,000 tonnes of wine grapes. It also is a major contributor to tourism and a big employer. Visiting wineries, of which there are approximately 900 dotted around Australia, is one of the most popular pastimes in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The wine industry holds about 97 per cent of the Australian market. The real success story in the industry, however, is its export performance. Exports now account for over 28 per cent of production, and the industry has set itself a target of $1 billion of export sales by the year 2003. This is from a country that is regarded as one of the world's smaller wine producers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The growth in the Australian wineries in the last five years has been rapid, with the then seven publicly listed wine companies recording a net increase in profits. That has been very good for those wine companies. A large part of this is the twentyfold growth in the exports over the last 10 years. There has been increased vineyard planting of premium grape varieties, especially in New South Wales and Victoria, in the cold country. I was out on Saturday actually visiting wineries in the Young area, for example. It is absolutely amazing what is happening in the industry. Between the years of 1993 and 1995 there has been an additional 11,000 hectares of grapes planted&mdash;worth nearly $400 million. It is an industry that has seized the export opportunities available, and I applaud it for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4691"> However, while the industry is enjoying boom times at the present, the current eupho ria will not last unless the industry is managed appropriately. Much of the success of the wine industry must go to the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation, and this annual report sets out clearly its functions and objectives. The report also outlines the structure of its various committees, including the Australian Wine Export Council, which plans and recommends and executes export marketing programs; the Geographical Indications Committee, which plays a valuable role in defining the names and boundaries of Australia's geographical regions; and the label integrity program, which, in essence, ensures truth in labelling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently, the AWBC had a change in chairmanship, with John Pendrigh completing an eight-year involvement with the board as both the deputy chairman and the chairman. I would like to place on the Senate's record my appreciation for the job that he has done in that role over the years. As parliamentary secretary responsible for the wine industry, it has been a great joy to have dealt with him in his term as chairman.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dr John Keniry was appointed on 21 August, and I am confident that he will provide outstanding leadership to the board and to the wine industry in the future. Dr Keniry was formerly Chairman of the Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation. He brings to his new position a wealth of corporate administrative experience, which I am quite sure will assist and help the wine industry in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The wine industry is an exciting star of the rural sector, and it deserves the support of all Australians. I must finish by saying that, of course, we have to be competitive on world markets. We have to be competitive because it is such a big employer. It is going to be so important that the industrial relations legislation is passed in the Senate. The legislation will be of great assistance when it has gone through to help the wine industry and many other industries in Australia.</PARA></SPEECH>

I am not going to waste a lot of precious time <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the Senate to comment at length on this. However, we have raised before not only the number of reports but also the groups&mdash;for example, treaties&mdash;of documents that have come in on the one day. It makes it absolutely impossible to comment in any depth on anything relating to these matters. For example, we could spend a whole half hour, and a lot more, discussing the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation report. As Senator Brownhill has said, it is a very good report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not going to take up too much time of the Senate, but I want to yet again register my protest about this process. Towards the end of each sitting, we have this great rush of documents, which are grouped department by department and in big numbers, and we have inadequate time to comment on them. I emphasise my concern about the volume of documents that have been tabled here today and are to be discussed in half an hour. Obviously, there is no way that 86 documents could be dealt with in half an hour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I acknowledge and underline the point that the great bulk of these documents are annual reports. They can be dealt with in Senate estimates committees, and I hope that will be done. Nevertheless, it raises questions about whether it is appropriate to limit the tabling of documents to two days during the week and whether there should not be a change in arrangements so that these documents can be dealt with in a better way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I acknowledge that on Thursdays there is much more time put aside for dealing with accumulated documents, but it is unfortunate that the parliament, as a result of this procedure, comes a bad second to the media in terms of capacity to discuss the content of these annual reports. For example, the media has the opportunity of dealing with 86 reports tomorrow if it gets the time. We have no chance of commenting on 86 reports. When there are definite tabling requirements for annual reports of departments and agencies, clearly there is pressure on the Senate to deal with them. We have to make some other suitable arrangements to cope with this peak reporting time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to say to the Senate that I just read a speech by Senator Tierney and one by <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4692"> former Senator Michael Baume, and those speeches were given when their party was in opposition. How things have changed! Now that they are in the government, we do not hear anything like those kinds of speeches from them.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now that they are in government&mdash;lo and behold&mdash;there are 86 documents for us to comment on. If you can work that out, that is about three documents every minute. What a turnaround we have. What a noise we heard when the coalition were in opposition. What are the coalition going to do about it now that they are in government?

<PARA>I visited the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies in Darwin earlier this year. I want to make the Senate aware of what a seminally important institute this is and what a struggle it is for it because of the cutback in the funding going to it at a time when it needs more money to expand to carry out the extraordinarily important job it does of providing a whole range of studies for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite a remarkable institution. It is ensuring that there is a two-way flow of information across the north of Australia and from people all over this country so that not only the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people can be better equipped to take part in the affairs of the modern Australian nation, as it is, but this nation can gain from the enormous storehouse of special information and cultural background which the original people of this country can provide to us.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take this opportunity to say to government senators opposite that this institute deserves adequate funding. This institute has enormous importance not only to the people attending it but to the nation as a whole. The work of this institute is unique. It has gained worldwide prominence and notice. People from elsewhere in the world, including people from the other 300 million indigenous peoples around the world, see this institute as something of a guiding light in terms of the educational facility it provides for those who go there. Yet its funding is being cut. It is being squeezed. The pressure on staff is phenomenal. The disadvantage to students because of the funding cuts is obvious when you are there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge the government to look again at the cut to the funding of this extraordinary important institute. If it cannot do that, I urge government ministers and members to be better acquainted with this institution, to read this report and to visit the institution to see the value that there is in that place for so many students and for the nation as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a travesty that it is being put under the slow squeeze, as it is. It is a travesty that it is being blighted by the pressure being put on staff and students alike. It is a travesty that so many people who want to study at the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies cannot and that the institute is not expanding but is being forced to contract.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The introduction to the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies annual report for 1995-96 mentions two important studies that the institute has been engaged in. One of those studies was into the Aboriginal councils that are incorporated under the federal act set aside for that purpose, which was commissioned by the previous government last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The registrar of those Aboriginal corporations, Mr Bouhaus, has appeared before Senate committees to lay out the difficulties that Aboriginal corporations registered under this particular act have in respect of that question which is so much in the news&mdash;accountability of Aboriginal organisations. It is a fact that many of the organisations that do have financial difficulties funded by ATSIC are organisations that are incorporated under this act of parliament that the report refers to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A point that has been made by a number of Aboriginal leaders previously, and by me, I might add, is that it would have been far more reasonable, prudent and fair of the government to have waited until the report referred to in this document was finalised and presented to the government before it took the totally outrageous action that it did of appointing a special auditor, by ministerial direction, into ATSIC. It was a ministerial direction later found by the Federal Court to be unlawful, a ministerial direction which had the effect of declaring all Aboriginal organisations funded by ATSIC guilty until they were proven innocent. Funding was frozen by that ministerial direction until organisations had been cleared by the special auditor.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a great deal of sensitivity at the moment about the use of the words `racist' and `racism', words that I have rarely used in my 20 years of public life, words that I think are applied far too freely. For example, I do not regard the Prime Minister of Australia (Mr Howard) as a racist, and I do not regard the member for Oxley, Pauline Hanson, as a racist. Sadly ignorant and ill&hyphen;informed she may be, but I have met some real racists in my life and she does not even come close. But it is difficult to look at things like the appointment of the special auditor to ATSIC without accurately applying that term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A comparison has been made by me&mdash;and I do not hesitate to make it&mdash;with another auditor's report which is in this parliament, that is, the report of the federal Auditor&hyphen;General on the diesel fuel rebate scheme, which found rorts in that scheme.</PARA>

But, as I said at the time, did anyone seriously suggest&mdash;I would not have&mdash;that a responsible act of the government would have been to have appointed a special auditor to the diesel fuel rebate scheme, to have frozen all payments under that scheme to farmers and miners across Australia, and to have declared all recipients of the scheme guilty until proven by the special auditor to be innocent?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak briefly on the annual report of the Australian Film Finance Corporation. I recall that one of the very first meetings I had when I became a senator was with the then Director of the Film Finance Corporation&mdash;I think it was John Morris. At that time, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Strictly Ballroom</EMPHASIS>  was the big feature and was leading a revival of Australian films on the international scene. We have always known that we were able to produce great films but we have seen over the years the impact that they may have had on the international scene rise and fall. It was in 1994 that I had those discussions with the Film Finance Corporation about the future of the film industry. I did so because the industry has always been an area of keen interest to me, not that I have always had the opportunity to put as much time into it as I would have liked in the past.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things I recall arising out of those discussions was the enthusiasm of people in the corporation&mdash;and I also met with Australian Film Commission&mdash;for the future of the industry.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other important thing is that the system of government and industry support through the Film Finance Corporation is one that is now generally acknowledged as being very successful and contrasts with some of the earlier efforts that governments made&mdash;I do not single out one side or the other here&mdash;in terms of using the taxation system to try to inject finance into filmmaking in this country. Whilst providing 150 per cent tax deductibility for filmmaking in this country was an <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> enthusiastic initiative at the time, we saw that it really did not work in terms of producing good quality films.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> notes, with sadness, the death on 24 October 1996 of Sir Roland Wilson KBE, Kt, CBE, Bachelor of Commerce, Doctor of Philosophy (Oxford), Doctor of Philosophy (Chicago), Hon LLD (Tas), Hon FASSA;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> acknowledges with deep gratitude Sir Roland's magnificent contribution to Australia in peace and war in a wide range of capacities throughout a distinguished career of unsurpassed public service, including as Commonwealth Statistician, in the establishment of the Commonwealth Department of Labour and National Service, and as Secretary to the Commonwealth Treasury, Chairman of Qantas and Chairman of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> expresses its sympathy to his wife, Joyce, at Sir Roland's passing.</PARA>
<PARA>The motion contains several of the bare facts of Sir Roland's career. There are many more. In particular, he was the first Tasmanian from a government school to be a Rhodes scholar. He was in his day one of Australia's foremost economists with great strength in economic statistics. He was the first economist to head the federal Treasury. He was a man of many parts. He was skilled in engineering and in cabinet making. In both these fields he had some notable achievements.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4696">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am indebted to John Farquharson's excellent obituary in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> last Sunday which said that during the war years Sir Roland would fossick in Canberra's rubbish dump to salvage material from which he built an electric motor car to defeat petrol rationing. In his youth he had success as a pole vaulter because `he had designed and built his own lightweight Oregon vaulting stick which was much lighter than the orthodox variety and was tailored to his five-foot height and nine-stone weight'. That is not entirely correct. Sir Roland was more than five foot tall, though perhaps not a lot more. He was small in physical stature but he was a giant in intellect and in the respect that he commanded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said in his statement of tribute last week:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sir Roland Wilson was an important member of a unique group of public servants who helped to transform Australia into a modern industrial economy after the Second World War.</PARA>
<PARA>The group was unique. Although there were more than seven, those who were perhaps best known were the so-called `seven dwarfs'&mdash;Roland Wilson, Dick Randall, Allen Brown, Harry Bland, `Nugget' Coombes, John Crawford and Frederick Shedden. Between them they wielded enormous influence on the direction of postwar Australia right through to the 1960s and, in some instances, into the early 1970s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was my privilege to have known Sir Roland Wilson. He was the Secretary to the Treasury when I joined that department in September 1963. I had the opportunity to work closely in his presence in the following three years before his retirement from the Treasury in 1966. I acted as his personal assistant on more than one occasion. I had almost daily contact with him whilst I was private secretary to the then Treasurer, Harold Holt, from late 1964 to early 1966. In these capacities we travelled to numerous international conferences around the world and, of course, saw each other, particularly in the domestic scene here in Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Never on any one occasion was Roland Wilson other than the complete professional public servant. His relationship with the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> governments he served was correct at all times. He gave advice objectively and fearlessly. His stewardship of the Treasury was impeccable. It was almost certainly during his period as secretary that the Treasury enjoyed its greatest pre&hyphen;eminence. The benefits to Australia were great.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Roland Wilson had a sharp tongue and a sharp pen. I can attest to the accuracy of John Farquharson's statement in his obituary where he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Colleagues of the day have told of the submission from a senior (and long-winded) Treasury official that went to him&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, to Wilson&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">with a conclusion, "It is recommended the grant be authorised." Wilson altered it, in his precise handwriting,&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and it was very precise&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to read "be not authorised," and added, "Recommendation approved as amended." To another paper ending, "The complexities make it difficult to frame a recommendation" he added just two words, "Try harder".</PARA>
<PARA>I saw some of the most powerful and influential figures in the land stand in awe of Roland Wilson&mdash;and, in many instances, fear&mdash;but in all cases with respect. At the same time, Sir Roland Wilson had a razor sharp wit to match his razor sharp intellect. I often felt that he was a shy man. Once you got behind the steely glance and the sharp tongue, a heart of gold was often clear to see.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The world has changed a great deal since the days of Sir Roland's illustrious career. So has the Public Service. We may not see the likes of Roland Wilson again. Most Australians would probably not remember or even have heard of Sir Roland Wilson because of the great age to which he lived. It is very important, however, that we not lose sight of the values that he epitomised&mdash;character, intellect, honesty, integrity, objective and fearless advice to government and, through all of that, dedicated service to the Australian people.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the adjournment tonight with respect to public <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4697"> education. Last week I attended the opening ceremony of the combined campus of Nicholls Primary School and the Holy Spirit Primary School, the former being an ACT government funded school and the latter being a Catholic school. A combined campus such as this may not be new in some other states but it is here in the ACT. This combined campus was an initiative by Labor when they held government in the ACT.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The experience shared by all the invited guests at the opening ceremony&mdash;by the parents and politicians alike&mdash;is something worthy of conveyance to this chamber. It is worthy because it served to reinforce in my mind what I am doing here and why many of us are in fact here. All of the children from both campuses participated in the ceremony. They were welcomed by Principal Woolacott from Nicholls, Father Bernie blessed the congregation and we were joined by the Ngunnawal elders, who ratified the school's use of the land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The themes the school adopted were `belonging', `friendship', `we are one', `tolerance', `sharing' and `learning without boundaries or barriers'. Each child had made an exquisite banner, while the walls of the hall were covered with bright murals of outstretched welcoming hands. The choir opened up with the national anthem and throughout the ceremony sang songs of peace and sharing. Their performance concluded with the song <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">We are one</EMPHASIS>, which to me symbolised many things of value.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The future of our children must be foremost in our minds&mdash;their health, education, security and, of course, happiness, their opportunity and their future. We cannot trust these things to the fancies of the market. To do so is to jeopardise the ability and responsibility we have as elected representatives to guarantee the best possible outcomes for our children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The depth of feeling this innocent school ceremony invoked not only in me but in most of those present reinforced in me the importance of government funded education&mdash;of public education. Show me a better investment of taxpayers' money. Show me a better way to ensure that our young people have the best chance of survival in a changing and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> challenging society. Some parents will have the choice between a public and private school. But most will not. Most will have to take what is given. If what is given is not as good as what you can purchase on the market, where does this leave the children? What if you are not earning enough to purchase the higher standard of education?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a dangerous path to tread for any socially democratic society. It will only serve to once again determine access to quality education on socioeconomic grounds. To reduce funding or compromise public education in any way will send us down this path. The Howard government is doing just that. This government will sacrifice the standard of public education to promote private education. They will steal almost $130 million from government schools to fund an expansion of non&hyphen;government schools, providing huge incentives to middle-class parents to leave the state system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But will this expansion benefit children? Until now, new schools were approved after they had met educational and financial standards. These requirements will now be waived. Concerns have already been expressed that many new schools will be fundamentalist or run by narrow sects and interest groups. Now, schools that have been rejected before may, no matter what, get funding from this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an ideologically driven policy based on a misplaced notion of competition and level paying fields. And what about the children left behind? Have we no obligation to them? And what about the future for children in the new private schools? Under Labor we saw an increase in schools funding of 56.7 per cent in real terms. Under Howard we have already seen cuts to higher education of $2 billion, cuts to vocational education, cuts to recurrent grants for government schools&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Under Mr Howard, we have seen cuts to higher education of $2 billion, cuts to vocational education, cuts to recurrent grants for government schools and cuts to capital grants for non&hyphen;government schools. The message from this government to the young people of Australia is not an encouraging one. What subliminal and, in fact, overt effect are we having when all young people hear about is cuts to their education? Is that not a devaluing of their role and their right to learn and then eventually participate in the work force? This is an unacceptable approach.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Holy Spirit Primary School and Nicholls Primary School have jumped many hurdles to get where they are today. Their opening day has become a powerful statement on the value of publicly funded education. The expressions of sharing and reconciliation provide a powerful and pertinent contradiction to some of the narrow and introverted utterances that have attracted media attention recently and, as I have said, have served as a reminder of why we are here. And, if it is not to provide a better place and a better life for the next generation of Australians, then what is it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If every politician who attended the opening at Nicholls felt the same way I did, then a great purpose was served. I only wish that every senator and member of that other place had the same opportunity to experience everything good about public education, the excellent management of resources through a combined campus, and the children's messages, and then, like me, remember whose purpose we are really trying to serve during our time here.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, rise to speak on the subject of education. At the hands of the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) this month, education has already been a sorry affair for Australian children. I am referring in particular to the remarks made by Minister Kemp concerning literacy in our schools. I think these remarks show that the minister has little understanding of the issue and, in my view, they are unhelpful to educators, parents and children alike.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current edition of the independent education magazine <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Education Alternatives</EMPHASIS> has made a scathing attack on the minister under the headlines `Literary hoax'. Hoax indeed! <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the benefit of the Senate, I would like to recap on some of the minister's remarks recently and on how they have been interpreted in the media.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At a meeting in Perth two weeks ago, he told the audience that he had become aware that an extensive body of data relating to literacy had remained unreported. He was referring to the Australian longitudinal surveys of Australian youth program. The minister went on to say on radio:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this information has been sat on for 15 years. None of it was analysed or published. No use was made of the data. My view is that the public has a right to know.</PARA>
<PARA>As if that was not enough, the minister said on Radio National:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Parents have a right to be informed about the progress of their children. If the facts had been released as they could have been . . . then perhaps this problem might have been addressed much more effectively much earlier.</PARA>
<PARA>Parents and educators across the country must have been overwhelmed by the minister's insight. Why did they not think of that! Before I indulge too much in sarcasm, I need to put on record the nature and the objectives of this study that the minister so cleverly uncovered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian longitudinal surveys of Australian youth program is a study of 28,000 year 9 students which began in 1975. The main purpose of this program was to provide a better understanding of the process of young <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people's transition between education, training and work. It is made up of three components which together span a period of 20 years, and it is in fact not due to be published until 1997. I would be quite happy to supply the minister with further details of that program, but I can assure him that there is nothing secret about it. It certainly did not require the minister's intervention to prepare an analysis all of a sudden.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As might be expected, Minister Kemp's revelation that 30 per cent of 14&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds in year 9 had not achieved basic literacy skills made the headlines elsewhere too. `No data on alarming literacy rates' said the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>, `Minister wins support for school literacy push' said the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> and `Cult of secrecy must end', said the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald&hyphen;Sun</EMPHASIS>&mdash;and so on. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS> in Hobart described the situation as `staggering' and, like puppy dogs feeding out of the minister's hands, the paper reported:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The statistics also must make taxpayers wonder what has been happening to their education dollars.</PARA>
<PARA>Enthused by his own rhetoric, the minister announced that $12 billion is already enough to spend on teaching children to read and write. Bingo! Here we have it. The minister is preparing Australians, I believe, for the coalition's real intentions. This government wants to starve our public education system of funds to an even greater degree, I think, than the previous government did. And the minister wants to persuade Australians that the money is being wasted and that there is a conspiracy in schools to conceal this from parents. The minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the moment there is an information black market among parents about school results.</PARA>
<PARA>As I have already pointed out, the study on which the minister bases his shameful pronouncements has not been concealed from parents for 15 years. Furthermore, it will come as some surprise to all the teachers I know, who spend many hours each term preparing extensive written reports and meeting with parents, that they are not only failing to report to parents but they are also hiding the truth. I suggest to the minister that nothing could be further from the truth. This government so often resorts to accusing the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4700"> Democrats of scaremongering, but I ask: what is this if it is not scaremongering?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said earlier that the minister has displayed his ignorance on education. If he were not the minister for schools, he could be forgiven for assuming that literacy problems are, firstly, easy to identify and define and, secondly, easy to remedy. In discovering the study, the minister imagines that he has defined the problem. He then goes on to give us his own version of literacy by defining it with a question: are our children learning to read?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister did not bother himself with detail. It is apparently of no consequence to him that the aspect of literacy on which the study concentrated is comprehension. The researchers of that study, the Australian Council for Educational Research, said that a failure in terms of literacy in this case meant `they have not achieved what is regarded as an 80 per cent satisfactory result on tests of reading comprehension'. Quite another matter, Minister Kemp, from just learning to read. The Australian Council for Educational Research warned in the study that the results were `based on a particular definition of competence and will shift as definitions are modified and as the requirements of society change'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is obvious to educators is that the demands on today's children are quite different from those made when Dr Kemp was at school. In fact, there is a substantial body of opinion which says that literacy standards are increasing. Dr Brian Cambourne, associate professor in education of the Centre for Studies in Literacy at the University of Wollongong says that, rather than a decline in literacy standards, data strongly supports a very different interpretation; namely, that, given the increase in the multicultural mix of students whose first language is not English, our schools and teachers have held the literacy line. If literacy standards were indexed like costs, wages and pensions, it would mean something like a 30 to 40 per cent increase in literacy ability over the last 20 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the minister should do his homework. He should understand that the declining standards theory is a myth. He should also know that literacy is not a simple, easily <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> taught and easily tested mechanical skill. It involves getting together the ability to give meaning to situations, the ability to handle words to serve meaning, and the ability to process words by listening, speaking, reading and writing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whatever problems there are in the literacy skills of our students, they will not be solved by simply forcing schools to timetable English instead of computer classes, physical education, art or any other subject. The problem is not, as the minister suggests, the result of a crowded curriculum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not suggest that there is not a problem in our schools or that they are confined to government schools, but I do suggest that further cuts to funds for our public education system are not going to solve the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Publishing literacy data school by school will do little more than frighten parents into shifting their children from school to school, and no doubt the government would prefer them to be shifted out of government schools and into private schools. Leaving aside the questions of usefulness and equity, the chaos that that approach would cause is reason alone to question the minister's judgment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">About the only useful headline which Dr Kemp's remarks have drawn were in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald&hyphen;Sun</EMPHASIS>. It said, `Gude hits Canberra over literacy cuts.' The Victorian education minister, whose views I often do not share, accused the federal government of extreme hypocrisy when it came to tackling literacy problems. In a stinging attack, the paper said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Gude said, `If Dr Kemp were serious about raising literacy levels he would not have cut $676,000 for early literacy programs from Victoria in this year's budget.'</PARA>
<PARA>What was the minister's response? `At present Australia is spending about $12 billion of taxpayers' money on schools a year and most people in the community would think that that would be more than enough,' he said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the minister did not say at that point and what the previous government has not said is that Australia already has an appallingly low level of spending on education. I suggest that to guarantee the best available education for Australian children is a fundamental obligation of any nation's government. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4701"> The minister should show leadership in this respect and refrain from making pronouncements on subjects on which he apparently has inadequate knowledge.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on the adjournment debate tonight to canvass a number of issues in relation to this government's treatment of race issues. A number of people have commented that the response of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to Pauline Hanson's first speech was racist. I don't think it was. It was not a racist response; it was simply a political response. The Prime Minister was doing what politicians often try to do; that is, have two bob each way. He did not get away with it, but the extraordinary thing is that he still continues to do it on almost a daily basis, as was evidenced just 24 hours ago by his statements on foreign aid.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In recent days, the Prime Minister has re&hyphen;entered the race debate by telling John Laws:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I sympathise fundamentally with Australians who are insulted when they are told that we have a racist bigoted past.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And Australians are told that quite regularly. Our children are taught that. Some of the school curricula go close to teaching children that we have a racist bigoted past.</PARA>
<PARA>That is an extraordinary statement from a Prime Minister who just a short time ago was claiming that the election of his government gave a new birth to free speech in this country. Free speech apparently only lasted a month. I found this statement totally bizarre&mdash;all the more so when you consider it came from a man who has represented the seat of Bennelong in this parliament for more than 20 years; a man who just a few short weeks ago was so dismissive of the problems of the `stolen generation'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister should know that the person after whom his seat is named&mdash;a seat he has represented for 20 years&mdash;was in fact one of the first Aborigines to be stolen, not a child but an adult.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator BOB COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Listen, Minister; you may learn something. He didn't die of smallpox at all. You would be hard&hyphen;pressed in fact to find a more suitable example of our racist bigoted past than to look at the life of Bennelong that was a prototype for the process of dispossession of Aboriginal people which began in 1788.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Historians have certainly recalled&mdash;and I would be surprised if Mr Howard does not know it&mdash;that Governor Phillip's stated intention with respect to Aborigines shortly after white settlement was `to cultivate an acquaintance with them without their having an idea of our great superiority over them that their confidence and friendship might be more firmly fixed'&mdash;all very good sentiments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Captain Phillip designed a process by which he was going to do this by capturing an Aboriginal person forcibly and taking him away from his people. In December 1788 an Aboriginal man named Arabanoo was captured to be introduced to the `benefits of European civilisation'. Unfortunately, the first benefit Arabanoo was introduced to was smallpox from which he had the bad taste to die six months later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Captain Phillip then captured two other Aborigines, Bennelong and Colebee. Bennelong managed to escape in April 1790 and later that year he and Colebee were sighted in Manly. When Captain Phillip went to talk to them he was speared by another older Aboriginal. Bennelong, who had taken no part in the attack, began to appear frequently near Sydney Cove and, when assured he would not be detained, his visits became more frequent. A small brick hut was eventually built to house Bennelong and his family at Bennelong Point on the site now occupied by the Opera House of which the Prime Minister enjoys the best view in Australia from Kirribilli House across the harbour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sadly, from the day that he was captured his life went rapidly downhill. He found himself alienated from his own people and the white settlers and his despair was reflected in his behaviour. He developed a very early taste for another of the benefits of European civilisation, that is, strong drink. He was spending <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4702"> most of his time drunk and disorderly before eventually meeting a violent death.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of this brief history is found in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Encyclopaedia</EMPHASIS> on the parliamentary database. Does the Prime Minister seriously suggest that this should be removed? Should we also remove from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Encyclopaedia</EMPHASIS> reference to the Coniston massacre or to the White Australia Policy or to the fact that next year, 1997, will mark the 30th&mdash;I say again the 30th&mdash;anniversary of Australian Aborigines becoming citizens in their own country? Thirty years is not exactly pre&hyphen;history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the case that Australia does have a racist and bigoted past. I do not believe we should go around feeling guilty about it but at least we should have the honesty to own it. What worries me far more than that is that a lot of Australians are now asking whether silence or prime ministerial equivocation will condemn us to a racist and bigoted future. I think that is a far more important question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government, for example, has no empathy at all with Aboriginal Australia. Aborigines have been targeted by this government from day one. The central issue at the first cabinet meeting of this government in Canberra on 9 April and the first prime ministerial press conference in Canberra on 10 April was Aborigines and their alleged lack of accountability. After its failed attempt to gain power to sack the board and appoint an administrator and its bungled appointment of a special auditor, the government imposed savage cuts on inarguably the most dispossessed section of the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The devastating picture of these cuts is slowly emerging through the hearings of the finance and public administration committee. ATSIC has estimated its global loss of funding over the next four years at $470 million. With three&hyphen;quarters of its budget effectively quarantined from cuts by the government, the ATSIC board was then left to do the government's dirty work. It was left to find in excess of 30 per cent cuts across 27 per cent of the budget still left under its control. It was given 48 hours to make the deadline for the inclusion of its decisions in the budget papers from the time it was given absolute confir mation of the magnitude of those cuts. As you would expect, ATSIC is still trying to assess the full impact of the 30 per cent across&hyphen;the&hyphen;board cuts to programs that address the needs of young people, children, women, the aged and the disabled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Cuts to the community and youth support component, for example, will see, on current information, over 1,000 people lose their jobs and 206 Aboriginal organisations are expected to close down while others downsize unless they can find alternative funding. What did the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) say in the estimates committee hearings in the face of all this? It is in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> in black and white. He said, `No pain, no gain.' That is how he summed up the cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government, as I said in the Senate estimates, has effectively clamped three of ATSIC's wheels and forced it to slash the other tyre. One is compelled to ask: why don't they simply have it towed away? Let's stop the pretence; let's stop the Prime Ministerial double talk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) never wanted ATSIC in the first place. Mr Howard, in his first ever news conference as Prime Minister in Canberra, said that the government's decision to appoint a Special Auditor and to seek the power to appoint an administrator was in direct response to `a set of management challenges that have specifically arisen since the election'&mdash;that is, in the few short weeks between 2 March and 9 April. What nonsense that was!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) gave the game away just a few moments later when he said, `There are many allegations. There have been allegations for years.' You cannot avoid being deeply suspicious of this government's agenda on Aboriginal affairs when you look at the public record on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, there is vintage Prime Minister as Leader of the Opposition in debate on a ministerial statement on the administration of Aboriginal affairs on 11 April 1989. He said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4703">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ATSIC legislation strikes at the heart of the unity of the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on in the same debate to attack strongly the formation of ATSIC. It is impossible to believe that he did not carry these sentiments into government on 2 March. There is no doubt at all in my mind, and never has been, that all the moves against ATSIC since 2 March stem firmly from his ideology rather than any management problems discovered in the few short weeks after the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What of the minister? He began his career telling Aboriginal people he wanted to be a part-time minister and continue, in his own words, his practice as a weekend hobby surgeon in complete defiance of the Prime Ministerial code of ministerial conduct. The Prime Minister told him that he could not continue to be a weekend hobby surgeon, but he obviously did not tell him that he could quit being a part-time minister, because that is exactly how he performs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This has been amply demonstrated in Senate estimates and in this chamber. The most glaring and recent example was his tabling in this chamber of the Special Auditor's final report and the selective quoting from that document by the minister to put the darkest possible complexion on the findings of the Special Auditor. But, even worse, he compounded the problem by then selectively quoting, and gleefully quoting, from a number of totally misleading and colourful newspaper reports to support his appointment of the Special Auditor. He owned up to this fact last week in Senate estimates, but he astounded everyone by saying that he did not say that these reports that he read out in the chamber were an accurate representation of the Special Auditor's report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I pointed out&mdash;and this is the reason I am making this speech tonight&mdash;the minister has now flatly refused again and again and again to correct the record. As I pointed out to the minister at the time, he selectively quoted from the newspapers that, in fact, carried sensational and, in his own words, inaccurate reports. On the same day they were published, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspapers&mdash;both on the same day, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the 15th&mdash;carried totally accurate reports of the Special Auditor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are not minor, backwoods papers. This is the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>. Almost everyone in this building gets both of them or has access to both of them. They carried totally accurate reports. The minister selectively did not choose to quote from either of these reports. He has consistently refused to identify the inaccuracies that he so lovingly read into the parliamentary record from the stories that were all written by the same journalist. I seek leave to table the two press reports.</PARA>

As I go around the remote communities there is enormous criticism from people in remote communities, as I have said on the record, about a fire hose of money at one end and a trickle coming out the other.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The monitoring of the use of chemicals and antibiotics in livestock production is the responsibility of the States and Territories. In addition, the National Residue Survey monitors for chemical and antibiotic residues in livestock produce.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals is currently compiling a list of the amounts of usage of chemicals and antibiotics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) A list of registered antibiotics and growth promoters approved for use in respect to livestock, poultry, etc in Australia is available from the National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals.</PARA>
<PARA><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4709"></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) The growth promoters Zeranol, Trenbolone, oestrogen, testosterone, and progesterone are registered in Australia for use in cattle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) The European Union's ban on the importation of meat from animals administered with certain growth promoters is currently being considered under the World Trade Organisation dispute settlement procedures.

The most recent report is the "The Report of the Scientific Committee for Animal Nutrition (SCAN) on the possible risk for humans on the use of Avoparcin as feed additive".
