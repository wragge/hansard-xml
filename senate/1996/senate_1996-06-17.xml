<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to Senator Short, the Assistant Treasurer. Senator, the Treasurer announced in writing that sales tax will be payable on all vehicles bought by state and local governments after 3.15 p.m. on 11 June. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer then announced orally on 14 June that the earlier announcement was wrong, and that only certain cars would be taxed. Could you please advise the Senate of any precedent of withdrawing a written taxation announcement with an oral one. Do you believe that this is a good way to make tax policy? Has any tax been charged to state or local governments under the previously announced regime, and will this tax be refunded?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="1581" SPEAKER="Short, Sen Jim" NAMEID="DJ4" ELECTORATE="VIC" PARTY="LP" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to Senator Wheelwright's question, I think he has got his <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> starting point wrong. The fact is that on 11 June, in advance of the Premiers Conference, the Treasurer announced the Commonwealth's proposals in relation to the conference, including the question of sales tax. He said in that statement on 11 June that the Commonwealth would be proposing to remove the exemption from sales tax currently enjoyed by Commonwealth, state, territory and local governments. He also said, in terms of the specifics, that it would apply to vehicles purchased from that day by Commonwealth, state and territory governments. He also said that, so far as the remainder of the sales tax arrangements for non&hyphen;vehicles was concerned, that would involve negotiations with the states on transitional arrangements and the like.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the position that the Commonwealth government went into the Premiers Conference on. The reason why it went in on that basis was, of course, because it was aware&mdash;as were all the states, Senator Wheelwright, contrary, I think, to your party opposite, which vandalised the finances of this country for 13 years&mdash;that it was necessary for all members of the Australian community and all levels of government to make a contribution towards meeting the deficit reduction of $8 billion that the government inherited two days after the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fortunately, the whole basis for the Premiers Conference was that&mdash;unlike Labor opposite&mdash;the state and territory premiers and leaders acknowledged that there was a need and a responsibility on all our parts to make a contribution to that deficit reduction which was the direct cause of the irresponsibility of the previous Labor government. As happens with all premiers conferences&mdash;and they have been the same from time immemorial&mdash;the whole basis of the conference is that you go and discuss the different ways of meeting the objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The important outcome of the Premiers Conference was that the result&mdash;the bottom line result&mdash;was a very satisfactory outcome indeed for the Commonwealth.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, because, with the contribution that has been made by the state <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and territory leaders, we have a very significant and very important contribution towards the deficit reduction that we inherited from the previous Labor government. It is the bottom line that is important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is correct to say that we would have preferred to have had a more equitable result on the sales tax arrangements as a whole, but the outcome, so far as private vehicles are concerned, is that, where they form part of the remuneration package of an employee, they will be covered, and that is a very desirable advance. You had 13 years to do something about this&mdash;13 years. You were not game to tackle any of the hard questions. We had a go at it. We negotiated well with the Commonwealth, the states and the territories, and we achieved a very satisfactory result. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></ANSWER>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The finances slipped to such an extent that this government inherited an $8 billion deficit which, contrary to what you opposite may believe, actually does have the effect of increasing interest rates, actually does have the effect of increasing unemployment, actually does have the effect of reducing job creation and actually does have the effect of reducing economic growth and reducing the living standards of all Australians. This government was elected to repair that damage that 13 years of Labor mismanagement and fiscal vandalism had caused.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unlike you Labor Party members opposite, the welcome fact is that the state and territory leaders accepted that need. They were prepared to accept and shoulder their responsibilities in the interests of all Australians. What is absolutely disgraceful is that the Labor Party opposition in this chamber, which caused the problem through the erosion of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> integrity in government financing, is not prepared to accept and share in the need for the restoration of fiscal responsibility and the integrity of the finances of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The outcome of the conference was very satisfactory indeed, because the result is that the states are going to contribute approximately $1.5 billion to fix up the budget bottom line over the next two to three years. They have accepted that in a spirit of compromise and cooperation which does them great credit, and discredits those opposite. They acted with a high degree of responsibility, and the Commonwealth accepts and welcomes that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say again that Labor created the problem. The government that was elected on 2 March was elected to fix the problem. It is fixing it. I am delighted that it is doing it with the full cooperation of the states and territories.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. I remind him of a statement made by the now Treasurer, Mr Costello, to the National Press Club on 17 May 1995, when he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not our agenda to introduce new taxes. It is not our agenda to bulk up the currently existing taxes.</PARA>
<PARA>Do you agree that an expansion of the wholesale sales tax to cover items that are currently exempt from that tax constitutes the breaking of this promise? If not, why not?</PARA></QUESTION>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not too sure what the now Treasurer said on 17 May 1995, but I can well believe that that is what he did say because everything that he and this government have done since the election has been in accordance with that statement. For you to say that the proposals put to the premiers last week constitute any change to that is a total misunderstanding by you of the nature of the taxation system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that on numerous occasions before the election and on equally numerous occasions since the election the Treasurer, the Prime Minister, myself and others have made it clear that in terms of getting the finances of this country right, on the revenue side, the question of exemptions and anomalies are <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1583"> matters that need to be looked at.

Two days after the election they sat down and worked out how they were going to deliberately break those promises, which they knew they never had any intention of meeting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> They were a government which, two months after the election in 1993, increased sales tax across the board and introduced new taxes over a whole range of areas. They were broken promises. Everyone knows that that was the case. The fact is, Senator Sherry, that nothing that was said by the government last week in any way contravened the total commitment that we have given to the Australian people that we will not be introducing new taxes or increasing existing taxes.</PARA></ANSWER>

I draw the minister's attention to the report released by UNICEF last week showing that Australia is one of only five industrialised nations to have more than 10 per cent of its children living in poverty.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is pleasing that Labor spokesmen are just starting to accept the reality. You would have noticed Gary Gray, the party secretary, when he was asked a few days ago why they lost government, saying it was because they failed to understand the needs of families. That is what it is. Families suffered under your policy. Under your policy the gap grew between rich and poor; the poor became poorer and the families suffered. More children ended up in poverty.

The government was too arrogant and forgot the needs of its supporters; too interested in Mr Keating's so-called big picture to worry about the masses out there who were suffering. It is not surprising that they were suffering. There was mass unemployment. There is still three-quarters of a million Australians out of work. They gave us youth unemployment of 30 to 40 per cent out in the region. These are the young people of Australia who could not get jobs under Labor.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a better approach. It does require hard decisions.

So far as the particular comments by Mr Stockdale and the South Australian Premier are concerned, I do not agree that there were broken promises involved, for precisely the sorts of reasons that I have given in answer to the earlier question. That is an academic issue now because, after some very sensible&mdash;sure, it was pretty spirited and I am sure it was pretty heavy&mdash;negotiations between all parties, they arrived at a result which was a very satisfactory bottom line for the Commonwealth and an arrangement that was well accepted by all the premiers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why the press communique at the end of the conference says that the Commonwealth, states and territories have agreed that the real per capita indexation arrangements for financial assistance grants will be extended to 1998-99. That is a very positive advance for the states. It is a very positive and satisfactory outcome for them. The statement also makes the point, the very welcome point that I have kept saying today, that the states and the territories will be making payments to the Commonwealth over each of the next three years. It also makes the very important statement, which has not been widely reported, that `the need for these payments to be made by the states and territories will be reviewed annually at future Premiers Conferences in the light of the Commonwealth's fiscal position'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is unlike what your party did in its 13 years of government. It came in and tried to hit the states on the head with a sledgehammer.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Assistant Treasurer. Minister, the Treasurer said gleefully last week that he was pursuing the elimination of tax rorts on behalf of Mr and Mrs Joe Average. There is a very interesting article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS>  by Mike Steketee, titled `Where the real rorts are'. It details a wide range of expensive rorts, which we are all aware of. Two of them, the infrastructure borrowings tax concessions and the superannuation tax concessions, result in Mr and Mrs Joe Average underwriting, to the tune of billions of dollars, the incomes of the well above average. I ask you Minister: using the Joe Average argument, are these two tax concessions under active review as part of the budget process or are some rorts more equal than others?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Actually, some of the choices are really quite relevant. One of the criticisms you would put to me, Senator Margetts, is in fact that the LPG plants producing from the north&hyphen;west coast are contributing to this whilst in fact they are producing fuel that substitutes for poor quality coal in Asia and thus in a global sense are contributing to a better outcome.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why this whole picture is a complex one. You do not get the best picture simply by looking at the circumstances of each individual state. If you want to be fair, you should look at the contribution of each individual state to the total international picture. We, as a nation, must look at our contribution to that, and if there are ways in which we can improve our performance in relation to emissions of greenhouse gases we should do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that sense, I take the opportunity to acknowledge the very positive programs that a number of Australia's largest companies have now entered into to improve their <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> record.

Are you aware of an opinion poll showing that 85 per cent of the population of that area do not want our nuclear waste? Are you also aware that Dounreay has a documented history of accidents and mismanagement of nuclear waste and that the area around Dounreay has the second highest rate of childhood leukaemia in Britain&mdash;the only worse area being around Sellafield, the other reprocessing plant?

We do not have to spend so much money on meeting the interest payment and the repayments on the debts of Labor governments, which have squandered the heritage of this country and have sold assets of this nation and then just blown them away in recurrent expenditure. That is the fundamental difference between this side of politics and Labor opposite.</PARA>

<PARA>For the first time a minister in this government has used a new defence in question time. Senator Short now says that he refuses to answer any substantive question from the opposition on the basis that those questions are hypothetical. He now refuses to answer any question from the opposition on the basis that those questions are academic. Then, if that fails, he uses the new ploy that the questions are `out of date'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Short's performance in this chamber today, in an attempt to defend Mr Costello and the government's efforts last week at the Premiers Conference, was absolutely pathetic. I put to the Senate that the government's original proposal to introduce a wide ranging sales tax, the Costello sales tax, which was later revoked to apply to all vehicles, was an ill&hyphen;judged, incompetent and an absolutely inept and unwarranted breach of trust from this government. It was a breach of trust with the state and territory governments and also with the electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's performance, particularly Mr Costello's performance, was both dishonest and humiliating. Mr Costello did this without any consultation with the premiers. It was a crude and blatant breach of at least two coalition election promises. Mr Costello and the coalition had promised, `There'll be no new taxes and no increases in existing taxes under a coalition government.' Mr Costello also promised on 19 February:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coalition's position on Commonwealth&hyphen;state relations is quite clear. The premiers have requested a fixed percentage of revenue to facilitate better planning and give certainty. We'll negotiate this through COAG. The formula would have to be an average one. The formula to be adopted is one that will guarantee current services and be revenue neutral.</PARA>
<PARA>Both those promises were broken in Mr Costello's offer to the states. Then when Senator Short is asked a specific question about sales tax applying to privately plated vehicles&mdash;will departments be supplemented as they were for fringe benefits tax&mdash;Senator Short cannot answer.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been $68 billion worth of increased debt in the four years of the Keating government, which has ensured that all Australians pay a premium in interest rates. They pay much higher interest rates than our trading partners around the world. Accumulated deficits, pushing that debt up, mean that not only do we pay higher interest rates for our homes but also small business people pay a premium if they want to borrow a bit of extra money to expand operations or set up a new business or employ more people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at what Senator Faulkner was talking about in his speech in favour of his motion to take note of an answer given by Senator Short. He referred to the Premiers Conference. Who was a backbencher when sensible moves were being made towards getting federal&hyphen;state relations and financial relations back on track? Mr Keating. Mr Hawke when he was Prime Minister and Mr Greiner when he was Premier of New South Wales tried to make some progress in the very important area of federal&hyphen;state financial relations. They tried to get cooperation between the states and federal government in relation to fiscal management back on a sensible path.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Keating, then a backbencher, decided that for his own personal political future he would go and undermine that process of federal-state relations&mdash;the very good start that was made by former Prime Minister Bob Hawke and premiers such as Mr Greiner. Mr Keating did that. Mr Keating got Australia <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1595"> back to the good old centralism where the federal government says what goes and that is what happens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What occurred last week? The federal government and the state governments, through Mr Howard, Mr Costello and the five state Liberal premiers and the one Labor state premier, sat around in this building and came to an agreement which did a couple of things. The most important thing it did was ensure that the states share the burden. That occurred against their wills of course, because no state wants to give up hundreds of millions of dollars of taxation. None of them are going to come to Canberra and say, `Mr Howard, Mr Costello: here is a blank cheque. We are going to hand over this money to help you fill in Beazley's black hole.' They did it against their wills entirely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of the states are having to recover from some sort of pain. The state of Victoria was having to recover from the Cain and Kirner disasters. The state of South Australia was having to recover from the disastrous Bannon years and the State Bank fiasco. The state of Western Australia was having to recover from the Burke, Dowding and Lawrence years. They have all had to cut their budgets and go through the pain of fiscal consolidation after Labor mismanagement. Of course, federally we have to find around $8 billion just to give us a chance at bringing our budget back to even again, back in the black, so that we are not mortgaging the futures of young Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week's Premiers Conference was a great success, and not only for the federal and state governments, who agreed to share this burden of trying to restore economic sanity to Australia. More importantly, the big winners out of last week's compact between the state and federal governments are future generations&mdash;the young people around Australia who will be able to look forward to a sound economic future because state Liberal governments and the federal Liberal coalition sat down and reached a sensible agreement in relation to Australia's future fiscal management. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honeymoon that this government has been enjoying for the last three months&mdash;the first 100 days&mdash;is over. The electorate now sees this government in the real light: putting up a proposal which, according to answers given in question time today, has not even been calculated in terms of the retaliatory measures that would have been taken against it by the states.

He turned in one of the most inept performances by a spokesman for the Treasurer I have ever seen in this chamber in all of my time here. We had a direct commentary on the Victorian Treasurer's comment that what we had seen from Mr Costello was a broken Howard promise. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1596"> That was the comment of a Victorian Liberal Treasurer about a federal Liberal Treasurer. We had the representative of that federal Liberal Treasurer saying that the Victorian Liberal Treasurer was one of the best treasurers we had seen in Australia. The circle was completed. Someone in this is telling a lie. Yet in this effort to try to back one another they reach into hypocrisy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is well known about this proposal is that it would never have worked. Had anyone sat down for five seconds and worked out what would have occurred once the proposal had been introduced, they would have known that. Indeed Mike Cable in a small article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on the weekend, points to the retaliatory action and spells it out. We all know what it would have been. He said that the states would have held on to their cars for longer periods, thus thwarting it. Or they would have switched to smaller, less expensive cars and gone overseas, out of Australia, and bought foreign cars from the Koreans or others, thus thwarting it. Or the states would have reduced their fleets, thus thwarting the proposal. Or any one of the above three options would have been introduced in some way, thus thwarting the proposal. Mr Costello could not work it out. Everyone else could, and the premiers were the first and quickest ones to do the arithmetic as to how they would have overcome this proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point that needs to be made here is that this was an exercise in holding to ransom the core industry for the Australian manufacturing sector. This was Russian roulette with the Australian car industry. At a time when tariffs are falling, when the Australian dollar is appreciating, when government programs are being cut and when the industry is facing its greatest challenge, the Costello plan would have destroyed the car industry in Australia. There is no doubt. Ask Ford, Holden, Mitsubishi or Toyota. Four thousand jobs would have been directly lost. With a multiplier of 2&half; to three, up to 12,000 jobs in the whole industry would have been lost.</PARA>

The issue that was being debated last week was the debt that has been left by the former Labor government. As Senator Campbell said, none of the premiers wanted to give up one single dollar. We would have preferred that they not have to give up a dollar, but that was necessitated by the fact that Labor have left this country in a parlous state.

A day or two after the election, the Treasury was able to give Mr Costello a briefing on the exact situation we were in. We found, to our dismay, that it was a lot worse: there was an $8 billion hole. Mr Beazley can protest over and again that that does not exist, but the Australian public are aware of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In their discussion, the premiers came to an alternative arrangement, and that was put forward by Mr Costello. Last Tuesday he said, `If they come up with an alternative, then we'll look at it.' They came up with an alternative, as Senator Campbell said. They <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1597"> did not want to give up any money, but Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia all realised that after a Labor government has been in you have got to have pain, because they spend as if there is no tomorrow. It is not their money. They say, `We'll live for today because there'll be no tomorrow.' The dawn comes, and we have to front up with the money. Look at what we owe. It is 300 per cent more than we owed four years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How much do we pay on interest payments? In the last few days there has been a lot of discussion in the newspapers about interest payments on home loans. We all know that if our home loan interest rate goes up by one per cent it puts a bit of a dent in our weekly budgets. If it goes down half a per cent, we know that we are going to have a bit more to spend. Look at the sorts of interest rates that we are paying as a nation. As an Australian family, we are paying off the mortgage that we have been left with by the former Labor government. Public debt interest payments are now $10 billion per annum. We are paying an interest rate on public debt of $10 billion per annum. That is the mortgage that the former Labor government has left for us to pay. Those opposite have the gall to come in here and raise the issue of what happened last week at the premiers conference. It would not have had to have happened if we had not been left with this outrageous debt and this outrageous interest bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have example after example of the way in which Australia has been misled. At the budget last year in May 1995, Labor announced a headline surplus of $720 million for 1995-96 and a headline surplus of $3.4 billion for 1996-97. In the mid-year review they said that we were still in surplus. Before the election Mr Beazley was saying that we were in surplus, but in fact we were not. So we have to search for ways in which to redress that debt. That is the essence of what happened last week. Those opposite can sit over there and cry all they like about the fact that last week may not have ended up exactly the way Mr Costello set out for it to end up. But he said up-front on Tuesday, `If there is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> an alternative which the premiers can put, we will look at it.' And they did.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Cook said that Australians will calculate what happened last week by looking at the effect on their hip pockets.

My comments will have a very familiar ring to many colleagues sitting on the opposition benches who have come from the union movement. As many a good union organiser well knows, some of the most robust of negotiations result in the best outcomes. It was the outcomes on which my colleague Senator Short concentrated most successfully this afternoon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A successful outcome followed the Premiers Conference. As Senator Short said, the outcome was satisfactory in that the states did recognise that they do have a role in overcoming a most embarrassing deficit that must be sheeted home to the previous ALP federal government. It makes for very easy government to run up debt. Some of this debt is deliberate while other debt results from bad policies. In this latter category, we categorise international debt, which rose from about $34 billion when those opposite came into power under the Hawke administration to about $180 billion when Mr Keating left office. The first <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1599"> responsibility of this responsible new coalition government is to restore the underlying budget. I believe that we are moving in that direction very satisfactorily.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today's question time showed the utter hypocrisy of the ALP in relation to so-called broken tax promises. Other questions were preoccupied with attempting to debate or highlight a whole lot of immediate situations rather than concentrating on the final outcome. Perhaps those opposite were somewhat embarrassed as a result of what was a very satisfactory final Premiers Conference outcome, despite some hard bargaining in the process.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too wish to be associated with Senator Hill's condolence motion. Wednesday, 12 June this year was a very sad day for all Australians when the worst peacetime military aviation disaster occurred, snatching the lives of 18 young Australians who were prepared to sacrifice their lives for the rest of us. It seems so insignificant to express one's sympathy to the wives, the girlfriends, the children, the parents, the  brothers, the sisters and the wider family and friends at a time when such wonderful lives have gone from people who were prepared to put everything on the line for the rest of us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It must be said that our pride in what men such as the ones who lost their lives do is enduring. As a Western Australian senator, it grieves me to say that eight of those 18 personnel came from Western Australia.

That is not to diminish the importance of those others who gave their lives, but to those from Western Australia I would like to pay significant tribute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to acknowledge and thank all of those service personnel and civilians who helped with the rescue and who will no doubt continue to help the survivors and the relatives of both the deceased and the survivors. I extend my very good wishes to those men who did survive the tragedy, particularly those who, once again, came from my state of Western Australia: Corporal Dominic Boyle, Corporal Gary John Proctor, Trooper Gerard Crossley Bampton and Trooper Glenn Robert Sutton. Those people will no doubt come home to our fine state and continue the work that they are yet to finish. I certainly acknowledge all of those who have been so tragically affected.

It was certainly a sad day for Queensland, for Australia and for all Australians when this tragedy took place involving two Black Hawk helicopters.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Out of the accident came some incredible acts of courage&mdash;mates saving mates. I believe that needs to be mentioned today. The description by Captain David Burke, a surviving helicopter pilot, of those acts of courage shows clearly the mateship, the training and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the way in which soldier helped soldier. Captain Burke said that staff stationed on the ground raced into action as the helicopters hit the deck. He said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 12 June this year, 18 men tragically lost their lives in the course of serving their country. As we have heard today, 15 of those 18 men were from the Special Air Service and three from the 5th Aviation Regiment. On that night of the tragedy, the exercise involved an anti-terrorist exercise. It has been described as high risk, but for these men it was routine. I rise to pay tribute to these men, to the sacrifice that they and their families have made for their country and to the important role those serving in the armed forces play in peace time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Special Air Service, famous for its operations in Borneo in the mid&hyphen;1960s and in south Vietnam from 1966 to 1971, was firstly set up as the SAS company in Swanbourne, Western Australia, on 25 July 1957. At that stage, it consisted of four platoons, comprising 200 soldiers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 4 September 1964, the company was expanded to regimental strength and was renamed the Special Air Service Regiment. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1603"> The Special Air Service Regiment gained much praise for its work in Vietnam in the late 1960s and early 1970s, with patrols alerting the Australian task force in Vietnam to heavy enemy build-up east of Nui Dat in August 1966. This was immediately before the battle of Long Tan, which was to be Australia's biggest battle in the course of that conflict.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Special Air Service's mission is to conduct special operations to promote the security of Australia and protect its people and its interests. To that end, we all owe a great deal to those 18 men and their defence force counterparts around the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Newspaper reports since last week's tragedy have told of extreme acts of bravery, including a crewman dying while running through flames and exploding ammunition to drag an injured soldier from the burning aircraft. Witnesses reported rounds going off, ammunition flying in the air and explosives going off in the rear of aircraft at the same time as SAS personnel and aircrew were going into the flames, cutting people free and taking them out of the exploding helicopters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> on the morning after the tragedy reported that the Special Air Service is the Australian Army's elite, a close group which regards itself as family. The bravery shown last Wednesday has highlighted that closeness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For my own part, I understand that the use of live ammunition is necessary during training, which must be dangerous if it is to be effective. The Special Air Services motto `Who dares wins' is an apt reflection of the regiment's understanding of the dangers associated with its duties. I ask the Senate this evening to remember the families of those who have died and to remember those who were injured and are recovering in hospital. I wish them all a speedy recovery.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join with other senators in expressing my condolences to the families and friends of those victims of the Black Hawk helicopter crash on the high range country near Townsville last week. Australia has an extraordinary and proud military history that recognises the sacrifices <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that both soldiers and civilians make during wartime.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The great majority of Australians have not experienced wartime, which we can only be very thankful for, but last week the whole nation witnessed a tragedy that was a stark reminder of the dangers that face our defence forces all the time. It was a tragedy that ran a shiver down everybody's spine. Our defence forces face danger on a day-to-day basis. It may not be danger in the expected form of war or armed conflict but it is still present when Australia's armed forces are part of peacekeeping or training for all eventualities and, in particular, anti-terrorist activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fifteen fit, young men who served in Australia's most elite force, the Special Air Services regiment, lost their lives last Wednesday afternoon. As a part of that service, they were practising anti-terrorist manoeuvres when their Black Hawk helicopters collided and crashed. In addition, three pilots and air crew from the 5th Aviation Regiment died. As a result, these men paid the ultimate price in their desire to defend their country. The SAS acknowledge they are in a high risk business and they suffer at least one fatality in training per year, which is probably something that not a lot of Australians realise. I speak today to honour these men and their families for the sacrifice they have made and the terrible sorrow and sense of loss families and friends are feeling at this moment. Nothing we can say can make them feel any joy at this time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently I had the opportunity to officially dedicate a peace tree in Coonamble in western New South Wales to those locals who had made sacrifices both at home and abroad during World War II. Many locals turned up for the ceremony to make sure that those sacrifices made during the world war were not forgotten. So too the sacrifices of these young men will not be forgotten.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will also be many, especially within the defence forces, who will be affected personally by this tragedy. In Singleton, New South Wales, where my electorate office is located, there is the Singleton army camp where at least eight of these men went through the infantry school. Tomorrow they <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1604"> will hold a memorial service, and I am very sorry that I am not able to be there to help them commemorate this loss.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Northern New South Wales will particularly mourn the loss of Brett Tombs, who was among the casualties. Brett Tombs' parents live in Armidale and he had plans to resign from the SAS to continue his university studies at the Armidale university.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We must not forget that, as well as being fine soldiers, these men were also sons, husbands and fathers who had a role outside their service involvement. Those victims as well will feel this loss for the rest of their lives. The grief of the relatives and friends of these soldiers can only be understood by other people who have lost loved ones in the defence forces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These servicemen will be added to the list of servicemen and women who have given their lives for the defence of Australia. There is no doubt that this loss will also be felt throughout Australia. I am sure that I speak on behalf of all senators when I say that we are also extremely saddened by the loss of these fine young Australians.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> It is a tragedy that has been felt throughout Western Australia because the SAS enjoys a special place within Western Australian society. I think every Western Australian either knows someone in, or has had some association with, the regiment. They have a fine reputation not only as soldiers but also as citizens in Western Australia. I have had a great deal of contact mainly with former personnel who have often gone on to serve in other services of the community, such as the fire and ambulance services, when they leave the SAS. As I have said, the SAS and its per sonnel have a very high reputation throughout the Western Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On a lighter note, my main contact with serving members has been on the rugby field where I have learnt of their strength, hardness and endurance while generally being knocked about by them. It has always been a great pleasure to play against a local rugby club called Associates, which over many years has had a close association with the SAS and many SAS soldiers have played for and represented the club. I express my sympathies to the club and its members because I know they feel the loss very deeply.</PARA>

I associate myself with it in acknowledging the passing of the 18 men, eight of whom were Western Australians, in the preparation and training for service to their country.</PARA></TALK.START>

Once again, I can say that on the cricket field they are very well trained, extremely fit and worthy opponents.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The SAS Regiment and the 5th Aviation Regiment in Townsville have a very special feeling about them. There is great esprit de corp, a great sense of being a regimental family in which everybody is bound up in the one endeavour, not just the Defence Force personnel but also those who love and support them. I can imagine just a little of what it must be like in Perth and in Townsville for those units, the survivors, their loved ones and the loved ones of the victims in trying to come to terms with this terrible tragedy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The members of these two regiments have great pride in their achievements. They have great skills, and great commitment to the role they have been given to play in the defence of Australia. Just last year I was in Perth when some of those who are now dead demonstrated to me their skills and training, so I feel this loss very personally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should all be very proud of these men. They have a training regime which is constant and unremitting. The level of skill they achieve, as we have read and heard about in the last few days in connection with the rescue of the survivors, is what tells when times are tough. Training will out; you get to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the stage where training takes over and, in a sense, thought processes are suspended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to go on and on but these men are not usually very newsworthy. It saddens me that, while in the last few days the newspapers and other media have focused on the role of our army, we usually ignore the role it plays altogether. I do not want to strike a sour note now but I ask Australians: do Defence Force personnel have to die before the nation publicly expresses its pride in their commitment and skills. They serve us every day in peacetime and they train hard to ensure that we stay at peace. I hope that one thing Australians will learn from this tragedy is that we all must let our defence force know how much we value them.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The nation has suffered a very grievous loss: the loss to the army of 18 soldiers; the loss, the greatest in its history, to the Australian Special Air Service Regiment of 15 of its members, all from one squadron&mdash;roughly 15 per cent of a squadron, which is a huge casualty rate for any unit to bear. But above all, there is the irreparable loss to these men's families. These men were not 18&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds; they were mostly 10 years older than that. So the loss was not only to their parents: it was to their wives and children. I am told that at least two of those who were killed had three very young children. Our deepest sympathy goes out to those families at this moment. Nothing we can do can restore their fathers and their husbands.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I found the size of the loss very hard to comprehend. You can understand two or three people being killed but the enormity of 18 being killed in one accident is almost beyond comprehension. It was only on Friday morning when I was standing in the rain at the memorial service held outside the brigade headquarters in Townsville and saw the 18 rifles with bayonets attached stuck into the ground with the sand berets of the SAS and the blue berets of the 5th Aviation Regiment on the butts that the size of the loss came through to me. It graphically illustrated the nature of military service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those who have never worn the uniform of the armed services often do not appreciate <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1606"> what is involved. The Australian Defence Force is not a collection of civil servants in uniform. It does not exist to provide ceremonial parades or United Nations peacekeeping duties. The task of its members is to defend the nation with their lives when all else fails. Because of that, the training must be as realistic as possible, and it must always, therefore, be dangerous. Despite the best of planning, some accidents will always occur, though we and the services themselves must do everything to prevent and forestall lives being lost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Wednesday night's accident does illustrate the risks involved in this training, the selflessness of the Australian Defence Force and the readiness of its members to train themselves for the roles they will need in war.

<PARA>Thomas Tehan was born in Kyabram, Victoria, on 18 January 1916. He started his education at the Timmering East State School and St Mary's Convent, Tatura, completing his secondary education at Xavier College, Kew. He began working in the state taxation office, and in 1942 he was awarded a university free place which enabled him to successfully go on and complete a law degree at Melbourne University.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He joined the Victorian Crown Solicitor's Office in 1943. In 1947 he was admitted to practice as a barrister and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Victoria, and it was also at this time that he began his long association with Morrison and Sawers Solicitors in Kyabram, where he worked as a former partner and consultant until his death.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tom joined the then Country Party in 1949 and held positions of member of the Central Council from 1965 to 1973, senior vice&hyphen;president from 1973 to 1975 and Victorian state president in 1975. Last year he was awarded life membership of the National Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tom was elected to the Senate in 1975. In his maiden speech on 26 February the following year he spoke of his support and commitment to primary industry issues and discussed the problems that faced Australian primary producers, in particular the fruit industry. He highlighted the importance of the family as a basic unit of society, and acknowledged the benefits of social welfare programs such as the child endowment scheme. He also expressed concern about the high level of road related deaths among young Australians, telling of his close association with a pilot scheme designed to educate young drivers at the newly established Goulburn Valley driver training complex in Shepparton.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tom made many contributions during his term in the Senate. Of particular note was his committee work. He worked as a member of the Senate Publications Committee, the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1607"> Standing Committee on Social Welfare and the Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, as well as estimates committees and the Joint Committee on the Parliamentary Committee System. He also served as chairman of the Joint Government Parties Law and Government Committee, helping argue the case for constitutional amendments, including the vital question of filling casual Senate vacancies with people of the same party, put to the 1977 referendum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Tom completed his term in the Senate in 1978, the then Liberal leader Reg Withers praised the `fundamental commonsense' that Tom brought to this chamber and commended him on his service to his town. It is interesting that he returned and continued to work for the local community. He served the Chamber of Commerce, the District Memorial Hospital Board and Rotary, and he was made a life member of the Knights of the Southern Cross.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tom's years of dedication and service to his local community were recognised in 1993 when he was named as the Kyabram Citizen of the Year. He led an active and rewarding life that was committed to helping others. He will be fondly remembered and sadly missed by those who knew him.

He was educated at St Mary's Convent, Tatura, and Xavier College. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1608"> In 1945, he obtained a Bachelor of Laws from Melbourne University. Upon graduation, he obtained employment in the state taxation office and then proceeded to the Victorian Crown Solicitor's Office. In 1947, he was admitted as a barrister and a solicitor in the Supreme Court of Victoria and, two years later, joined the firm of Morrison and Sawers. It was at this time he joined the Country Party&mdash;later the National Country Party and now the National Party&mdash;and his lifelong association with the party began.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tom Tehan was a man of unflagging commitment and drive. Despite the demands of a challenging legal career, assisting his wife Nance with his family responsibilities for his four children, and his active involvement in parish life, he still found time and commitment to contribute to the community of Kyabram. He was a board member of Kyabram hospital from 1948, served as president for 10 years from 1963, and was made a life governor in 1985.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He gave three decades of service to Rotary, during which time he was president of the Kyabram club in 1963-64 and district governor from 1980-81. He also served as a trustee of the Elderly Citizens Committee, the Kyabram Youth Club and the Kyabram Chamber of Commerce, among many others. For this long and meritorious service to the community, Tom was named Kyabram Citizen of the Year in 1993. He was made a member of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta in recognition of his community and charitable works.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Country Party greatly welcomed the drive of Tom Tehan and called on his natural leadership qualities. He became state vice&hyphen;president in 1973 and state president in 1975. He was a confidant of Jack McEwen and was a person everyone in the Victorian National Party turned to for guidance and advice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1975, Tom Tehan entered federal parliament as part of the Fraser&hyphen;Anthony landslide victory. In his first speech in the Senate, he foreshadowed the areas he would endeavour to represent: primary industry in particular, the dairy and horticultural industries, and family and youth issues. He threw himself wholeheartedly into committee work. His legal expertise was called on to chair the Joint <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Government Parties Law and Government Committee, and he was a hardworking member of the legal and constitutional affairs committee, the social welfare committee, the publications committee, and the Select Committee on Drug Trafficking and Drug Abuse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A man of immense promise, talent and drive, it was a great loss to the parliament and his Victorian constituents that his contribution was limited to only one term. Everyone spoke well of Tom Tehan, and he was genuinely liked by all. As he himself said during the valedictory debate:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has been said that one of the hallmarks of a successful politician is that he makes some enemies. If that is the litmus test, I have failed as I believe I have made many friends in this place and I leave with no enemies.</PARA>
<PARA>After leaving parliament, Tom resumed his law career and was a senior partner at Morrison and Sawers until 1987. He continued his unstinting service to community organisations. The things that were important to Tom Tehan were his family, his church, the law, the National Party and his community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tom Tehan will be remembered as a great community leader who unselfishly dedicated most of his life to the betterment of the community of Kyabram. On behalf of the National Party in the Senate I extend most sincere condolences to Nance, his family and many friends.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to pay my respects to the late Senator Tom Tehan who died on 1 June at St Vincents Hospital in Melbourne. As Senator Boswell has told the Senate, Senator Tehan was born in 1916 and came from the Goulburn Valley in Victoria. He was educated in Tatura and then at Xavier College in Melbourne. Tom married Nance Huggins in 1943 and they raised one son, Terry, and three daughters, Maree, Ann and Maureen. I convey to them and their partners and to his nine grandchildren, Madeleine and Georgia Thomas, Anna and Peter Robertson and Genevieve, Elizabeth, Sam, Nicholas and Thomas Lally, my deepest sympathy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1609"> The late Tom Tehan was an extremely warm and friendly man. He commenced his career as a solicitor in 1947 and was respect ed by his colleagues and by all who knew him. He won office by being elected to the Senate in 1975&mdash;a very exciting time in the history of the coalition&mdash;and he served for three years. Prior to Senator Tehan's election, the National Party had historically found it very difficult to continuously hold a Senate seat in Victoria. However, I understand in his hands it looked like it would go on forever. He served as Victorian state president of the National Party, was eight years on the Victorian central council and three years a member of federal council. He summed up his view of the National Party in his own Senate valedictory when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think we are a party which places great importance on loyalty to leadership and loyalty to the government or to the opposition, as the case may be, in the parliament of which we are a part.</PARA>
<PARA>Tom's involvement in his community was extensive, including his involvement in Rotary, of which he was a charter member and past president of the Kyabram Rotary Club, as well as being awarded the Rotary Paul Harris fellowship. He was president of the Kyabram Chamber of Commerce and served on the Kyabram Historical Society and numerous other community and church organisations. He was also Kyabram Citizen of the Year in 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his maiden speech the late Senator Tehan pointed out that certain sections of primary industry were facing troubled times. He mentioned the beef industry, the diary industry and the fruit industry&mdash;all particularly relevant to his region. Primary industry is still, unfortunately, facing troubled times, none more so than the beef industry. However, I am sure he would have been gratified to know that the diary industry at least is now one of our more successful and viable industries and the fruit industry, after suffering for many years, is now seeing some encouragement. He also mentioned his concern at the abuse of drugs by young people, a problem that I know still concerns me, members of our party and, in fact, all members of the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tom Tehan was an institution in the Goulburn Valley, having spent 40 years in the legal profession. The Senate might be interested to know of the notice that his former legal <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> firm, Morrison and Sawers, placed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> on Tuesday, 4 June 1996, in which he was described as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An innovator, a leader, a lawyer, but most of all a person of integrity and warmth. A friend and mentor to us all. Your memory will live long in the firm.</PARA>
<PARA>Even though I never had the pleasure of knowing Tom Tehan, his reputation and past deeds have gone before him. Some of his family are in the gallery today. I take this opportunity to offer them our sincere sympathy. The Senate salutes the memory of Tom Tehan and pays him our deepest and profound respects. I finish with a very interesting part of his own valedictory. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has been said that one of the hallmarks of a successful politician is that he makes some enemies. If that is the litmus test, I suppose I must believe I have failed because while I like to think that I have made many friends in this place, so far as I am aware, I leave it with no enemies.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The passing of former Senator Tehan is a great tragedy for the National Party and also for his family but, most importantly, for the community to which he contributed so much. It is one of the hallmarks of people in the country that they tend to contribute more to their communities than people in the city. No finer example could be seen of this than the life of Tom Tehan. Before coming into this place he was a lawyer, he was a committed member of his church, he was a member of Rotary, he was involved in the Chamber of Commerce, youth organisations, elderly citizens organisations, anything which could further the lot of the community in which he lived. That is the mark of a great contributor: to give more than you take, to offer more than you receive. By any measure, Tom Tehan was a great contributor.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was also a great contributor to the institution of parliament. I say that because I was minded to look at Senator Tehan's contribution to the Senate in the three years that he was here. Honourable senators might be interested to know that this robust debater spoke on everything from water hyacinth to skim milk powder, from unemployment through to the fruit canning industry in the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1610"> Goulburn Valley in which he lived. That is what parliamentarians should be: contributors to the debate, contributors to the parliament and contributors to the future of our nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Isn't it interesting that in the 1970s when some people were arguing that the dairy industry in Victoria should be shut down, Tom Tehan had the courage to stand up and say, `No, the dairy industry in Victoria should not be shut down. The dairy industry in Victoria has a viable future.' The facts have vindicated that confidence and courage that Senator Tehan showed some 20 years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also interesting to note that the scheme put forward by Tom Tehan for equalisation of prices was ultimately the solution that saved the dairy industry not just in Victoria but around Australia. It is the basis on which the Australian dairy industry now approaches Asia with courage and with conviction that we can produce the best product at the best price. If the dairy industry had not had Tom Tehan fighting for it, perhaps the future of the dairy industry would not be so rosy today. That was a mark of the character of the man. That was a mark of his courage. That is why his passing is such a great tragedy to all who knew him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To Tom's family, his children and his grandchildren, go our deepest sympathies. It is very hard to lose a loved one. It is hard even more so to lose a loved one who has devoted so much of their own life to the life of others because you feel that sometimes you may have wished you had more time with them. I can understand that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To Tom's family, all I can say is that his contribution to this place, to his community and to primary industry has meant a better future for many, many people. He will always be held in the greatest respect and the greatest esteem. I hope they will cherish that as much as their memories of their father and grandfather, to know that their lives were touched by a great man and that his contribution touched many others.</PARA></SPEECH>

However, Tom was clearly a man of my own heart in so far as he did not abandon his local community when he became a senator for Victoria. He remained a local and was always available to his local constituents. I know he took an active part in local issues affecting the Tatura and Kyabram region.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join my Senate colleagues in this condolence motion for former Senator Tom Tehan who served in this parliament between 1975 and 1978. We in the National Party appreciate the time set aside to be able to pause and reflect on the passing of one of our own. Understandably, as a now Victorian National Party senator, I knew Tom better than most. I can say that whatever political persuasion you may be you would have known the type of man he was because every party has such a person, needs such a person and certainly misses such a person in their passing&mdash;that is, a person who is loyal, principled and blessed with wisdom and wit and leads by sheer example. The deep fear with the passing of men like Tom Tehan is that they may never be replaced but the truth is they are. Tom replaced someone he learnt the trade from and I venture to say it was most likely his father, who was a founding member of the Country Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The funeral service in Kyabram was a very fine tribute to the man and his life. It brought together the best of church, a country town and a country party&mdash;all of which Tom Tehan served to the best of his talents. He served his church at the highest level as a Knight of Malta and with unflinching devotion. He <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1611"> served his town of Kyabram as a leading barrister and solicitor for some 50 years, taking up every cause possible on behalf of his rural consistency, particularly at a time when the rural community was bereft of true professionals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the people of Kyabram know only too well, there was no hospital board, no youth club, no elderly citizens committee, no chamber of commerce or any other community initiative that Tom Tehan was not a founding member of. The district's appreciation has been borne out by the stream of sympathy letters to the family since Tom's passing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He served his party as a Victorian senator and prior to this as party president. Moreover, it is little known that he was the personal solicitor and chief adviser to a former National Party leader John McEwen. Throughout Black Jack McEwen's very long reign, including his time as Prime Minister, he would often phone Tom for advice. Tom was very much one of the men who influenced the style and decisions of the National Party's icon&mdash;Jack McEwen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note that Tom's membership of the Country Party would probably have been considered against the tide of the times because, firstly, his professional status as a solicitor in a country town usually meant membership of the Liberal Party and, secondly, to be blunt, this was an era when Irish-Catholics did not naturally gravitate to the Country Party. But Tom could have done nothing else as he was a man of tradition. As said before, his father was a founding member of the Country Party some 76 years ago. Equally, his respect for John McEwen convinced him of the Country Party's good purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With this background, Tom Tehan entered politics anchored in Country Party philosophy. This was borne out in his first speech to the parliament, in which he laid down a few basic principles. I read directly from his maiden speech, which is self-explanatory. Firstly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But I do want to say this: Our long term objective is to prevent the growth of centralised bureaucratic domination in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>Secondly: </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I remind the Senate that this nation was built and developed by the exercising of individual initiative and ability and will only continue to prosper and develop under a private enterprise system.</PARA>
<PARA>Thirdly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From the time of Federation and before, the primary industries of Australia have been the backbone of the export trade of this country and have thus done a great deal in the economic field to develop the nation to its present stature.</PARA>
<PARA>If you thought the aforementioned were lofty and airy principles, not to be denied Tom understood some grassroots politics and a bit of parish pump. In his maiden speech he highlighted the very critical importance of and need for more funding for the Goulburn Valley driver training complex at Shepparton, which was then only a pilot scheme. His appeals to the Minister for Transport, Peter Nixon, also a National Party member, must have helped because today that complex is the largest in the southern hemisphere. Today it undertakes training of truck drivers, limousine drivers, security drivers and police, as well as enabling the complete instruction of teenagers between the ages of 14 and 18.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like so many who served their time in Old Parliament House, Tom would have had great difficulty switching up to the new Parliament House. The few of us who did serve in Old Parliament House know the great difference the shift made to the style and how that has affected today's politics. While today it may be a more professional and information driven style of politics, it is certainly less reflective and, maybe in Tom's eyes, less principled with far too much pragmatism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I offer my condolences to Tom's widow, Nance, and to his children: Terry, Maree, Ann and Maureen. As a final tribute, I seek the leave of the Senate to incorporate a poem written and read at the service by his granddaughter Genevieve.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to express my condolences and deep regret at the passing of former Senator Tom Tehan earlier this month at the age of 80. Former Senator Tehan and I actually came into the parliament at the same time. We had two things in common. One was that we came into the parliament at the same time, in 1975. He, of course, came into the Senate for the National Party, but he did come in with me and now Senator Baume and Senator Chapman. They both came into the parliament for the first time then as well, though in the House of Representatives. We did have a common bond there in terms of the commencement of our parliamentary service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had a second common bond with him in that he was a product and child of the Goulburn Valley. I am a child of the Goulburn Valley. I moved from it at an earlier age. The Goulburn Valley is a beautiful, wonderful and very important part of Victoria. One of the great things Tom Tehan did, not just in this parliament in the all&hyphen;too&hyphen;brief time he was here but I think throughout his life, was make people aware of the importance of the valley in the whole range of things for which it is important, particularly the various rural industries for which it has been so famous. It has undergone difficulties and adjustment <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> problems over many years, but it has tackled them very successfully.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tom Tehan's life was one of service to his community in the Goulburn Valley in a whole range of ways, as has already been said: through the law, through his work with industry and through the very wide range of community services with which his name is and will always be associated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">His contribution in the three all-too-brief years that he was here was an important one. He did a lot of work in the area of parliamentary committees&mdash;not just Senate committees but also committees of the joint parties&mdash;during the first three years of the Fraser government. One only has to have a look at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> index of those years under `Tehan' to see the very wide range of contributions he made. He was a very rounded man and his interests were wide ranging.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was, as my National Party colleagues have said, a great pillar of the National Party over many years&mdash;originally the Country Party and subsequently the National Party. I express my sympathy to all members of the National Party on the loss of Tom Tehan, but he is lost to us all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well as being a great National Party figure, I think he was also a great coalitionist. His relationship with us in the Liberal Party in many ways was as strong or almost as strong as the relationship he had with his own National Party colleagues. During those years that he was in parliament, and I know in some of the succeeding years, from time to time when we had some tensions arise between coalition partners Tom was always a very healing influence and had an influence in bringing together. I think certainly we in the coalition will miss him. From the comments I have heard from members of the other side on many occasions, I am sure that they too felt very much towards him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was said earlier that he was a man of integrity and great warmth. I think they are words that very much do sum up Tom Tehan and his life. Those of us who were fortunate enough to have had the privilege of knowing him are very saddened by his passing.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose the appropriate subtitle for my contribution in leading this debate today is `Six steps of dishonesty and deceit.' Last week, via a surprise press release from the Treasurer, Mr Costello, we had the announcement of a proposed new tax&mdash;a $1.2 billion tax&mdash;by removing the sales tax exemption on states, territories and local government. It was conveyed via that press release as a fait accompli to the states. This was a decision <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> obviously not taken by the Treasurer, Mr Costello, alone. It was a decision taken by the new government&mdash;barely three months old. It was taken by cabinet as a whole. The backbench of the government is very concerned about it. It was taken by cabinet, and by a Prime Minister who likes to refer to himself as Honest John Howard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decision announced by the Costello press release was in fact a repudiation of a number of commitments given by the government prior to the election. It is not just I who asserts that it was a repudiation of promises and commitments given prior to the election. The Treasurer of Victoria, Mr Stockdale, in a wide&hyphen;ranging interview, said, amongst other things, that this was a very black day for the new federal government. He said the new government had said they would keep their election promises, and that John Howard had said that he would honour his commitments. Mr Stockdale said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . and here he's broken no less than five commitments, two election promises&mdash;no tax increases; this is a tax increase&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>He went on in stronger terms when he referred to the proposed agreement in respect of the slightly more than $600 million in general purpose grants by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So the States will be $600 million worse off if this agreement were to be implemented, and that is a flagrant repudiation of not only his election commitments, but the agreement . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think what we're seeing here is a very bad start by the new Howard government, that they're repudiating fundamental election commitments, they're doing more damage to State taxpayers than even Keating did . . . </PARA>
<PARA>During question time today I referred to the commitment given by the now Treasurer, Mr Costello, last year at the National Press Club. I referred to a statement made by the now Assistant Treasurer, Senator Jim Short, making it very clear that there would be no increase in existing taxes and no expansion of existing taxation. Yet last week we had a proposal to increase taxes&mdash;$1.2 billion worth of taxes&mdash;on just about everything that state, territory and local governments are currently exempt from.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1618">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What was the excuse given? Interestingly, in the press release by Treasurer Costello the main emphasis was on alleged rorts in respect of car purchases by state governments and other authorities. This alleged rort was merely an excuse to remove sales tax exemption on libraries, schools, art  galleries, Meals on Wheels, marine boards, councils, public transport and child&hyphen;care centres operated by local government, to name just a few. The types of articles that would have had their sales tax removed include stationery, videos, computers, photocopiers, books and medical equipment. The list goes on and on. That was the first stage of the deceit and deception.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second part of the dishonesty of this deception by an arrogant and out of touch Treasurer was in respect of the alleged rorts in the area of motor vehicles. Treasurer Costello put great emphasis on this issue in his ABC radio interview with <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS>. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we won't allow rorting in the tax system . . . A government that finds rorting shouldn't stand around and say, `Oh, we'll let that go unchecked.'</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . .. to stop rorting and to have transparency in the tax system, governments shouldn't make themselves immune from each other's taxes.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on and on about alleged rorts in the tax system. In addition to this proposed $1.2 billion tax being a direct contradiction of promises made prior to the election, it is interesting that, if it was such a big rort, why didn't the now government include it in their list of funding commitments in respect of the last election? The coalition went into some detail about how they were going to fund their election promises. In the document <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meeting our commitments</EMPHASIS>  there is no mention of sales tax rorts on cars. This $1.2 billion proposal was simply a wilful breaking of election commitments in order to meet the extravagant election promises that the coalition now finds itself having great trouble funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just to compound the errors of the Treasurer, he made a significant error when he claimed in that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM </EMPHASIS>interview of 12 June that Telstra can buy its cars sales tax free. That was a totally untrue claim. So we have an <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> example of the incompetence of the new Treasurer as well as the dishonesty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third step in this dishonesty and deceit was to hold, some have said, a sledgehammer&mdash;I would have said, more appropriately, a steamroller&mdash;over the states by trying to argue that the three-year agreement with the states to maintain general purpose payments was somehow negotiable in the context of this proposed $1.2 billion, when agreement had already been reached with the states and Treasurer Costello was trying to use it as a lever in order to get the states to agree. Again, Treasurer Stockdale from Victoria referred to this in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM </EMPHASIS>interview when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So the States will be $600 million worse off if this agreement were to be implemented . . . </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . .. the $619 million of grants&mdash;they are the second instalment of a three-year agreement which was finalised at last years' Premiers Conference.</PARA>
<PARA>So Mr Costello was essentially repudiating the agreement made only 12 months ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth level of dishonesty in the new government's approach was the breaching of their commitment on cooperative federalism. Prior to the last election the Liberal Party promised that there would be consultation and discussion with their state colleagues. There was no advance warning or discussion about this new proposal. They were universally condemned by state leaders. In fact, the Treasurer, and now Premier, of my own state, Mr Rundle, said, `Peter Costello's only been there a dog&hyphen;watch but in that short time he's making Labor treasurers Willis and Dawkins look good.' That was the fourth area of dishonesty and deceit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fifth area of dishonesty and deceit was the outcome of the Premiers Conference, which the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Short, tried to outline in question time today. There will be various flow-on effects to the states. The states have already announced that there will be increases in taxes and charges and/or a combination of cuts. I see Senator Gibson in the chamber. I remind him of the possible outcomes in Tasmania.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1619">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the beginning of last week the Liberal leaders were looking forward to the Premiers Conference. They thought it was going to be a great show. The only great show they got turned out to be a great dog show. We had the peeved premiers letting loose against Peter Costello, who had been let off the leash. They were like dogs devouring each other in the media, trying to abuse each other. Senator Short smiles, but I am sure Treasurer Costello was not smiling last week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final area of dishonesty and deceit was that the Liberals want to introduce a goods and services tax. This is the beginning of the first step towards that. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

I suppose I have to give him full marks for the strength of the nerve and hypocrisy that he brings with him to this chamber in accusing the coalition government of breaking its election commitment of no new taxes. This is an example of the pot calling the kettle black par excellence. I will come back to that later in my remarks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Sherry is wrong in the whole basis of his MPI today. It is a fact that nothing this government has done and nothing the Treasurer (Mr Costello) or anyone else has done has in any way broken the election commitment of no new taxes. It has become a bit of a regular event that each sitting week Senator Sherry comes into this place&mdash;a bit like Chicken Little&mdash;calls an MPI and claims that the sky is falling in. His last MPI was concerning our so-called ideological fetish with cutting expenditure. The only thing ideological about what is going on is the absolute ideological refusal of the Labor Party to face up to the need for this nation to balance its books&mdash;books which were absolutely devastated through 13 years of fiscal vandalism by previous Labor governments. The last MPI <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> was about our so-called ideological fetish with budget restraint. This time it is about our alleged broken promise, broken commitment, that there will be no new taxes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once again Senator Sherry is wrong. He is wrong to characterise the sales tax measures contained in the Commonwealth's offer last week to the states as a government breaking its tax promises. We do not resile one iota from the Treasurer's statement on 1 June that the removal of sales tax exemptions for all levels of government would remove a range of anomalies, inequities and distortions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I see Senator Wheelwright is following Senator Sherry in this debate. I hope that if he does not believe that the sales tax arrangements, so far as they apply to government, in fact give government an unfair advantage compared with their private sector competitors in the area of business, if he does not believe that they do give rise to various rorts of the system, which are publicly identified&mdash;I would not want to overstate them, but they are definitely there&mdash;if he does not believe that they are anomalous and inequitable in the overall sense of a proper public policy taxation system, he will get up here and say so today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Sherry certainly did not. Perhaps Senator Wheelwright might, although even then I am not sure what one would read into that, given the massive division, disruption and infighting going on at the moment within the ranks of the Labor Party in terms of ideology. On one hand there is Senator Wheelwright and on the other is Senator Carr. I do not know where Senator Ray is, but I think he is pulling all the strings. Then there is poor old Senator Faulkner sitting here as the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, leader of the Left; he does not have a clue which way he is supposed to go. He will wait like a puppet on a string until all the strings are pulled by the heavyweights around the place, and he will be told what is or is not a good thing to do in terms of taxation reform or budget management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is certainly a fact that the removal of sales tax exemptions for government would remove a range of anomalies, inequities and distortions. We do not resile from that, nor do <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1620"> we resile from the fact that the outcome of the Premiers Conference last week, in that sense, produced only a partial tackling of that area of concern. The basic reason for the Premiers Conference proposals of last week, so far as the coalition was concerned, was to come up with a major contribution made by the states and territories in a responsible, cooperative manner to assist the funding and reduction of the $8,000 million deficit that the Howard government inherited from the Keating government when it went out of office on 2 March.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, one of the leading architects in that destruction of the integrity of the Commonwealth's finances was none other than the then Minister for Finance, now the Leader of the Opposition in this parliament, Mr Beazley. If anyone in this present parliament carries the main burden of the blame for what happened to the Commonwealth's finances in the last two or three years, it is surely the Leader of the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The opposition, when in government, knew about the anomalies but sought to do nothing at all about them&mdash;just as was the case with most of their period of office. They knew, I hope, on occasions, the right thing to do, yet they refused time and time again to grasp the nettle and take some of those decisions&mdash;not always palatable or easy decisions&mdash;that would make our tax system a fairer system and make Australia, as a result of it, a better place in which to live.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An outcome of the Premiers Conference was to limit the removal of the sales tax exemption where governments provide cars as part of remuneration packages to public servants. It is good that that has happened. I hope that the opposition and the Democrats&mdash;I see Senator Spindler here; I have always thought of him as an honourable man in terms of his wishes for a fair and equitable tax system&mdash;would agree that that was a correct public policy point to aim for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has said, part of the outcome of the Premiers Conference saw the good tax policy measures that were proposed by the coalition last year partly wound back. We do not deny that. The Prime Minister did not resile from the original <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> proposal being good policy, nor did the Treasurer. I am certainly not going to do so now, because we all know that it was good policy. Nevertheless, as I said in question time many times today, the overall outcome of the Premiers Conference was an exceedingly good result for the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The key outcome of the Premiers Conference from the Commonwealth's perspective is that the states have agreed to make a substantial contribution towards the task of restoring the Commonwealth budget to balance. It is a balance that has been thrown completely out of kilter by the mismanagement and irresponsibility of the previous Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The states recognise that the government faces a big fiscal task, which is not the result of the actions of the coalition but rather a reflection of the total fiscal mismanagement of the former Labor government. The states recognise that, in order to fix the problems that we inherited from Labor, the government has to make a lot of tough decisions that we would prefer not to have to make. We are not masochists. We are not political masochists or economic masochists or anything of that nature. What we want to do, though, and we have a responsibility on behalf of the Australian people to do so, is to restore the finances of this nation to proper balance so that we can grow, prosper, create more jobs, reduce unemployment and lower the amount of public debt, and, therefore, the amount of taxes that have to be spent simply on meeting the interest payments on government debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last four years alone, five years perhaps, the debt of the Commonwealth government has gone up fourfold. That is monstrous, particularly when throughout most of that period we have had economic growth. We should have been running surpluses rather than deficits. But what did we find? We found a Labor government which in that time allowed the debt to escalate fourfold. The impact of that on the interest burden of the budget is enormous, and the interest paid on the debt of the Commonwealth, in the books of the annual budget, is now one of the highest of all items of expenditure.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1621">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is bad policy. It is bad economics. It is very bad economic management. It is&mdash;I can say this without hesitation&mdash;nothing more than economic vandalism. The states recognise that, just as the new Commonwealth government did.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are very pleased indeed and have welcomed the fact that the states recognise the need for them to make a contribution to fixing that budget black hole that we inherited from Labor. Payments to the states are a sizeable component of total outlays. It would have been quite  unrealistic to quarantine the states&mdash;and they appreciate this&mdash;from the deficit reduction process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are very happy with the final outcome, which we achieved through negotiation. I stress the word `negotiation', because if we are really serious about having a meaningful relationship between Commonwealth and state and territory governments, it can be done only in the sense of people being prepared to get around a table and negotiate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that your starting position is not always the position that you finish with is absolutely irrelevant. If it were always the case, then the word `negotiation' and the whole concept of conference would have really no meaning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we finished up with an agreement by the states to, in full cooperation, make a substantial contribution to the Commonwealth's funding problem over the next three years. That is extremely useful, as is the agreement to remove the exemption from sales tax applying to general purpose road vehicles provided wholly or partly for private use as part of a remuneration package by governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We did not roll over at the Premiers Conference. We did not break any promises at the Premiers Conference. We listened to the premiers, because we think that they have a total right to be heard, something that the former Labor government never, ever believed in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is amusing to me in the extreme that Senator Sherry would get it so wrong, yet again; broken promises and tax increases are something about which Labor has intricate <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> knowledge. Let me remind the chamber of Labor's top 10 chart busting broken promises when they were in government. No. 10, to maintain the Public Service. What happened? Between 1993 and 1995, the last two to three years of Labor, there was a 2&half; per cent reduction in Public Service numbers. Jobs were set to disappear again between 1996 and 1997 under Labor's plan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No. 9, to maintain majority Australian ownership of Qantas. No. 8, to maintain 51 per cent equity in the Commonwealth Bank. No. 7, to reduce unemployment. Yet the number of people on unemployment benefits is higher now than during the depths of the so-called recession that we had to have. It is higher by a figure of 61,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No. 6, to increase spending on Aboriginal health, did not happen. No. 5, to remove all age pensions from the tax system by 1995, did not happen. No. 4, to match the Christmas appeal funds raised by charitable institutions, did not happen. No. 3 was that there were to be no tax increases. What happened? A whole raft of wholesale sales taxes and others spiralled up under Labor. No. 2, to produce self-repairing budgets with a deficit reduction program, was a sad and sick joke. We finished up with Mr Beazley's $8 billion black hole. The daddy of them all, No. 1 of the chart busters, was to provide the l-a-w law cuts. They knew when they made that promise just prior to the 1993 election that they would never keep it. Senator Sherry's proposed matter of public importance is a mass of hypocrisy. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be very happy to pick up some of the points that Senator Short made. This debate on the matter of public importance seeks to highlight one of the election commitments breached by Mr Costello and Mr Howard during last year's Premiers Conference: namely, the promise not to increase existing taxes or introduce new taxes by proposing a new $1.2 billion Costello sales tax on the states, territories and local governments. According to Mr Alan Stockdale, the Liberal Treasurer of Victoria, Mr Costello had breached no fewer than five separate commitments. </PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1622">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me advert to the requests made by Senator Short: namely, the Democrats should wholeheartedly support the plugging of the rorts that are no doubt inherent in this system of sales tax on cars that are provided to public servants and executives. This measure goes well beyond the mere plugging of rorts: it devolves a responsibility of the Commonwealth onto the states. It is merely a shuffling of responsibilities, responsibilities which the Commonwealth government does not want to be seen as having cut in terms of the services provided by the states. It dearly wants to collect the money without taking the blame.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Sherry, who proposed this matter of public importance, knows full well that Labor in government were the past masters of shifting their budgetary problems onto the states. Between 1985 and 1992, the Hawke and Keating governments cut grants to the states in real terms by 19 per cent with a further cut last year. These cuts were partly responsible for the states having to cut over 150,000 jobs in the state public sector and to increase taxes in a wide range of areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats have been a little astounded, I must say, by Mr Costello's definitional gymnastics in recent months about what is or is not a rise in tax. A tariff, we have been told, is a tariff, not a tax. A rise in HECS is a rise in HECS, not a rise in tax on graduates as Senator Vanstone asserted only last year. Now we are told that adding a $1.2 billion tax impost on the states is an attack on rorts and not a rise of $1.2 billion in tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Costello's arguments were rejected in very strong terms last week by his state colleagues, who correctly pointed out that his tax grab on the states was an attack on services. But then, this government does not seem to be particularly interested in the impact on the Australian people of its pursuit of the $8 billion budget cuts. Mr Howard and Mr Costello conveniently ignore the fact that the $8 billion cuts are not necessary in economic terms. We all know now that they are in fact based on very rubbery economic growth forecasts, which have already been stretched. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They ignore the fact that $8 billion worth of cuts will hurt an awful lot of Australians <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> through higher charges and lower services. They ignore the impact on the unemployed and the advice of some of Australia's most senior economists such as Fred Argy, John Neville, Fred Gruen and John Quiggin. All that matters is the glowing praise of the financial markets for delivering $8 billion worth of cuts, whether they can be justified in economic terms or not. So Mr Costello and Mr Howard got their $1.5 billion worth of expenditure cuts over the years from the states. The CPSU has estimated that it will mean another 90,000 jobs gone over the next three years or it will mean the states and local authorities will have to increase taxes and charges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other interesting thing about Mr Costello's astonishing performance last week was his newfound interest in tax rorts. He said that it was the main reason why he would wish to introduce this particular measure. The Democrats believe that there are many areas in tax rorts where Mr Costello could have made a start and many areas where the Democrats would wholeheartedly support him. An article in last weekend's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, written by Mike Steketee, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Keating government announced that it was going to collect $800 million in tax from 100 of the wealthiest Australians who put money through trusts, the advice from the tax office was that 80 of them had assets valued at more than $30 million each but had reported taxable incomes of $20,000 or less.</PARA>
<PARA>It is perhaps also important to quote a statement made by Michael Carmody, the tax commissioner. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Put simply, it is difficult to expect the general community to meet their tax responsibilities if they see some high&hyphen;wealth individuals paying little or no tax.</PARA>
<PARA>The Democrats welcome Mr Costello's newfound interest in tax rorts but we would like him to attack some other areas which are well and truly on the record, such as the ones I have quoted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We accept that some budget deficit repair will be needed in this year's budget. Labor's unfunded tax cuts and unfunded Working Nation program make this necessary. But we encourage the government to take the advice of Dr Vince FitzGerald in his national savings <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1623"> report, and the suggestion by former EPAC chief Fred Argy that the opportunity for deficit reduction should be used to repair the holes in the revenue base. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Acting Deputy President, I am quite happy to rise in support of Senator Sherry's proposed matter of public importance, particularly as it refers to the coalition government's wilful breaking of promises in relation to taxation in the announcements at the Premiers Conference last week. The first extraordinary thing to occur last week was the great clarion call for microeconomic reform. Last Tuesday, the Treasurer, Mr Costello, came out all hairy&hyphen;chested, saying what he was going to do. He was going to demonstrate his competence and courage over microeconomic reform, and his statement on Tuesday was to be the basis for the proposal he was putting to the states. I say `proposal' but I should really say `announcement', which is a distinction that Senator Short was unable to make in question time today. I will read from the announcement issued by the Treasurer:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The removal of sales tax exemptions for government represents a very important microeconomic and taxation system reform. It will remove inequities and distortions, including the growing abuse of the sales tax exemption by some public sector bodies. Further, it will remove an unfair advantage that many public sector businesses have over private sector competitors who are subject to wholesale sales tax.</PARA>
<PARA>That announcement was made last Tuesday and it came out in the style characteristic of Mr Costello. Unfortunately, I cannot quite do his swagger. I do not really need to because a large number of Australians saw his posturing on their television screens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The announcement, which was drafted by the Treasury, was in relatively sedate language, but the Treasurer was pleased to go further than that in his press conference. He referred to the `unfair advantage' over the private sector and the encouragement for `rorting of the system'. He said that the removal of the sales tax was a `bold move' along the path to microeconomic reform. That was the sort of atmosphere in which these proposals were announced.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been heartened by some of the reporting of this matter. People started to become concerned about what might happen at the Premiers Conference and whether the Treasurer might experience some sort of backlash. In response, the Treasurer is reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . `I've never seen a Premiers' Conference yet where they haven't said the world will fall in. And you know what happens, after the Premiers' Conference is over: the sun comes up, as it always did'.</PARA>
<PARA>That was the picture of the Treasurer last Tuesday and Wednesday. But we are all very much indebted to Mr John Short who, by probably trying to qualify for this year's Walkley Award, gave us the real details of how these negotiations took place. He gave us the behind the scenes story of exactly how this bold microeconomic reform was transacted. I read from his article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  of last Saturday:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The high drama of the opening day of the premiers' conference on Thursday over the attempt by the federal Treasurer, Mr Costello, to hit the States with a $1.2 billion sales tax bill was replaced yesterday by high farce.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The premiers left the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, and his Treasurer on Thursday night with an offer that would have seen substantial cuts in federal grants to fund general services in return for Mr Costello's sales tax bill being sliced back to $100 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The States' offer was to apply for two years to help the Commonwealth deliver a balanced Budget in 1997&hyphen;98.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Howard then made a counter&hyphen;offer which would have seen the States' generous offer being effectively extended for another six months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of the premiers were of the view that the Prime Minister had said that if they accepted this new version, then they would have a deal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">So, when they arrived at Parliament House&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>on Friday&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">for a scheduled 9.30am meeting, they were expecting that a deal would be quickly done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">After about a 30&hyphen;minute delay, the premiers were called to a meeting at which Mr Howard made clear that his Thursday night counter&hyphen;offer had been withdrawn. All treasurers&mdash;federal and State&mdash;had been excluded from this meeting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The premiers were then in a state of confusion, with conflicting recollections as to whether the Prime Minister had reverted to the first Common <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1624"> wealth counter&hyphen;offer, which had been placed on the table for discussion after lunch on Thursday.</PARA>
<PARA>There they all were, trying to work out what on earth the government was doing. They had put forward a proposal, received a counter offer from the government, then all of a sudden, having said it was accepted, it was promptly withdrawn. The article continues by reporting that the premiers:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . then adjourned for one of the many cups of tea the Prime Minister was keen to offer whenever the conference reached what appeared to be a bitter impasse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It therefore came as a complete surprise to the premiers when they were subsequently called back by Mr Howard to then be told that the Thursday night counter&hyphen;offer was not only still alive but was on the table ready to be signed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The premiers were also surprised to find that Mr Costello was again absent from this meeting&mdash;although Mr Howard said publicly later that too much should not be read into the Treasurer's absence. . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is what happened to that bold proposal for microeconomic reform. It disappeared into a shambles of negotiations and cross&hyphen;negotiations involving state party colleagues in an attempt to get a monetary outcome with which everyone could live. Microeconomic reform lasted about 36 hours in the breast of the Treasurer; then he had his nose put out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Spindler mentioned some of the reactions of the state premiers to the conference. I would love to go through all of them but my favourite is reported as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the privately expressed understatement of Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett, it was the most amateurish shambles he had ever attended.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not often agree with the Premier of Victoria but, from everything I have seen and read about that meeting, his statement really sums it up. I could go through the statements made by Western Australian Premier Richard Court and South Australian Premier Dean Brown, the very strong statements made by the Victorian Treasurer Mr Alan Stockdale, and statements made by Tasmanian Premier Tony Rundle, but best of all was the statement made by Mr Rob Borbidge, the Premier of Queensland. It bears repeating because, apart from saying that he found Mr Costello's <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> actions `appalling, arrogant and disgraceful', he is reported as further saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"I mean if they want to cut payments to the States, why don't they just say so instead of this two card trick that we've seen which is right out of amateur hour . . . </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Did he set out to cause massive financial problems for organisations like Guide Dogs for the Blind?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Did he set out to make drought&hyphen;declared local&hyphen;authority areas in Queensland bankrupt? Because that's the bottom line of what he's proposing."</PARA>
<PARA>The report of Mr Borbidge's remarks continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"I wouldn't expect a lawyer from the leafy suburbs of Melbourne to know the meaning of drought," he said.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>I could hardly equal the words of Mr Borbidge in these matters. It is all the more telling that these words do not come from members of the Labor Party or from anyone else except their party colleagues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What it means for New South Wales is a $902 million hole in the budget. It is a budget that was put out with a modest surplus recently and was very well received by the financial markets. Where does the government think the money for this is going to come from? Of course it is going to have to come from increased taxes. Services have been absolutely ground to the bone. What is Mr Costello's response to the Australian public going to be? He will say, `Don't blame me. Blame the states. I didn't do it, Dad. It was the boogieman. I didn't eat all the biscuits, even though I've got chocolate all around my lips. It was this mysterious boogieman.' How simple-minded do they really think the Australian people are? Do they really think that they will not see through this sham?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What have we got out of all this exercise? No microeconomic reform and increasing pressure on inflation. Remember inflation, about which the government has no policy. There is increasing pressure on inflation through an increase in car prices. At the same time, we have no fundamental reform. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

We felt able to make this commitment because the former Labor government, and in particular the former Labor Minister for Finance, Mr Beazley, deliberately and with cold calculation told the Australian people that the Commonwealth budget was in surplus&mdash;that it was in the black&mdash;and that there was no reason to believe otherwise. In making this statement, he said that he relied on estimates by Treasury and the Department of Finance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, just one day after the election, Treasury and the Department of Finance provided a detailed briefing to the new government which showed that there was an $8 billion deficit in the offing over the next two financial years if no rectifying action were taken. This briefing showed that the current 1995-96 financial year budget was not in surplus. We published the Treasury estimates, which showed that this financial year the government was running an underlying deficit of $9 billion. More importantly, looking forward for the next two years, instead of a genuine underlying surplus, we were looking at a deficit which had to be met by a further $8 billion. In other words, it was the Beazley $8 billion black hole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government, including Mr Beazley, should have told the truth to the Australian people before the election. The Australian people deserved to know that information. That is why we have made a commitment that that will not happen again. We are committed to a charter for budget honesty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This MPI is about tax increases by governments. It raises this fundamental question: why would any government want to raise additional money from its citizens? To put it another way, why would any government want to impose greater burdens on its people, particularly if it is obvious that those imposts will hurt electorally? Surely the government is not masochistic. The fundamental reason is that we found the  finances of the Commonwealth government to be in a mess as a result <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of profligate spending by the Labor government, particularly over the last five years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This point has basically been recognised. Even Premier Carr of the New South Wales government, the last Labor leader in the country, has acknowledged the dimension of the problem which now confronts Australia. By his action, in preferring a reduction in state grants over the re&hyphen;organisation of tax structures, Premier Carr has tacitly said to the people of his state and the people of Australia that the Commonwealth finances are in a mess.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How big a mess are those finances in? Let us step back a bit and see what has happened in the past. For the four years from 1987-88 to 1990&hyphen;91, the Commonwealth government ran a budget surplus which peaked at 2.2 per cent of GDP. If a similar surplus were being run today, that number would be the equivalent of about $12 billion next year. Unfortunately, from 1991-92 onwards, the Commonwealth began spending a lot more than it raised. Over the next five years, including the estimate for this current financial year, the Commonwealth spent $49 billion more than it raised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the past five years, Commonwealth outlays have risen from $102 billion at the start of the period to an estimate for this year of $122.9 billion, which is an increase of nearly 20 per cent. Over the same time, Commonwealth revenue&mdash;that is, taxes and charges from citizens&mdash;increased from $93.3 billion five years ago to the current estimate this year of $122.7 billion, which is an increase of 31.5 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor went out and borrowed and spent that much as well. At 30 June 1991, the Commonwealth securities on issue were $34 billion. That is a Commonwealth debt of $34 billion. The forecast for the end of this financial year is $100 billion. That is an enormous increase in borrowings. They spent all that as well. Interest on that debt has skyrocketed. Gross interest on public interest debt for the Commonwealth has risen from $3.9 billion in 1991&hyphen;92 to an estimated $9.4 billion for this current financial year, which is a huge increase. The proportion of Commonwealth outlays paid in interest on debt has gone from <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1626"> 5.5 per cent of the budget to over 8 per cent of the budget this year. So the Labor Party has incurred debt. With interest payments now being a significant proportion of the Commonwealth budget, that money cannot be spent elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will now deal with the debt servicing ratio. From 30 June 1991 to June 1995, government securities on issue as a proportion of GDP have risen from 12.9 per cent to 23.3 per cent. Interest on those securities has risen from 1.5 to 2.1 per cent. While all this debt was being increased, Labor also went ahead and sold assets. During that same period, the total value of assets sold by the Commonwealth amounted to $8.7 billion. That has also been spent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, over the past five years the former Labor government spent, spent and spent. It also taxed, taxed and taxed some more. It sold assets. It ran down the infrastructure. It stopped investing. It dropped infrastructure investment from $3.4 billion in 1991-92 to an estimated negative $3.5 billion this current financial year. So it increased taxes; it borrowed very heavily; it sold off assets; and it stopped investing. It could not go on; hence, the $8 billion black hole.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the basis of statements from Labor spokesmen, it is clear that their prescription to this dire situation is more of the same&mdash;turn a blind eye and wait for growth and hope.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The time has come to change the direction of our national economy. The winds of change are about, and the coalition will take the necessary decisions to put our national <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> finances on a footing that will provide the opportunity for long-term and sustainable growth. We have to have savings as a top priority in this country. Who has been the worst culprit with regard to savings? The Commonwealth government has been by running deficits. The Commonwealth government has to get into genuine surpluses, as used to happen many years ago. They did even just five years ago. If the Commonwealth were running genuine surpluses, that would take pressure off the current account. It would also take pressure off interest rates and, hence, encourage investment and job opportunities for our children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By the coalition facing up to taking hard decisions, it will mean we will not always be popular with all of the Australian people. We know that and accept it, but there is no alternative; there is no option if we are to be responsible. For the past five years, the opposition on the other side put their collective heads in the sand and, ultimately, the Australian people gave them the kick that they richly deserved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This MPI merely draws attention again to the failings of the previous government. They let the Australian people down and, furthermore, even since the election they have held up the mandate which we have been given by the Australian people to put through the key pieces of legislation: the industrial relations legislation and also the environmental legislation and the Telstra package. They deserve to be condemned for their actions.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government is confirming the worst fears of many who watched their rise to power. When I heard that the government planned to devolve responsibility for a number of areas to the states, I suspected that the agenda was to give them these powers and cut funding for Commonwealth coordination functions, while not really giving the states any money to perform those functions themselves. The devolution will apparently occur in areas like regional development, local government, public housing, and aspects of health and education, including the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. All of these areas, it appears, will be generously given to the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1627"> states to administer, but that will be without the necessary funds to carry out the functions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The generosity of the federal government in relation to passing on funds for taking over these new functions becomes clear when we look at the proposition the federal government has made to the states on state funding. First we have the proposition to impose federal sales taxes on goods bought by state and local governments. After the premiers' revolt, we have an agreement in which apparently the full proposed taxes will not be imposed, in return for the states paying the Commonwealth a large cash repayment ahead of the due date for repayment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Either way, the states will be out of pocket by over a billion dollars, at a time when they will be taking on the new burden of administering new areas of responsibility. In other words, responsibility and costs will be transferred to the states while their grants are effectively reduced. It is a double blow, and the areas most likely to suffer are the areas being transferred. Of particular concern will be the proposed transfer of the administration of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, which is much more naturally handled through the federal system, which coordinates Medicare and the monitoring and classification of drugs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of state funding, the proposal is not a good one. It is another indication that the agenda for the Commonwealth is not efficiency; it is simply the elimination of large areas of government services to ensure that the existing revenue base will cover expenses. It is likely that this will lead to draconian service cuts by the states, which will then blame the federal government. It is also likely to lead to increased state-federal conflict and a reduction of accountability of government generally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It may also lead to revenge taxation of Commonwealth agencies, applying payroll tax, land and other taxes, and stamp duties. This will effectively reduce the real value of any budget measures, since a portion of them will be caught up in stupid and cyclic transfers between governments, rendering them unavailable. This government should have thought through the implications of its policy changes before it announced them.</PARA>

The coalition, which is now in government, made various promises. I would like to read from a statement the Prime Minister made to a dinner the Business Council held in Sydney on 26 March. He says, in part:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the reasons why the respect for our institutions has declined is the way in which promises are too freely made and even more freely repudiated after governments are elected to power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think part of the process of restoring trust and confidence in the process&mdash;the political process&mdash;is for governments to try to the best of their ability, and even beyond that if that's possible, to meet the commitments that they have made. And I have indicated to my colleagues and I have indicated publicly, and I will go on indicating it publicly that nobody should imagine that I will lightly accept any repudiation of the commitments that we made to people. And even more important than other benchmarks against which you are entitled to judge us, in three years time you will be entitled to judge us according to the benchmark of whether or not we have honoured commitments made to people and to the Australian nation before the 2nd of March because unless that stream of trust, that element of confidence, can be restored, then the whole respect of the community for the political process and for the process of government is going to further disintegrate.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>That is very true. It is a very good statement and I wish the Prime Minister would adhere to it. I would like to turn to the federal funding statements in coalition policy prior to the election, which read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Liberal and National Party government will maintain financial assistance grants for local government at a level at least as high as currently programmed.</PARA>
<PARA>That clearly is not the case. Mr Howard, again, made a statement last year following the budget introduced by the then Labor government. In respect of sales tax, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All of those taxes violate the pre&hyphen;election promises that were made by the Prime Minister and the government. All of them constitute straight electoral fraud and straight electoral dishonesty.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is why, when we come to government after the next election, we will introduce a charter of budget honesty which will not allow this to happen again.</PARA>
<PARA>He failed at the first hurdle&mdash;didn't even get to the first hurdle. If you do not think that you have not introduced new forms of taxes as a result of the removal of the sales tax exemption on motor vehicles to local government and state government, I do not know what you think you have done because, clearly, the loss will be borne by the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I go to some statements by local government mayors, I want to turn to a speech by the minister for local government to the Institute of Municipal Management in Canberra on 21 May 1996. The minister is Mr Warwick Smith, the reborn member for Bass, and it is going to be quite interesting to see what the people of Bass, after their rates have been increased by the government's new tax, think about Mr Smith in the long term.

<PARA>The minister talked about the local government development program and then said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The LGDP will be retained, although on a much reduced scale, with only those projects which are considered to enhance efficiency, productivity or service delivery being supported.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We take our election commitment seriously and the Prime Minister has already made that clear.

The Budget is to be delivered on <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> August 20. While there will be a normal revenue of funding as provided for under the legislation, the Government does not intend to review at this stage the fundamentals underpinning the program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The minister went on to talk about economic reform and said: One area in which the Commonwealth is keen to both consult yet also cajole is the area of greater efficiency in local government.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say that they would develop a memorandum of understanding which, among other things, will hopefully bring about greater efficiency. The following paragraph is particularly important. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is going to require the development and publication of a wide range of indicators of the performance of individual Councils. I should say here that with the development of performance indicators, we are expecting no more of Local Government than is being required of the Commonwealth and States.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know what you did with regard to the sales tax exemption on cars but I do not know that you are removing it from Commonwealth cars. It will be very interesting to see whether or not you do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to refer to some of the comments by local mayors in Tasmania, my home state. They have all said, bar none, that the removal of these sales tax exemptions will lead to rate increases. If that is not about introducing new taxes, I do not know what is. Of course, the Liberal Premier in my state has said that he is going to introduce a Costello levy. If that is not a tax on the ordinary people of this country&mdash;a tax that you said you would not introduce&mdash;I do not know what is.

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">Executive Summary</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Officer Education: The Military After Next</EMPHASIS> , was tabled on 23 October 1995. The Joint Standing Committee's inquiry arose as a consequence of the issue of the provision of academic studies and professional military education to officer cadets and officers of the Australian Defence Force (ADF) being referred by the Minister for Defence on 22 June 1993. This referral by the Minister closely followed the completion of the Program Evaluation of the Australian Defence Force Academy (henceforth referred to as the `Academy') by the Inspector-General in December 1992. Terms of Reference for the Committee inquiry are at Appendix A, and membership of the Defence Sub-Committee is at Appendix B.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee attempted to ascertain whether the existing system of officer development `remains adequate for preparing officers who will encounter a fundamentally different set of global, regional and national security arrangements'.1 These changed environmental factors are embodied in the concept of the `military after next'.2 Defence has accepted this concept as a most useful tool in the formulation of strategic policy and future architecture for the ADF's professional military development and academic education of its officer corps. It is noted that, whilst the Terms of Reference limited the inquiry and the subsequent report to the provision of academic education and professional military studies at nine Defence colleges, the system of professional military development and academic education of officers is not limited to these nine colleges.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Four key themes are evident in the Report: the role of the ADF in the next century; the cost of educating and training officers at various points in their careers; the `closed' societal system represented by officer education within the Academy, and the need for greater effort by Defence to create a `total <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> force' by enhancing `jointery', integration of regular and reserve forces, and closer collaboration between military personnel and civilians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Response has been prepared by an ADF Working Party consisting of representatives from Headquarters ADF, Department of Defence, the single Services and both the University College and Military Component of the Defence Academy.

Captains and Majors are at different points on the professional development continuum; Captains are involved in high skill orientated tasks whilst Majors are more heavily involved with indirect command, leadership and management.

Professional military development training is closely related to job requirements. The ADF systems approach to training ensures that training is derived directly from job requirements using precision <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> occupational analysis methods, and is accurately targeted at specific task performance. Likewise, the training system ensures that, for junior officer training, there is an effective balance between professional military development and specialist military (war-fighting) skills. The joint war-fighting skills of various specialisations are met by the provision of role-specific courses. The demands of learning single Service operational and war-fighting skills dominate training requirements for junior officers in all three Services. Whilst the need for joint war-fighting skills varies between specialisations, nevertheless, the respective Services effectively meet all joint training requirements. The continued maintenance of an adequate level of joint training can be assured through the application of normal training processes. In addition, the Chiefs of Staff Committee periodically review the overall structure of the professional military development continuum in order to ensure that the blend of tactical and operational training requirements for all officers remains appropriate for the command and operational environment of the ADF. Defence will include in its strategic review of officer professional military development, an analysis of any further scope for broader general `jointery' training for junior officers beyond individual specialisation, category or corps requirements. As a consequence, the establishment of a separate dedicated review, as proposed in this recommendation, is not justified nor would such a review be consistent with the holistic approach proposed by Defence.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Defence does not support the adoption of the Committee's proposal to terminate undergraduate education at the Academy. The Report lacks substantive and sufficiently detailed reasoning to justify such a proposal. To accept it would involve the abandoning of a system in which both the Australian Defence Force and University of New South Wales have made a significant investment, and which is known to provide a high quality product, in favour of an alternative with an untested capacity to meet the quantitative and qualitative needs of Defence. Termination of the undergraduate program at the Academy would remove 1000 places from the higher education system. To maintain current levels of opportunity for university studies in Australia through provision of equivalent additional places in other institutions within the National Unified System would cost $10 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's proposal is not based on any perceived military or academic deficiencies but on the perception that `an education at ADFA may not be an appropriate mechanism for integrating officer cadets with the community they are going to serve'.3 There are significant advantages for Defence in retaining undergraduate education at the Academy:</PARA>

It is also mindful of the cost of such education and the importance of relative costings in the likely continued environment of highly constrained defence budgets.

Defence intends to initiate a review of its officer education and professional military studies system (as discussed in the responses to Recommendations 1 and 13). This review will consider the likely impact of sociological, technological and strategic changes over the next 15-20 years on the relative effectiveness of the various recruitment and officer training schemes, including the Academy.

There is no clear indication that the proposed scheme would be either as workable or successful as postulated by the Report. Indeed, it would appear that the proposed scheme sacrifices many of the synergistic advantages of a single institution such as the Academy, without offering compensating tangible benefits. The principle reasons for doubting the viability of the proposed scheme are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The level of graduate unemployment is difficult to predict over the next 5 years let alone into the 21st century.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Experience with both the Undergraduate Scheme and with direct entry graduates indicates that in order to get the best graduates the ADF will have to compete with the very attractive salary packages offered by the private sector. The financial constraints on the Defence budget do not permit such competition. The quality of graduate who will take up ADF employment therefore becomes somewhat problematic.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The proposed scheme does not readily offer the mechanism by which the ADF can regulate the number of graduates in the required disciplines, nor easily ensure that particular specialisations are recruited in the desired proportions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The sole reliance on a scheme that seeks to recruit undergraduates whilst at university leaves Defence recruitment at the mercy of not only societal attitudes to military service but also the complex interaction of political factors operating in university campuses around the country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Sponsorship Scheme will also undermine the existing Undergraduate Scheme, effectively reducing the management flexibility that Defence presently has in regulating the various entry modes to the officer corps. In summary, Defence doubts that the proposed Sponsorship Scheme would attract sufficient number of graduates, of the right quality, in the right proportions and at the right time. Therefore Defence cannot support the proposal as it stands. What Defence proposes is to examine the viability of implementing an extended university-based recruitment scheme in parallel with refinements to the conduct of undergraduate and postgraduate education at the Academy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Pursuant to the resolution of the Senate of 13 February 1991, I present the bilateral treaty and subsidiary agreement between the government of Australia and the government of Japan concerning tuna long&hyphen;line fishing, together with national interest analysis and statement of explanation as to the need for the implementation of the treaty. These documents were presented to Senator Calvert as Temporary Chairman of Committees on 7 June 1996 and, in accordance with the terms of the resolution, the publication of the documents was authorised.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT></PROCTEXT>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I would like to pay tribute to my colleague Senator Parer for obtaining <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the position of Minister for Resources and in doing so bringing to a head the long running dispute between the Australian and Japanese governments over southern bluefin tuna. It was having a particular effect on my state of Tasmania and the port of Hobart because, as part of the dispute between the Japanese and Australian governments, there was a boycotting of ports which meant that provedores involved in supplying provisions to the Japanese tuna boats that come into Hobart lost a fair amount of money. The provision of services to the Japanese fishing boats is worth quite a few million dollars to the port of Hobart.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The dispute was over the setting of the global catch quota. The Japanese wanted to increase that by 6,000 tonnes on an experimental basis to prove that the actual adult stock was improving in size. The Australian government does not believe that there is enough evidence yet to show that depleted adult stocks of southern bluefin tuna are recovering to sufficient levels to increase fishing. So we had this stand off between Australia and Japan in signing this annual treaty. But I am pleased to say that because of the work of members of the department and the leadership of my colleague Senator Parer we are now able to bring this treaty to fruition and cut a lot of red tape.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I, as temporary chairman, had the pleasure of signing on behalf of the Senate the agreements that were tabled here today. Some 55 boats are eligible to be fishing in the very rich area of the east coast of Tasmania. No more than 55 fishing licences are allowed to be used at any one time in that area. I do not need to remind the Senate of the value of the catch of tuna when it is presented to the Tokyo fish market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For many years now I have been amazed why there has not been any attempt to establish a similar type of industry to the Japanese longlining. It would seem to be a lucrative industry that perhaps some Australian fishermen could adapt to. I am pleased to say that there are now five fishermen, which could grow to even more, in Hobart who are longline tuna fishing in a similar fashion to the Japanese which means that we have a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1638"> Tasmanian or Australian based industry exporting chilled tuna into the Tokyo fish market thanks to the very good freight set up that has been established because of the salmon industry in Tasmania. That will allow tuna that is caught one day to arrive at the Tokyo fish market within 48 hours. So one can understand this new enterprise, which is in its very early days in Hobart, will hopefully contribute to the port of Hobart and also to the income of people of Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was very pleased to be part of this very important process. The Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna establishes a commission for the conservation of the tuna and to manage the species on a global basis. The treaty is a bilateral agreement. There are very strict guidelines and many government agencies are involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, the Australian government goes to great lengths to protect the fishing zones that are used by the Japanese and it goes to great lengths to ensure that Japanese fishermen comply with the conservation and regulatory requirements. That includes compulsory use of satellite vessel monitoring systems, daily catch and position reporting, fisheries observer coverage and seabird bycatch mitigation measures&mdash;tori poles, which keep our albatross away from the lines when the bait is being laid. Australian fishermen have been using these devices but this year is the first time the Japanese have been forced to use them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a good result and, once again, I would like to commend all those officers who were involved in the very delicate negotiations and, in particular, the minister for bringing the matter to a head.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>This is an important report. It is an important part of the outcomes of the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on the implications of Australia's defence exports. It is important because there was a lot of uncertainty about the process, from everybody's point of view. It seems that part of the problem has been insufficient coordination between the various bodies involved. That seems to be brought out in the conclusions of the audit office. The leaflet provided with the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is scope to improve the focus of export facilitation by better linking facilitation to the establishment and maintenance of industry capabilities of priority to Australia's defence self-reliance.</PARA>
<PARA>One of the questions we were asking during the process is: what is the basis of this policy? Is it based on what is good for Australia's defence? Is it based on what seems to be good for somebody to make dollars out of Australia's defence? What is it based on? Every time we ask the question, the goal posts seem to move. We hear, `Oh no, Senator. We are not just talking about dollars,' or, `Oh no, Senator. We are not just talking about Australia's defence.' But exactly what it was based on did not seem clear. If what it was based on was clear, then we would have some means of judging whether or not it was achieving its goals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think there is a lot to be said about this report. It is not just about dollars. I think what it is about needs to be clarified. It has recommended a review of defence export control legislation, including penalties amongst other things, and a liaison and coordination between agencies involved in the administration of export controls. I would say, `Hear, hear.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There certainly seems to be a need for the Department of Defence to not answer on everybody else's behalf, just as it did when <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1639"> the report was tabled in the Senate and just as it did to the dissenting report. It answered on behalf of Customs and it answered on behalf of Foreign Affairs. In fact, that has been the problem. Defence has been a kind of controlling mechanism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other issues involved&mdash;such things as human rights abuses by anybody with whom Australian companies might be negotiating an export grant&mdash;are considered important by many  people, but Defence was in fact making many of the decisions. They would choose whether or not an application was referred to the joint committee to decide such things. I would like to spend some time looking carefully at the report.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the report of the Commonwealth of Australia Branch delegation to the 41st Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference, held at Colombo, Sri Lanka, in October 1995. The conference was preceded by a meeting of the executive committee and a small countries conference. The report is slightly out of date because the conference was held in October 1995. Things move slowly in the Senate, and I am now giving the report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth of Australia delegation comprised Senator Nick Minchin; Senator Christabel Chamarette; Jim Snow, a member before the recent election was held; and Kathy Sullivan, member for Moncrieff, who was the deputy leader. As a regional representative of the CPA for the Australian region, I led the delegation and attended the meeting of the executive committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The conference was attended by some 250 delegates from 100 Commonwealth countries. Representatives from all Australian states and territories attended the conference so that together we made a substantial Australian contribution. I took the initiative to hold several informal meetings of all the Australians to provide feedback on executive committee matters and to discuss a consistent approach to various aspects and issues. This proved to be very worth while.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The theme of the conference was `Democracy and development: adversaries or allies?' In line with the practice developed since 1992, the emphasis was on the panel session, where more informal discussions took place. Jim Snow was invited to be a panel member at one of the sessions and other delegates were able to make contributions both at the panel session and at the conference plenary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth Secretary General, Chief Emeka Anyaoku, addressed the conference on the challenges and the opportunities facing the Commonwealth at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, which was due to take place in Auckland shortly after the conference. He focused in particular <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1640"> on ways in which the Commonwealth can achieve practical results in fulfilling the principles in the Harare Commonwealth declaration, especially in upholding democratic values within their own countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The general assembly of the CPA met at the beginning of the conference and agreed to the formation of branches in seven South African provinces. Representatives of those branches attended the conference and were welcomed by the delegates. At a later stage, I was lucky enough to attend the executive meeting in Cape Town, which was very well run and which showed that the country of South Africa was moving well and truly towards the democratic constitution that was being discussed at that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The conference does not have the power to pass resolutions or to agree to communiques expressing a particular position. However, at this conference the Hon. Ngereteina Puna, of the Cook Islands, and I were instrumental in the presentation of a petition expressing concern about the testing of nuclear weapons by France and China. While the part of the petition dealing with France is now out of date, the part dealing with China is still very much in vogue. The petition endorsed a declaration made earlier in the year by the Australian&hyphen;Pacific Regional Conference of the CPA and called on France to sign and ratify the protocols of the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty. Whilst the report says that the petition was signed by more than 100 delegates at the conference, I believe the number was closer to 200. The Commonwealth Secretary&hyphen;General agreed to convey the petition to Auckland for the attention of the Commonwealth heads of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth Women Parliamentarians Group conducted its seventh meeting in conjunction with the conference. For the first time, no other conference events were scheduled at the time of the meeting. This meant that I and other members of the CPA executive could attend and lend support to the group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The conference proceeded without a hitch, despite the uncertainties presented by the continuing conflict in Sri Lanka. The Sri <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Lanka branch and its secretariat are to be congratulated on their achievements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank the Australian high commissioner in Sri Lanka for his assistance during the conference. He and his staff provided briefings and news from Australia and helped arrange a reception hosted by Australia and New Zealand. The Sri Lankan high commission here in Australia also provided invaluable assistance and hospitality to the delegation prior to and after the visit of the delegation. I commend the report to the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to Sri Lanka between 3 and 6 October 1995. This delegation's visit to Sri Lanka was quite a short one&mdash;only four days&mdash;before attending the Commonwealth parliamentary conference held in Colombo, which Senator Jones just referred to. It was a successful visit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The delegation members for this visit were Mr Jim Snow, the former member for Eden Monaro, as leader; Mrs Kathy Sullivan, as deputy leader; Senator Chamarette; and me. Despite what you read in the papers, Australia is a more dangerous place for politicians than is Sri Lanka, as is evident from the fact that we survived whatever risks there were in Sri Lanka but half the delegation subsequently lost their places in the Australian parliament at the federal election. I pass on my regrets to Senator Chamarette and Mr Snow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The visit to Sri Lanka took place from 3 to 6 October last year and was the first visit there since 1986. At the time of the visit there had been considerable change in Sri Lanka and there was hope for a resolution to the long&hyphen;running conflict between the government of Sri Lanka and militant Tamil groups, most prominently the LTTE. Even though we had only four days in Sri Lanka, we were able to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1641"> meet with a wide range of people and talk about prospects for an end to the war and about trade and investment matters in Sri Lanka. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We met with a considerable number of ministers of the government, including the famous Prime Minister, Mrs Bandaranaike, who became the first woman Prime Minister in the world in 1960. It was an honour to meet her. In all the meetings we had with ministers and opposition party leaders, there was clearly a genuine commitment within the Sri Lankan parliament to achieving peace. However, it must be noted that the refusal of the LTTE to participate in negotiation on the reform proposals put forward by the Sri Lankan government put the prospects for peace in doubt. The LTTE's persistence in terrorist activity, rather than coming to the negotiation table, has led to a loss of credibility for that organisation in the international community and obviously has placed great hardship on the people of Sri Lanka.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia and Sri Lanka have enjoyed a very long and warm bilateral relationship based on strong Commonwealth links, wartime links and a flow of Sri Lankan migrants to Australia. We believe our visit consolidated that relationship. Trade and investment have been an important part of the relationship. We saw a number of opportunities for Australian investment in Sri Lanka and were able to discuss several existing projects. Despite the brief duration of the visit, we were able to see and talk to a number of people and see for ourselves the need for infrastructure development to support the growth in trade. I note in passing an advertisement in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> for its Sri Lanka country survey that will appear in November 1996. Its reflections on Sri Lanka were pertinent to this report. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the country should be seen as one which has managed to establish fiscal discipline in the national economy. With GDP growth expected to top 6.0 per cent in 1996, Sri Lanka has created an environment for foreign investment that is among the most attractive in South Asia. It also has one of the highest literacy and English&hyphen;language competency rates in the region, and has instituted a birth control program aimed to help the nation break out of its poverty trap. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">President Chandrika Kumaratunga has continued the privatisation program which marked her first year in office. This provides Sri Lanka with prospects for 1996 much better than even recent years. The government has also promised no new taxes.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that reflects the confidence which people increasingly have in Sri Lanka's future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In closing I would like record the delegation's thanks to everyone that we met with in Sri Lanka. At all meetings and inspections the delegation heard the frank views of the people we met and received very generous and warm hospitality. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank, in particular, the then Australian High Commissioner, Mr Bill Tweddell, and his wife for their hospitality, support and cooperation. I should congratulate Australia's foreign minister, Mr Alexander Downer, on appointing Mr Tweddell as his chief of staff. They will make a great team for this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On behalf of the delegation, I would also like to thank the staff of the High Commission, particularly Mr Dominic Trindade, who organised the itinerary and accompanied the delegation throughout Sri Lanka. The assistance and support provided by the High Commissioner and his staff were of the first order. The Sri Lankan High Commissioner in Canberra also provided tremendous assistance to the delegation and to the delegation to the parliamentary meeting. Their generous hospitality was very much appreciated. I commend the report to the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I also wish to address the report to which Senator Minchin and Senator Jones referred. It was a very memorable visit to Sri Lanka for me, and I support the comments that have been made. The hospitality and entertainment were truly wonderful. I would like to convey a special thanks to the Sri Lankan High Commissioner, His Excellency Mr Elmo De J. Seneviratne, for his preparatory and follow&hyphen;up evenings which assisted both the planning and experiences of the delegation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thanks too to the Australian High Commission which, as Senator Minchin already <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1642"> mentioned, were exemplary in the service and care provided not only to us as visitors but also, as was demonstrated, to the many different sectors within the Sri Lankan community. The High Commissioner, Mr Bill Tweddell, Dominic Trindade, Mr Titon Mitra and Mr Dunstan Fernando were extremely helpful in coordinating our visits into the exceedingly beautiful countryside, which which were very informative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very difficult to select highlights, but I just want to briefly mention some highlights of the visit for me. One was the meeting with three Australian women who were doing volunteer work with NGOs. Mary Norwood, Sheila Francis and Sue Allen are engaged in very productive and helpful work in a very strife torn area of Sri Lanka. The visit to the prison, which I was privileged to make, was a very enlightening experience, and I am very grateful to Mr C.T. Jansz, the chairman of the human rights committee, and also to the commissioner, Mr Dharmadasa, for graciously allowing that visit to occur. It did show the strife torn nature of the country. The proportion of people who are in prison without sentence was vastly greater than those who are under sentence. It was very interesting for me to meet with two Tamil Tigers&mdash;two young girls of 15 and 17&mdash;who were under detention there without sentence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An aspect of my visit which was very important was a visit to a place called CENWOR&mdash;Centre for Women's Research&mdash;where some very skilled work is going on in community development for women and publications. Another aspect was a visit with Mr Ponnampalan, the government agent in Jaffna, who shed some light on the conditions in the Jaffna Peninsula.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We must not forget the plight of this beautiful country. The civil war still ravages it and there is much human tragedy. There is polarisation within the citizenry, militarisation of the government and terrorism by the LTTE. This stems from deep historical conflicts which, to our eyes, seem far from resolution. The delegation was able to express concern regarding human rights violations, and urged the continuation of peaceful dialogue.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both parties involved in the Sri Lankan conflict have expressed an interest in negotiating for peace but do not seem to be willing to move from their positions.</PARA>
<PARA>There is a need for the world community to respond. They go on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the clear lack of political will for those peace negotiations within Sri Lanka, there is a clear need for pressure from outside the country to be applied to both the Government and the LTTE. Unfortunately, there appears to be little international interest or willingness to become involved.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RC6">Senator WHEELWRIGHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the 95th Inter&hyphen;Parliamentary Conference which was held in Istanbul between 15 and 20 April 1996. I might also point out to the Senate that, in order to pass on my recollections while they were fresh in my mind, I spoke on this matter in the adjournment debate on 1 May. As a consequence, I will <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1643"> spare you all from going over the same ground again. I managed to thank most of those involved during that speech.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did, however, neglect to thank the hosts in Turkey. The Turkish government were extraordinarily generous in their treatment of the delegates to the conference. I came back with the same sort of feeling that many senators would have had: you hope that we could do at least as well in our country. The hospitality that was extended to us overseas really did us proud. It was certainly a great revelation to me just how well the Turkish people run their country and how extraordinarily hospitable they are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The one thing I wanted to mention today, though, is the question of Cyprus. The IPU has a unique role in regard to Cyprus. I became involved mainly because of the work of a member in the other place, the member for Watson, the Hon. Leo McLeay. Mr McLeay has worked very hard and very long on the Cyprus committee of the IPU, and his contribution was such that the Australian delegation was asked if we could provide someone to carry on his work on that committee. We received a high degree of support and respect for the work which he had been able to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was very happy to leap into the breach because we have a very strong Greek Cypriot community in Sydney, one which I have been associated with for more years than I care to remember. I was more than happy to try to deal with the very difficult issues which are based in Cyprus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Cyprus is a very unhappy and a very unlucky country. Unfortunately, the IPU is the only international organisation which deals with both sides of the fence in Cyprus. The problem is very difficult for the United Nations, quite apart from the fact that it is embarrassing to have in the middle of Europe and the middle of the Mediterranean a country which is effectively partitioned. It is difficult also in that they can only recognise what they believe is the rightful government of Cyprus. But from the Turkish point of view, their argument is that, pursuant to the original agreement which made them co&hyphen;protectors of Cyprus, they certainly had <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> nothing to do with Cyprus or its partitioning and they acted only in defence of the Turkish community there, which was one of their rights under the original agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what you have in Cyprus is a very unfortunate stalemate. For the people there living conditions really are intolerable. The whole thing has dragged on because no-one has been able to find a way out of this particular wood. As a consequence, their lives are made miserable because they cannot do things like attend a funeral on the other side of the border. There are all sorts of problems in terms of power, telephones and so on. All of this has been running on for some 30 years or more. It is a very sad and unhappy place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The IPU does a great job in being able to talk to representatives from both sides in an informal way and try to work to some sort of lessening of the tensions, if not some ultimate resolution of the problems, they find on the island. One of the things that the IPU has been able to do is try to encourage cross&hyphen;border links&mdash;sporting links and other cultural links&mdash;between the two sides as a means of bringing down the tensions which so blight the life of the people on that particular island.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The IPU is also in an important position because, given the fact that it can talk to representatives from both sides, there was an extensive debate on the whole Cyprus question in the IPU on the final day. Again, that is not something that is easily done in other international forums such as the UN. I feel that the IPU is doing a good job there. I know it is difficult to maintain interest and it is very difficult to find willing members from other countries who want to go to a problem which has been around for so long and which does not necessarily hold out any great hope of resolution. Nevertheless, I trust that anybody from Australia will leap into the breach in future delegations and try to do their bit to find some way out of the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many other things that I could talk about in terms of the report but we have several other members of the delegation in the other place, including the leader and deputy leader, and I am sure that they will all avail the parliament of their experiences and give <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1644"> a full account.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also indicate that we do not support it now because the government has failed to demonstrate any urgency in relation to this <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1645"> bill. The matters under consideration do lead to a date of 21 September being used for the ending of the migration review procedures. However, it is quite appropriate that we should introduce the bill now and, as it is not a complicated bill, there is no reason why it should not be able to be debated in the following session. The proposals in it are simply to extend the time period for another 12 months in order to undertake a review. Because of that, we do not support it going through as urgent. We understand that there is majority support for it to proceed, so we are not proposing to call a division. But we want to point out that the whole underlying principle of the procedural motion, which was put into the standing orders by Senator Hill in his role as Leader of the Opposition last year, is to have an orderly process of legislation which allows for community consultation and to guard against the sausage machine approach to legislation which allows even a simple piece of legislation to come in and go out of this place in the space of a week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might also point out that while it is the first session of this new parliament and there are some exigencies that occur in relation to that, the amendment to the procedural motion to cover that was that any bills that were to be discussed in this last third of the session should have been introduced in the first four weeks of this session. So even by the phrasing of the government's own amendment, they really should have introduced this bill earlier in order to be proceeding to exempt it and debate it now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While we do not have any concerns about the content of the bill, it is on the principle that it is not urgent and it could be considered when the parliament resumes in the next session that we are opposing the motion. That would allow people in the community to know exactly what this Senate chamber is holding under debate and consideration. It is a matter of principle. We do not want to see Senator Hill's procedural order undermined. As the chamber well knows, I have a particular investment in that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Delay of the Customs Amendment Bill 1996 will also create uncertainty in the business community where the expectations are that the changes will be in place on 1 July this year as announced.

<PARA>Our amendment No. 2 to the preamble to the Housing Assistance Bill says, `of an appropriate standard'. The phrase `housing of an appropriate standard' might lead people to believe that we have appropriate standards. In many places there are virtually no insulation standards, there are no guidelines to orienta <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1647"> tion, and there are no guidelines in terms of ventilation in tropical dwellings. We do have safety and engineering standards, but we have virtually no environmental standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of the houses in southern areas are very cold in winter. We have a lot of empty&hyphen;walled asbestos or single brick houses. We have houses with louvred windows where the weather may get to below freezing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A few years ago, I heard a lecture by an expert in energy efficient design from near Manchester in England. He spoke of how design requirements for houses in England were nearly 100 years behind those in Sweden and other Scandinavian countries. He was outlining the difference that made on energy bills. Considering what the government has been saying about greenhouse gas, this is really quite interesting: as an aside, he said that, though the houses in England were less well designed to retain heat than in Denmark or Sweden, the coldest, most miserable winter he has ever had was in Brisbane, in Queensland. He put it down to the total failure to incorporate any idea of heat retention in house designs. This is typical of Australian housing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the south we see houses that make it almost impossible to retain heat. In the north we see poorly insulated, poorly ventilated houses put up in tracts. They may be framed houses with some thin sheathing on the outside, hardiplank, weatherboard, or whatever. So-called better houses may be made of bricks that have been hauled from the south and made to standard southern&hyphen;suburban design. There is often little incorporation of traditional design, even in areas like Broome, where traditional designs incorporating better ventilation appropriate to the tropics have been developed in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not as if these factors have not been recognised. Almost all literature about what can be done about the greenhouse effect includes information urging people to insulate their houses. This mostly is suggested as something to be done by householders after they buy. But any survey of progressive policies notes that many nations or states elsewhere in the world include in building codes requirements for minimum insulation <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> standards. Most have varying standards for roofs, for walls, even for windows. In the United States and northern Europe, many areas have minimum standards for the insulating quality of window glass. They require high insulation double glazing because, after insulating ceilings and walls, the windows are the areas where most heat enters or escapes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If anyone does even a minimum perusal of environmentally sound design, they will find a plethora of other measures, often simple measures, for creating long-term benefits in terms of energy efficiency and the comfort of residents: making certain that eaves overhang for windows is appropriate to block the sun in summer and to let it in during the winter is a simple thing for during the design stage; and considering orientation of major windows to make certain that most of them do not face a problem with direction, like having it south in cold areas where such windows will never get sunlight. There is also the measure of using skylights, and so on. These are easy to do in the beginning; hard to fix or change afterwards. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These sorts of considerations have been part of many government strategies and policies for greenhouse responses, for policies relating to ecologically sustainable development and elsewhere. The idea is not new to government. There have been programs to promote such building codes. There is the Amcord program within the department of housing. The better cities program recognises the need for such measures, but only slightly. In part, there is a recognition of the fact that it is much easier and much cheaper to build houses in an environmentally sound way than it is to try to retrofit. It is recognised that most people do not get to design their own houses. Even when buying new houses, it is usually a developer that determines the choices and options a buyer has.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important then to ensure that the new houses are built well from an environmental viewpoint. It is even more important where housing is not built with house purchase in mind, where the intention is for rental. Renters generally have less legal option to retrofit, even if they have the money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It becomes an equity issue. Where poor people rent and have trouble affording heat <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1648"> and cooling, it can become a health problem. It is an environmental issue and an issue of family costs. It is also an issue of social costs, since failure of demand management on energy means that the state must build new power plants, put in newer and bigger powerlines and substations, increase gas purchase, build new gas lines and install new pumping stations. But I guess that the government would consider that as growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is believed that the introduction of energy efficiency in buildings here, including commercial and industrial buildings, could reduce electricity and gas demand by over 15 per cent. It is something we could do about the greenhouse effect that would not cost business a thing. It would provide jobs and reduce state outlays and household and business overheads. We are not talking about freezing in the dark, which is what the present policy leads to. We are talking about being comfortable at low cost by designing buildings so we do not have to throw away energy, heat, coolness or money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I repeat: effectively, there are almost no environmental or energy efficiency standards in Australian housing. There should be but it becomes ludicrous and negligent when government is actually in the position of building housing itself and does not even take action in its own projects. This has been the case with Commonwealth&hyphen;state housing, and it is not good enough to say that it is the state's fault.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth has a responsibility for the greenhouse response effort. The Commonwealth spends millions on promoting sound design. The Commonwealth provides the money for state housing and has a basic duty to ensure taxpayers' money is spent well. It has a duty to ensure that human rights and social welfare are considered. It has a duty to consider that the money it is spending on housing is not spent so badly that the Commonwealth must then pick up a large burden of costs through energy subsidies to poor people trying to get warm. It has a duty to ensure that its housing expenditure is not increasing its health expenditure. This may not be what economists who see a fragmented department by department bottom line mean <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> by efficiency but it is what the Greens mean by both economic and social efficiency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not efficient to have no standards when that increases economic and quality of life costs in other areas. This was finally recognised last year, at least in respect of government funded housing, when the government talked about new criteria for the CSHA, which would include environmental standards. We welcomed that move. We do not believe it is appropriate for the new government to cut that out. We know the new government is not necessarily friendly to any environmental measure but cutting out the environmental aspect of the Commonwealth&hyphen;state housing agreement really goes too far.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many people can still afford housing; an increasing number cannot do so easily. Environmentally appropriate housing is almost non-existent. It is simply not correct to say that most people can obtain appropriate, affordable housing. It, therefore, should not be said. This is the background to these two amendments.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Many people have difficulty obtaining housing that is environmentally appropriate. Adequate insulation and design to minimise water and energy consumption without compromising amenity is not generally required or provided. Urban planning often does not take the need to reduce mechanised transport or to optimise passive solar exposure into consideration.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> People who are economically or socially disadvantaged may be less likely to obtain environmentally appropriate housing. This can have adverse economic effects. They may also have difficulty obtaining housing in areas that maximise their income through proximity to required services, adequate public transport, employment, shopping and areas for social interaction and support.</PARA>
<PARA>The first paragraph of our third amendment&mdash;and once again we are still on page 2 of the preamble&mdash;makes explicit the concerns the Commonwealth ought to have in regard to environmental design. I have gone into a number of issues in speaking to my previous amendments so I will not repeat myself fully, which you will be pleased to hear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a huge range of design options that go well beyond insulation. There are things like underfloor heat sinks, integrated glasshouse areas, traum walls and a broad range of passive solar design measures that could be integrated into design, especially where it is designed for medium density state rental housing. The designs have been around for decades and are of proven worth. Many states actually have advisory services to promote such options. They just do not take their own advice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also a range of active solar elements that could be included, the biggest being solar water heating. This should be standard in publicly owned housing wherever practical, which is almost everywhere in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our amendment also includes water conservation. There are a number of design features that promote water conservation. There are <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> low consumption shower heads and so on at one end and the more radical things such as designing grey water systems so they are easier to use for garden watering at the other. Water conservation is increasingly an issue in most urban areas. It is another area where there are Commonwealth and state policies to ensure water is conserved. We do live on a dry continent and there is no reason water waste should be built into public housing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last sentence of our first paragraph expands the issue of environmental design in housing to more explicitly include urban design, and I will speak briefly to this. The better cities program was specifically devised to address some of these concerns, and the concerns about urban design have appeared in things like greenhouse strategies and the ecologically sustainable development policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The basic idea is that when we design our cities, even more than designing our houses, we make decisions that will determine the day-to-day options we have available. These policies determine our range of choice. A technologist once said about choice that social choice is often made once, and made effectively for everyone. For example, once people choose cars as the major form of transport, the choice to use a horse for daily transport effectively disappears. It becomes impractical for most people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the structure of our cities, we persistently choose to live in a way highly dependent on the private motor vehicle. In part, this is based on past choice. We have suburbs and sprawling cities often with lower density than almost anywhere but Los Angeles. It is hard to do without cars so we tend to build for cars, but building for cars just makes us that more dependent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The initial choices were not accidents. Many of you, particularly those with children, may have seen a movie a few years ago called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Who Framed Roger Rabbit?</EMPHASIS>. It was a cartoon set in Los Angeles in the 1940s. It was about a plot to buy up all the trams in that city, rip up the lines and build freeways. Not many people realised that this was a true story.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1650"> In the 1930s, in Los Angeles and 44 other US cities, a consortium, composed of Stan dard Oil, General Motors, and Firestone tyres, at a time when Los Angeles had one of the best public transport systems in the world bought all the trams and ripped up the lines. Since then a lot of petrol cars and tyres have been sold and Los Angeles has become the global symbol of urban sprawl and smoggy mess. Recently, Los Angeles has embarked on a program to bring back the trams in the form of electric light rail. It is expected to cost billions but the city sees it as one of the only ways of starting to deal with its huge environmental problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently there has been a lot of attention on the environmental impact of car use in Sydney. In Perth, a few years ago, we had the first photochemical smog events, events which have now become regular. We may not have the tendency to inversion that plagues Los Angeles but we do have environmental problems in our cities as a consequence of car use.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Car dependency creates environmental problems. Cars consume a large amount of resources in their creation. New so&hyphen;called efficient cars usually gain efficiency by reduced use of materials, making them lighter and thinner and needing less energy to move them. This also makes them more fragile and less long&hyphen;lasting. This in turn increases throughput.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today's cars are clapped&hyphen;out bombs after 10 or 15 years, while older cars are still in everyday use. New cars may need less material to make but we have to replace them more often. Over time, the material and energy used in fabrication is not less because the time between creation and disposal decreases. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Car use entails a lot of emissions. Greenhouse gases are an obvious factor, as is lead in older cars. But there are many other emissions and pollutants. Fibres from brake linings, particulates, benzene and aromatic hydrocarbons, polycyclic hydrocarbons, nitrous and sulfur oxides and ozone are all produced from engine combustion. When this mixture rises into the light of a busy traffic day, it forms a chemical soup which is triggered by light into creating new compounds photochemically.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find the point of order very disturbing because it indicates that there is absolutely no understanding of the connection between the design and placement of public housing and the way our cities work. If that be the case, things are far worse than I had suspected. I will continue with the line I was taking so that senators can work out what I am getting at.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Petrol is expensive and we are running out of it. We will soon be dependent on imports. Australia is not the only nation which will face problems with oil field depletion. Production in major oil fields around the globe has peaked. Oil prices are still very low but they cannot remain that way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We live in a fool's paradise if we plan our cities as though we had abundant oil. What does this have to do with the CSHA? The new bill removes the old measure in paragraph (h) regarding the better cities program and some obligation to consider urban design when spending $1 billion a year on public housing. As I said earlier, if this new government does not understand the connection between that proposal and what I am saying, things are much worse than I thought.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second paragraph of our amendment indicates why what I am saying is important. For poorer people, the people who live in or by state housing, it will be crucially important to their domestic economy to have environmental standards in their housing that will allow them to reduce heating and power bills. It is also important to have housing where car dependency is not built in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tendency with public housing has been to sell off older housing in inner city areas that have become more up&hyphen;market and to build new housing on the urban fringes. The principle has been that the land is valuable and more could be done for people by selling <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1651"> existing housing than by retaining it. Putting aside the question of whether the money from such asset sales goes back into public housing at all, the effect is to make housing in inner city areas unavailable to poorer people. It moves the poor out into spatial fringes or to ghetto areas where land is cheap.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Western Australia, much of the public housing in the Fremantle area has been sold and knocked down for development, with the poor being directed to Armadale or areas behind Kwinana. When things like that happen it means that people cannot walk easily to facilities, and that impacts adversely on senior citizens and mothers with children. We must also remember that public housing clients are often poor and may not be able to afford cars. In the case of older or disabled people, they may not be able to use them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Around Fremantle, buses are plentiful and frequent. It is a transport hub. But in some of the back areas of Armadale, away from the rail line, buses are extremely infrequent. For someone to get from Armadale to Murdoch University, a 15&hyphen; to 20&hyphen;minute car ride, a person would have to get a bus to the rail line, go into Perth&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over the years, there have been many speeches in this chamber on the subject of the length of term of parliaments. In the lead&hyphen;up to the referendums put to the Australian people on 3 September 1988 the momentum actually increased. However, electors rejected a change in the constitution at that time. There were significant disadvantages in putting an option of a four&hyphen;year term to the people in that year. After all, it was our bicentennial year, when people were wanting to celebrate the advantages of our constitution and the great benefits that have come to our country because of the foresight of those people who drew it up. The mood was just not right for focussing on change at that time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A more significant reason for its failure was the suspicion with which Australians looked upon this proposed change. And rightly so. The establishment of the Constitutional Commission was always suspect. Proposals for changing our constitution, the fundamental framework for governing, should be discussed by the people's representatives, not a commission whose members are selected by the government, whose terms of reference are imposed by the government and whose findings are pre-empted by the government. Australians are indeed intelligent people. They suspected that there was political advantage for the then Labor Party, and they were not wrong. So all the referendums at that time were lost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The referendum on four-year terms was linked to changes in the Senate. It removed the fixed term of senators and established a system of permanent double dissolutions. As the Hon. Peter Reith pointed out at the time in the other House, it removed the one fixed element in the system. At the time, the Hon. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1653"> Gareth Evans was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> to have said, `The way to abolish the Senate, or at least muzzle it, is to white ant it from within.' Australians were rightly suspicious of the intent of the referendum proposals and, therefore, rejected them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While history does not favour the success of referendums&mdash;in that out of 38 amendments to the constitution put to referendum only eight have succeeded&mdash;when they have actually represented a genuine and honest attempt to improve the constitution for the benefit of all Australians, our people have actually been quite happy to support referendum change. Recognition of Aborigines as Australian citizens, for example, has never been an issue since that referendum was passed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now, eight years after the last referendums were put to the electorate, there is an increasing urgency to create a more stable economic environment. As our economic situation becomes increasingly complex, both nationally and also internationally, the certainty of a four-year term, particularly a fixed four-year term, would reduce the number of variables from which business would have to work. It would not only be our business leaders who would welcome a four-year fixed term; foreign companies, too, looking for investment opportunities would be keen to add the benefit of a four-year term of parliament to the other advantages that Australia has to offer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Overseas investors find Australia attractive for many reasons, not least is the relative political stability. We are only one of a few countries which have never been devastated by a civil war or an invasion by a foreign power in the last 200 years. The benefits which our peaceful history has brought to overseas investments are well known. However, once these potential investors become aware that a new government has only three years to implement its policies, they find that they may need to reconsider their options. If that happens to come on a business scene halfway through a government term or later, they are confronted with the possibility of an election and change in policy at any time. Very few major decisions can be made by <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> governments or businesses after the first 18 to 24 months following a federal election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is one of the few factors encouraging the Japanese, for example, to invest in Australian developments? Confidence&mdash;confidence that the rules on which investments are based will remain constant. This confidence can be further engendered by extending the term of parliament to four years. It will also mean that, once new measures are taken, business can be confident that the ground rules will stay the same for at least four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been more federal elections since 1949 in Australia than there have been in the US, which has fixed biennial terms. Four-year terms would bring the federal government into line with all state governments apart from Queensland. The vast majority of democratic countries have terms of at least four years. In fact, Britain and Canada and a number of others actually have terms of five years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cost of these elections is of grave concern to many people, who believe that there have been far too many over the years. The estimated cost of the federal election in March 1996 was $54 million. This figure does not include the estimated $33.4 million element of public funding. That is a total of $87.4 million of taxpayers' money. Yes, you have heard correctly. It was $87.4 million. Of course, that does not include all the other money that is privately spent on election campaigns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This figure of $87.4 million compares with $39.8 million spent on the 1984 federal poll. The 1996 cost was more than double that of the 1984 federal poll, and that doubling between 1984 and 1996 can be largely explained by the introduction of public funding of election campaigns. But the message is clear. More elections mean more money&mdash;money that can be much more effectively used, I believe, elsewhere. The costs of polls have skyrocketed. Obvious savings would be gained with fewer elections; thus, it is quite an attractive proposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many considerations have to be taken into account by a government when calling an election. Fewer elections would reduce the problem of trying to steer clear of state <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1654"> elections. You have the example of this last election, where the Tasmanian election was held the week before the federal poll, making it extremely difficult for federal candidates to get across their message in just one week. Of course, there are a lot more state parliamentarians than there are federal parliamentarians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While it is known that a state election cannot be held on the same day as a federal election, since a federal election does take precedence, the Tasmanian government had to call its election not knowing what the federal government was going to do. In those circumstances, the inevitable scenario eventuated where the Tasmanian poll was just one week ahead of the federal poll. You can just imagine the competition for space for advertising in the three regional newspapers in Tasmania. Fewer elections would at least reduce the possibility of this sort of event occurring again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a slightly different scenario, the Victorian state election was called just one week after the federal election. The pressure this put on the electoral officers is something that would more likely be avoided if the federal House of Representatives had a four-year fixed term. States would have clear guidelines to go by in their choice of election date, and this would again provide greater certainty for business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer to a paper in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Council Bulletin</EMPHASIS> No. 30 of January 1987, which reports:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the frequency of elections is not simply a nuisance or irritation; it clearly has major implications for government decision-making, for budgetary policies and therefore for the economic climate in which businesses have to make major investment decisions.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say that one of the consequences of shorter terms is a curtailed budgetary cycle, and this in turn disrupts a government's economic strategy. The paper refers to the adverse effect elections have on retail sales. I am sure that my colleagues here are aware of the pressures from the retail sector on a government not to hold an election in the lead-up to Christmas because of the very likely impact on revenue, lost revenue, during the most profitable time of the year. These <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sorts of arguments, I believe, strongly support the case for four-year fixed terms for the federal government. I urge all senators to give the issue serious consideration.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)(a) My Department does not have figures on the number of farm families who are precluded from family payment by their assets. The cost of exempting farm families currently in receipt of family payment from the assets test has been estimated as approximately $440,000 per year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)(b) The total estimated cost of exempting family farms from the assets test on age pension would be of the order of one billion dollars a year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The complaints referred to in the honourable senator's question were transferred by the Commission to the Victorian Equal Opportunity Commission (`VEOC') under the co-operative arrangements in place with that body for the handling of complaints under the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. My answers are based on information sought from the VEOC by the Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)(a) I am advised that all relevant information regarding the complaints has not yet been obtained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) I am advised that the VEOC has analysed the applicability of the legislation to the complaints and the information that has been obtained to date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) I am advised that the VEOC has not yet interviewed all relevant witnesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) I am advised that the VEOC has identified some individual witnesses who may provide evidence. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) I am advised that the VEOC will follow its usual procedure in obtaining evidence. Witnesses give evidence to the best of their knowledge and ability and if there is any evidence or material which suggests that evidence is false or misleading, it is put to witnesses for a response to test their evidence. Such evidence together with the response is assessed to determine the quality of the evidence given by witnesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(f) I am advised that the VEOC has taken all reasonable steps to ensure that evidence is given freely and voluntarily. There has been a suggestion that some evidence may have been tainted and analysis by the VEOC of this issue has resulted in one complaint being withdrawn.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(g) This question has been answered in sub-paragraph (e) above.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(h) As noted in sub-paragraph (a) above, the VEOC has not yet obtained all relevant information. However, the VEOC confines its consideration of a complaint to information which is probative and relevant. Where necessary and possible, corroborative evidence has been sought in relation to particular matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i) I am advised that the VEOC has taken all reasonable steps to ensure that evidence obtained is reliable. Where evidence obtained during an inquiry into a complaint is flawed in any of the ways mentioned in the honourable senator's question, the Chief Conciliator of VEOC would give consideration to declining the complaint as lacking in substance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) I am advised that a written response was not provided to the letter of 26 July 1995. There have, however, been discussions with the complainant regarding the content of that letter. The VEOC believes that the matters raised in the letter have been adequately addressed with the complainant and do not require a written response.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) I am advised that the VEOC is not aware of any agreement between Monash University and itself, or of any breach of such agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) I am advised that these complaints have been extremely complex and vexed with an extraordinary amount of evidence, claim and counter-claim. The first file was opened on 30 June 1994 and it, together with numerous related complaints, was referred to the VEOC in December 1994. Of the complaints lodged, four have been withdrawn during the inquiry process and one has been declined. Two complainants have appointments to discuss further their complaints with withdrawals by those complainants possible. Investigation is proceeding into the one remaining complaint.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) I am examining various options for whistleblowing laws. In relation to the particular issues raised in the honourable senator's question, I will be considering whether any whistleblowing laws <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1660"> should extend beyond the public service, the most appropriate body to investigate whistleblowing cases and what interim measures may need to be taken if whistleblowing laws are to be introduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) As noted above, there have been considerable inquiries into these complaints and the results of those inquiries are set out as far as possible in paragraph (4) above. The complainants have not framed their complaints to the VEOC in terms of criminal misconduct and, as far as the VEOC is aware, none of the complainants has approached the police. In light of that, and of the status of the Commission and the VEOC as statutory bodies established for the purpose, amongst others, of independently and impartially investigating complaints of this nature, I am not prepared to initiate an inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) I am advised that the VEOC's complaints staff handle a mix of complaints under the various pieces of anti-discrimination legislation. It has a complaints staff of 11 permanent officers and, during the period in question, there have been 6 in temporary positions. The VEOC also employs 2 indigenous officers who assist with complaints from indigenous people, primarily complaints of race discrimination.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Administrative Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)(a) The total estimated value of the common use arrangement for the supply of motor spirits, oils and greases over the three year period 1.1.96 to 31.12.98 is $165 m. Shell is one of four petrol suppliers under this arrangement and it is difficult to estimate their market share.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) My Department does not have a separate contract with Shell. It accesses the government contract mentioned in 1(a).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)(a) My Department is not aware of any other Commonwealth departments having contracts for petrol with Shell. However, some Government Business Enterprises may well have separate contracts with Shell.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Purchasing Australia, a division of my Department, puts in place the common use arrangement for petrol mentioned in 1(a). Dasfleet and Comcar utilise this government contract. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4)(a) Public tenders were invited for the provision of motor spirit, oils and greases. Appointment to the panel of suppliers was made following evaluation of tenders against a range of criteria which included price, capacity and infrastructure to provide the products, distributor network, fuel card facilities, and delivery times for bulk supplies. Shellcards are not the only fuel cards available. There are three other petrol suppliers under the contract and each customer chooses the supplier which offers the best value for money with regard to its particular requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Australian ownership was not a factor in the establishment of this arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) The current common use arrangement is due for renewal on 1 January 1999.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) Common use arrangements for fuel have traditionally covered a three year period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) A standing offer may be terminated by the Government, but this is normally only done if the supplier fails to fulfil the agreed terms and conditions of the arrangement. A claim for damages may be filed and would be determined in the courts.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1 and 2) The AMLC commenced subscription charging for its market intelligence services from 6 May 1996. Registered producers, exporters and processors (levy payers) that subscribed to these services were offered discounted subscription rates ($54 per annum). Other Australian and foreign subscribers will pay higher subscriptions. The services are now provided on a paid subscription basis only.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) AMLC is operating on a budget that has been significantly reduced in the last three years. The subscription rates set by the AMLC are geared toward recovery of the cost of maintaining the AMLC Market Intelligence Unit. Not all registered levy payers would have regular use for these services, and continued provision of market intelligence information paid for by levy payers to non levy payers for a low fee, or no fee, would be considered unreasonable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The approach adopted by the AMLC, on the strong recommendation of the Meat Industry Council, the current peak industry representative authority, will reduce the burden on levy payers, test the value of this market intelligence information in the market, and is consistent with a less regulated environment. This will be of benefit to levy payers. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA></ANSWER></ANSWER.TO.QON>
