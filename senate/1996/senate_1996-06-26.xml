<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to the Air Navigation (Aircraft Engine Emission) Regulations, Statutory Rules 1995 No.277, considered by the Committee at its meeting of 19 October 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subregulation 6(2) provides that the Secretary or an authorised officer may grant a permit exempting aircraft from provisions of the legislation; subregulation 6(3) provides that the Secretary or the authorised officer may impose conditions on a permission; and subregulation 6(4) provides that a permission must specify a period of up to a month during which the aircraft is exempt.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subregulation 9(1) provides that a decision under subregulation 6(2) to refuse to give a permit, or to revoke a permit, is reviewable by the AAT. However, there does not appear to be any express provision under which decisions about conditions or times of exemption are reviewable. The Committee believes that, if subregulation 9(1) does not include decisions made under subregulations 6(3) and (4), the Regulations should be amended to provide for this right. The Committee would appreciate your cooperation.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Chairman</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to the letter of 19 October 1995 from Senator Colston, the previous Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances (the Committee) to the former Minister for Transport, the Hon L Brereton MP, concerning the Committee's request to amend the Air Navigation (Aircraft Engine Emissions) Regulations. I understand that the Department of Transport advised the Committee Secretary during the caretaker period of Government that this matter would be taken up with the incoming Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I concur with the Committee's view that the above Regulations omit to provide for an appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) for decisions under subregulations 6(3) and (4). As you have noted, the Regulations provide for a decision to refuse or revoke a permit to exempt an aircraft from the provisions of the legislation to be appellable to the AAT.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to achieve a consistent approach towards access to the AAT for all administrative decisions made under these Regulations, I have directed my Department to prepare an appropriate draft amendment to the Air Navigation (Aircraft Engine Emissions) Regulations.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Minister</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to the Air Navigation Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1995 No 342.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New r.309H(1) requires a regulated agent to give effect to the agent's international cargo security program. New rr.309H(3) and (4), however, provide for the Secretary to exempt an agent from r.309H(1). There does not appear to be provision for review of this discretion, which could affect <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2172"> business operations. In this context, r.309M provides for review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal of discretions provided by five other new regulations in the present set of Regulations. The Committee asks whether the omission of r.309H discretions was intended and, if so, of the reasons for such omission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Regulations give wide powers to authorised officers. However, the principal Regulations properly provide that before exercising these powers in relation to a person an authorised officer must produce a suitably endorsed photographic identity card. The Regulations also give powers to security officers. However, although security officers who are members of a uniformed security force or persons employed by an airport operator for the purpose of security must produce identification, there is no requirement for this to include a recent photograph. The Committee would appreciate your comments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New rr.311C(3)(d) and 311CAA(2)(d) provide that an authorised person has power "to discuss" operating procedures with specified crew and employees. It is unclear how far these powers extend. For instance, the provisions do not include the usual requirement that people must answer questions, with protection against self&hyphen;incrimination. What is the obligation, if any, of an employee or crew member to take part in any discussion? May an employee refuse to answer questions? The Committee notes that there is a penalty of $5,000 if the authorised person is not permitted to exercise the power and if there is no reasonable excuse. Would it be a reasonable excuse if an employee or crew number declined to discuss procedures with an authorised person? The Committee would appreciate your advice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New r.309F(3) provides that a regulated agent must comply with a direction of the Secretary, while r.309F(4) provides that an agent must not contravene subregulation (3) intentionally or recklessly. No pecuniary penalty is fixed, although under r.309J(1)(d) the Secretary may remove a regulated agent's name from the list of air cargo agents if the agent breaches r.309F(4). However, an intentional or reckless breach of a direction of the Secretary under r.309K attracts a penalty of $5,000 as well as possible removal from the list. The Committee would appreciate your advice on the reasons for the substantial pecuniary penalty in one case but not in the other.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Colston</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of 25 January 1995 to the former Minister for Transport concerning the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Air Navigation Regulations (Amendment)</EMPHASIS> , Statutory Rules 1995 No 342.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">RESPONSES TO QUESTIONS OF THE SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE, REGULATIONS AND ORDINANCES</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Appeals to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee asks whether the omission of regulation 309H, from the list of decisions of the Secretary that are appellable to the AAT under regulation 309M, was intended. The omission was intended.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Regulations apply the general policy, in the matter of administrative appeals, of providing an appeal in relation to all decisions that may potentially act against the interests of a person affected by the decision. For example, a decision by the Secretary to reject a proposal (including a one&hyphen;off proposal) of a regulated agent to modify the agent's cargo security measures under regulation 309G is appealable to the AAT.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Cargo security measures implemented by an agent are outlined within the agent's international cargo security program. The program is a document of the agent, in that the agent prepares the program and sends a copy to the Secretary. The agent is accountable for implementing the cargo security measures outlined within its program. Where the Secretary is satisfied that the program is adequate for the purposes of aviation security (as outlined under regulation 309D), the Secretary may list the agent as a Regulated Agent. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2173"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A decision of the Secretary to exempt an agent, under subregulation 309H(4), does not involve a potential to act against the interests of a person affected by the decision. Rather, a decision of the Secretary under subregulation 309H(4) has the effect of removing an obligation from the affected Regulated Agent, an obligation that the Regulated Agent freely entered into in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, an agent faced with a refusal of the Secretary to agree to an exemption against its program can seek an amendment to its program covering the exemption under Regulation 309G (which allows an AAT appeal).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Identification cards for security officers</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee notes that, under regulation 311CAAA, security officers may request an individual to identify himself or herself. The Committee further notes that security officers who are members of a uniformed security force and persons employed by the operator of a categorised airport for the purpose of airport security are required to produce their identification card, or another appropriate form of identification, when exercising this power. The Committee asks why there is no requirement for the identification to include a recent photograph of the security officer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a scheme covering identification cards for use within security restricted areas of Australia's airports&mdash;the Aviation Security Identification Card (or ASIC) scheme. Security officers are one of the classes of persons required to wear ASICs. A primary (and mandatory) feature of the ASIC is a photograph of the ASIC holder. ASICs have a fixed period of validity and must be renewed at least once every 5 years. As a result, the photograph of the ASIC holder, printed on the front of the ASIC, cannot be more than 5 years old.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the Committee's point in this matter is acknowledged and the drafting of an amendment will be requested for subregulation 311CAAA(3) to require security officers (described in paragraph 311CAAA(1)(b) or (c)), when exercising their powers (including in areas other than security restricted areas of airports), to produce an identification card that includes a recent photograph which is to be no more than 5 years old.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Powers of authorised officers to discuss procedures with industry</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee notes that, under paragraphs 311C(3)(d) and 311CAA(2)(d), authorised officers are empowered to discuss procedures with aircraft crew; or employees of an aircraft operator, an airport operator or a Regulated Agent. The Committee believes that it is unclear how far these powers extend.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The intention of these provisions is merely to ensure that the normal conduct of authorised officers (ie, specified officers of the Department of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Transport and Regional Development), when carrying out aviation security audits of industry, is within power and may not be impeded by the employer. Aviation security audits of industry bodies, by officers of the Department, normally involve the officers observing and inspecting the security procedures performed by airlines, airport operators and regulated agents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Regulations provide that authorised officers may stay within relevant premises during the audit process and may observe and inspect procedures performed in those premises. The legal effect of this power (and of the offences under subregulations 311C(6) and 311CAA(3) is that airlines, airport operators or regulated agents may not eject authorised officers from the premises for trespass during the conduct of an authorised aviation security audit. In relation to off&hyphen;airport premises, these audit powers only exist in relation to audits conducted during a reasonable time (eg, during normal business hours) and only after the authorised officer has given notice of the audit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These powers also include the power to discuss procedures with industry staff. That is, the Regulations provide that, in the event that authorised officers discuss procedures with industry staff, the authorised officers are not acting beyond their powers. The provision is designed to prevent an aircraft operator, airline operator or regulated agent from impeding a discussion between a Departmental officer and an employee during the course of an audit. There is no compulsion in the Regulation on employees to answer questions. The reason for this is that much of the activity being assessed will be apparent to Departmental staff from personal observation or sighting documentation, the purpose of discussion would be to clarify what has been already been observed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In answer to the Committee's specific questions, an employee may refuse to answer a question put by an authorised officer. The obligation in the Regulation is on the aircraft operator, airline operator or regulated agent not to prevent a discussion occurring.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Penalties under the cargo offences</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee notes that, under regulation 309K, a Regulated Agent failing to comply with a Secretary's direction (relating to measures and resources to be used by the agent in responding to a threat) is guilty of an offence. The penalty is 50 penalty units. The Committee also notes that an agent must also comply, under Regulation 309F, with a direction of the Secretary to amend its cargo security program. However, an agent failing to comply with a direction under regulation 309F is not guilty of an offence. The agent is merely subject to an administrative action&mdash;the agent's removal from the Regulated Agents list. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2174"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee requests advice on the reasons for the substantial pecuniary penalty in one case but not in the other.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Regulations introduce new aviation security standards for the handling and carriage of Australian outbound international air cargo. Cargo security controls are required to be applied by either the airline carrying the cargo or an air cargo agent who has elected to perform the controls on the cargo it handles and who has been registered with the Secretary. This allows security controls applied by agents to be recognised by the airline carrying the cargo.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Regulations do not specify the detailed security standards to be implemented for the handling of cargo. These are detailed within the security programs of international airlines and those agents who elect to become Regulated Agents. A Regulated Agent could, at any time, elect to opt out of the scheme, in which case the cargo security controls would be applied by another person eg, the airline carrying the cargo. An agent who elects to opt out would not be guilty of an offence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regulation 309J outlines the circumstances in which the Secretary may de&hyphen;list an agent. The effect of de&hyphen;listing an agent is that the security controls applied by the agent are no longer able to be recognised by airlines carrying international cargo.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regulation 309F allows the Secretary to give notice to a regulated agent to amend its program, in the event that the Secretary is satisfied that the program is not adequate. For example, the nature of cargo normally handled by a regulated agent could change over time, requiring an equivalent change in the security measures implemented by that agent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The intention is to view an agent, who fails to comply with a direction to amend a program, in the same way as an agent who elects to opt out of the cargo scheme. In both cases, the agent has decided no longer to apply security controls over the cargo it handles. Also in both cases, the decision of the agent is transparent to the Secretary and alternative measures may be made in relation to the cargo. The power to issue directions to agents under Regulation 309K is a part of the arrangements necessary to implement appropriate security counter&hyphen;measures which are generally time critical. Any delay could substantially reduce the effectiveness of any industry&hyphen;wide threat response. Because such a direction is initiated by the Secretary and not requested by the agent, it may not be immediately transparent to the Secretary that a regulated agent is not complying with a direction issued under regulation 309K.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The intention is for the obligation under regulation 309F to be of a significantly less serious nature than the obligation under regulation 309K. An <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> agent's decision to `opt out' of the cargo scheme under regulation 309F is able to be fully addressed through administrative means and it is not necessary for criminal proceedings in such a case. However, administrative means are not available with a failure to comply with regulation 309K and it is necessary to create an offence for regulated agents failing to comply with this obligation. In view of the serious consequences (refusing to implement counter&hyphen;measures to a real threat to aviation), it is considered appropriate for the offence to contain a substantial pecuniary penalty.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Overview</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the present sittings the Committee maintained its non&hyphen;partisan scrutiny of the continuing large number of disallowable instruments of delegated legislation tabled in the Senate. In the course of the sittings the Committee scrutinised 1021 such instruments. Only 199 of these were in the Statutory Rules series, which are generally better drafted and presented than other series. This is a trend that has been evident for some years. The other 822 instruments were the usual heterogeneous collection of different series.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee acts on behalf of the Senate to scrutinise each of these instruments to ensure compliance with its four principles, which cover all aspects of personal rights and parliamentary propriety. If the Committee detects any breach of these principles it writes to the Minister or other law maker in respect of the apparent defect, asking that the instrument be amended or an explanation provided. If the breach appears serious then the Chairman of the Committee gives a notice of motion of disallowance in respect of the instrument. This allows the Senate, if it wishes, to disallow the instrument. This ultimate step is rarely necessary, however, as Ministers almost invariably take action which satisfies the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The concerns raised by the Committee are described below under each of the four principles which constitute its terms of reference.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Principle (a): Is delegated legislation in accordance with the statute?</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This principle is interpreted broadly by the Committee. Together with the Committee's fourth principle, it covers not only technical validity, but also every other aspect of parliamentary propriety.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Technical validity, however, is an important aspect of the Committee's work. For instance, in the absence of express authority in the enabling or another Act, delegated legislation may not itself <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2175"> delegate the power to legislate. This was a problem with four separate instruments, relating to purported authority to make rules, determinate dates and set the conditions of performance pay. Also, unless authorised by an Act, instruments which operate with prejudicial retrospectivity are void. Three instruments appeared to operate in this way, all of which affected people engaged in commercial operations. Unless authorised by an Act, instruments may not incorporate material as amended from time to time, other than an Act or regulations. One instrument, also affecting commercial operations, purported to incorporate not only Acts as amended but also Acts as replaced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any provisions relating to making instruments which are specific to a particular Act must be observed, as must the general law relating to such making. One instrument purported to be made under two provisions although it appeared that it could only be made under one or the other. One instrument could only be made by an authority, but it purported to be made by the Chairman of the authority. Another instrument gave no indication that lengthy and detailed mandatory requirements for making had been followed. Another instrument which the Act required to be made as soon as possible was made eight years later. An instrument required to be tabled as soon as possible after making was tabled more than six months after that date. Two Acts required a series of delegated legislation to be numbered consecutively in the order in which instruments were made, which was not done. One instrument purported to be made by one officer but was signed by another. Another instrument purported to amend an earlier instrument which had ceased to have effect because it was not tabled. Another purported to impose conditions on a process although there was no power to do so. The Explanatory Statement for another instrument advised that Australian law was unclear on whether a particular levy was a tax or a contractual payment. One instrument inadvertently advantaged some people. The Explanatory Statement for an amending instrument which corrected the errors advised that in the meantime the inadvertent provisions were administered as they were intended to provide, not as they actually provided.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee had concerns about aspects of other instruments. One instrument created an offence, but did not provide a monetary penalty. Another instrument set a maximum liability for specified torts, but did not determine whether this was for one or more tortious acts or whether the limit was for one or more claimants. One set of regulations repealed certain Australian international sanctions, while another related set suspended them. One instrument provided for blanket procedures, when specific procedures appeared to be more appropriate, while another provided for blanket procedures although two weeks earlier an instrument in the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> same series provided for a specific case. One instrument provided for a Commonwealth&hyphen;State agreement but did not mention mainland territories. Another instrument provided for commencement merely from March 1996 without a specific day in March.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many instruments provide for aspects of taxes and charges. These are scrutinised by the Committee to ensure that they comply with parliamentary propriety. The Explanatory Statements for a number of instruments did not advise of the basis for increases in taxes or, in one case, of a large and unexpected increase in fees. Another instrument provided for a certificate to cost $13.65 and a replacement certificate $270. The Committee also questioned a quarantine charge of $875,000 for any consignment of any animals for one year. One instrument increased a number of allowances by 35%, but increased a similar allowance by only 12%.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee scrutinises the technical drafting and presentation of delegated legislation, with the object of ensuring that its quality is not less than that of Acts. One instrument used permissive rather than mandatory expressions when providing for an intended benefit. Another included the same numbers twice in a table. One instrument included two identifier numbers, which have previously resulted in tabling under one number in the House of Representatives and under another in the Senate. Other instruments had no numbering. Some instruments were made after an apparent delay; one was made to address issues which arose nine months earlier, one was made one year after the events to which it refers, while another was made after such delay that relevant allowances were increased by one third. One instrument appeared to fail to effect its legislative intent. Other instruments included drafting errors and inaccurate references. One provided for an unusually wide power of delegation. Another included obsolete expressions such as fireman, lineman and laundryman. Others included vague and subjective expressions. The Explanatory Statements for several instruments did not advise that they were made to implement undertakings given to the Committee. The Explanatory Statement for another did not advise why a sunset provision was being extended.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Principle (b): Does delegated legislation trespass unduly on personal rights and liabilities?</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee interprets this principle widely, to cover every aspects of personal rights. For instance, the Committee ensures that prescribed processes are as open as possible. Concerns during the present sittings included one provision which provided for time limits within which some decisions, but not others, had to be made. Another provision provided for reasons for some decisions, but not others, to be given. One instrument provided for reasons to be given in a notice unless this was not in the public <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2176"> interest, but did not include a provision to inform the recipient in relevant cases why reasons were not given. Another provided for notification of some decisions, but not others. Another provision required some decisions, not others, to be made personally by the Minister. One instrument provided for refund of a dispute notification fee while another did not. Another instrument did not provide an opportunity for a person to respond to adverse material. Another provision did not provide a show cause process for a detrimental decision. Another instrument provided that a licence suspension ceased to have effect after 28 days but that the licence could then be suspended again.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also questions any apparent breaches of privacy. One instrument provided that certain privacy protections did not apply to information divulged to a Minister, thus diluting existing provisions. Another instrument required company officers to disclose their date and place of birth and, in other provisions, to disclose their date of birth. In respect of another instrument, the Committee asked whether the Privacy Commissioner had been consulted on amendments of the spent conviction scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee questions any provisions which may be harsh or unreasonable. A form of summons to witnesses made no reference to witnesses' expenses. Another instrument provided for a disparity in the level of allowances to witnesses, with the maximum and minimum amounts payable to those called because of their scientific skills and knowledge being greater than for those called for other reasons. One instrument granted qualified privilege to supervisors performing duties under business rules, with no indication of what constituted those rules. Another instrument provided only six days for employees to elect to change from one superannuation scheme to another. Another instrument, made on 26 February 1996, required a person to obtain an annotated certificate from authorities in Europe by 31 March 1996. One instrument gave public officials power to `discuss procedures' with employees, with a penalty of up to $5000 for people who did not permit this. Another instrument made inadequate provision for identification of public officials who could exercise wide powers. These inadequate provisions included only vague reference to identity documents, with no requirement for photographic identification. One series of instruments appeared to make inadequate provision for overtime allowances for Commonwealth employees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee ensures that individuals are not charged for costs which should be the responsibility of the Commonwealth. One instrument was unclear as to who should bear the costs of destructions of certain goods. Another was unclear about the costs of an agreement with the Commonwealth. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Principle (c): Does delegated legislation make rights unduly dependent on administrative decisions which are not subject to independent review of their merits?</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Delegated legislation often provides for Ministers and other public officials to exercise discretions. Such discretions should be as narrow as possible, include objective criteria to limit the exercise of the discretion, and provide for appropriate review of the merits of a decision to an external, independent tribunal, which would normally be the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Two instruments included a double discretion. One granted a public official a discretion both to decide on the amount of an overpayment and then to decide on whether to repay it. The other granted the Minister, or in practice the Minister's delegate, a discretion both to decide on whether an activity is for certain purposes and then to decide whether to refund it. The Committee suggested that in both these instruments the first discretion should be subject to AAT review and the second discretion removed. Similarly, another instrument provided a discretion for a public official to waive certain payments if these were due to mistakes by officials. The Committee considered that in this case as well the discretion should be removed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One instrument provided for a discretion which would have an effect on superannuation payments. No criteria were provided to limit and guide the exercise of the discretion. The Explanatory Statement, however, advised that the discretion would only be exercised favourably if this was clearly justified in the particular circumstances. The Committee believes that such criteria should be included in the body of the instrument and, given the nature of both the discretion and the criteria in this case, that AAT review be provided. Another instrument provided for a public authority to revoke a licence `at any time and for any reason'. Here also the Committee considered that a discretion drafted in such a way should be subject to external review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some discretions had a particular effect on individuals. One instrument granted a discretion in relation to travel costs for training courses in respect of nursing homes. Another granted a discretion in respect of accreditation or withdrawal of accreditation to carry on a profession. Other instruments provided for discretions affecting the operation of businesses. One granted a discretion to decide on refunds, remissions or rebates of duty on fuel oil. Another granted a discretion to exempt an operator from an international air cargo security program, with no apparent AAT review, although AAT review was expressly available for other discretions provided for in the instrument. Another instrument also provided for reconsideration or review of some decisions, but not others, affecting <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2177"> woodchip licences. One instrument provided for decisions regarding storage of seized goods. Another discretion was to approve payments by means other than by EFT. Another related to overhaul of civil aviation equipment.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This principle is not often raised by the Committee. Nevertheless, it is an important safeguard affecting parliamentary propriety. One set of regulations provided for the modest penalty of $1000 for fishing boats which operated without a Tori Pole, which helps prevent sea birds, particularly the Wandering Albatross, from being caught on baited hooks. This penalty, although light, was the highest that could be imposed under the enabling provisions for the regulations. The Committee asked the Minister whether the offence could be provided for under the Act, which included penalties of $50,000.</PARA>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">HEALTH AND OTHER SERVICES (COMPENSATION) AMENDMENT BILL 1996</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Health and Other Services (Compensation) Amendment Bill 1996 amends theHealth and Other Services (Compensation) Act 1995 which came into effect on1 February 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That act was designed to prevent double dipping by people who receive Medicareor nursing home benefits which are subsequently covered by a compensation payment. The act requires compensation payers, such as insurance companies, to</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ensure that any due Medicare or nursing benefits are identified and repaid to the Commonwealth <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> before the claimant can receive their compensation settlement. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unfortunately, the early experience with the new scheme has revealed a number of problems which have caused some unacceptable delays in compensation claimants receiving their payments. This bill is designed to overcome these problems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has always been in agreement with the principles behind the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Act .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Double&hyphen;dipping is wrong and it is only proper that the government should be repaid for any benefits which are subsequently covered by a compensation payment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the government has always been concerned by the heavy&hyphen;handed and bureaucratic approach of the scheme devised by the former government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regrettably some of our worst fears have been realised with the first few months operation of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The delays being experienced by compensation claimants are causing real hardship and distress in many cases. While the Health Insurance Commission, under my direction, has made every possible effort to minimise delays, these efforts have been largely frustrated by the elaborate claim notification requirements of the original legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The former government could have prevented this situation if it had not rushed to introduce the bill in 1994&hyphen;95 with a minimum of consultation with those affected, particularly the legal profession and the insurance industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition have introduced into the House a Private Members Bill which seeks, in its own way, a mechanism to overcome the shortcomings of the original legislation. Whilst the government applauds the acknowledgement of the Opposition of its former failings, this attempt does not go far enough to fix the problems and provides little incentive for timely settlement of claims.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By contrast, this current bill introduced by the government is comprehensive and has been designed in consultation with the Insurance Council of Australia and several legal professional bodies, including the New South Wales Bar Association and the Law Society of New South Wales. These bodies support the principles of the scheme to prevent double dipping, but have been dismayed at the delays and the hardships caused as a consequence of some of the provisions of the original legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They have demonstrated a large amount of good will in working with this government to amended the previous government's act to make the scheme work as it should. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2186"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This government has worked speedily and constructively together to ensure that the government is repaid amounts owing without unduly disadvantaging compensation claimants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Current arrangements and problems </EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill establishes an alternative approach for compensation payers to ensure that the Commonwealth is repaid any monies owed for Medicare and nursing home benefits without delaying the payment of the bulk of the compensation amount to the claimant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill enables compensation payers to make an "advance payment" to the Health Insurance Commission upon finalisation of the claim and then immediately pay the remainder to the claimant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current arrangements rely on claimants obtaining a Notice of Charge from the Health Insurance Commission before their case is finalised either by court judgment or settlement. The Notice of Charge is compiled from information given to the Commission by the claimant and is valid for 3 months. Where the case is finalised without a current Notice of Charge, the insurer must withhold the compensation amount until the charge has been calculated and the amount repaid to the Health Insurance Commission. Under the current act, this can take up to 3 months.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Notice of Charge can take some time as it is essentially a three step process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, the Health Insurance Commission must send the claimant a list of all Medicare services since the date of the injury. The claimant has to indicate on the list which of the services relate specifically to that injury and return it to the Commission. At this point the Commission can issue the Notice of Charge.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For a variety of reasons it appears that a significant number of cases are being finalised without a current Notice of Charge. In some cases, the claimant's lawyer has not been aware of the new scheme, in other cases there has been misunderstanding about what precisely is required.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unfortunately, in many cases it has been delays at the Health Insurance Commission which have caused the problem. In the main, these delays are due to a much larger volume of claims than was expected when the scheme was designed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some of this increased volume has been caused by an anomaly in the act which unnecessarily required the notification of a large number of claims which predated the act and are not caught by its repayment provisions. This anomaly is also being addressed by the amendments in this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Advance payment provisions</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The advance payment provisions in this bill, give the parties another alternative for quicker settlement <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> when, for whatever reason, the case is finalised without a current Notice of Charge.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under these circumstances, this bill enables the insurer to pay ten percent (or another amount determined by the minister) of the compensation amount to the Health Insurance Commission as an advance payment against any debt owing. This must be done within 28 days of the judgment or settlement. The remaining 90 percent can then be paid to the claimant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In most cases, the withheld amount will exceed the amount owing. This arrangement will therefore not only give the claimant an incentive to settle the matter as quickly as possible but also ensure that the Commonwealth recovers the amounts owing as equitably as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where an advance payment is made, the Health Insurance Commission will send the claimant a list of all their services since the date of the injury. As with the current scheme, the claimant must then indicate to the Commission which of the services relate to the compensation injury. Where the amount owing is less than the advance payment held by the Commission, the difference must be refunded to the claimant. Where the amount owed is greater than the advance payment, the claimant has to pay the Commission the additional amount.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While this new alternative is beneficial as it will allow claimants who finalise without a Notice of Charge to receive the bulk of their compensation payment immediately, I should point out, that for claimants this is still an inferior course of action to that of obtaining the Notice of Charge BEFORE finalisation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the Notice is obtained before settlement, claimants will know the full extent of their debt to the Health Insurance Commission before they settle the case and they need have no further dealings with the matter; the insurer will make sure that the debt is paid before they receive the compensation amount.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, with the new advance payment option, claimants may not know the full extent of their debt to Medicare before settlement and they will be left to sort this out themselves at some later date. It could be 3 months or more before any refund is actually made. Further, because the usual practice at present is for claimants'lawyers to receive their payment from the settlement amount some claimants may not even have the benefit of legal assistance in these dealings. For this reason, the bill requires insurers to fully inform claimants of the possible consequences of the advance payment route before they are able to make such a payment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Experience with the early cases under the scheme is that the amount of benefits to be repaid to the Commonwealth is about 7 per cent on average of the compensation amount. Therefore in setting the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2187"> figure at 10 percent we are allowing a margin of about 50 percent above this average to ensure that in most cases the amount held will be sufficient to cover the debt.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unless there are other compelling reasons, any future variation to the amount of the advance payment should be in keeping with this principle.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill specifies that the advance payment option is only available where the total compensation amount is at least $3000. The administration of the advance payment scheme is such that it is not economic for it to be available for small claims. In these cases, it is hard to see a claimant could be significantly disadvantaged from the sorts of delays that are likely to occur with the current scheme. This amount can be varied by a determination of the minister which would be disallowable by the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill provides for the Managing Director of the Health Insurance Commission to be satisfied about the substantial truth of the statement made by the claimant as to which Medicare services relate to the injury in question before repaying any amount of the advance payment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Early experience with the scheme has shown that a handful of claimants are making statements which, on the face of it, are difficult to believe. One claimant for example, stated that she had no Medicare claims related to the injury even though</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">her Medicare records showed a large number of claims with dates of service commencing the day after the date of the injury. Many of these services, such as X&hyphen;rays were quite consistent with the type of injury in her compensation claim.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the advance payment arrangements, the risk of this type of false claim is slightly greater as many claimants will be completing the Section 18 statement without benefit of legal advice and may not be aware of the consequences should they make a false statutory declaration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where the Managing Director is not satisfied that the statement made by the claimant is substantially correct, the claimant must be notified of this in writing. Decisions made by the Managing Director in this regard are able to be reviewed by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Clarifying contradictions in the original act</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As mentioned before, this bill also contains a number of provisions which deal with some anomalies in the original act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to subsections 12(3), 12(4) and 13(2) essentially clarify the original intention of the act, which was that judgments, settlements and reimbursement arrangements which were entered into before the act commenced did not have to be notified to the Health Insurance Commission. This intention is reflected in Sub&hyphen;Sections 5(1) and (2) <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the original act, which say that the act does not apply to such amounts of compensation that were determined before the act commenced. However, even though no benefits can be recovered, the other provisions require the notices to be given.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Conclusion</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In conclusion, this bill will make the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Act work as it should. It will ensure that the government is repaid for any Medicare and nursing home benefits which are subsequently covered by a compensation payment. Above all, this bill will remove any unnecessary delays in compensating claimants.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS (NORTHERN TERRITORY) AMENDMENT BILL 1996</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill reflects the commitment of this government to securing legitimate title to traditional lands on behalf of the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 provides a mechanism whereby traditional Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory referred to in Schedule 1 of that act may be granted to Aboriginal Land Trusts to hold title on behalf of Aboriginal people. Since the act came into operation in 1977 a total of 60 separate parcels of land have been scheduled under the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the effect of this bill would be to bring within the Schedule to the Land Rights Act that area of land which is the subject of the Bauhinia Downs Land Claim. The Northern Territory Government, the Northern Land Council and Claimants in the Land Claim have entered into an agreement which settles that Land Claim. As part of that agreement the Northern Territory Government agreed to request the Commonwealth to exercise its powers under the Land Rights Act to grant the claim area, excluding the Borroloola to Roper Bar Road, to the traditional owners by scheduling that area under the Land Rights Act. The result of such scheduling would be that no further hearing or report by the Aboriginal Land Commissioner would then be necessary in order for the Aboriginal people concerned to be able to have the full rights of enjoyment of their traditional lands in fee simple.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the government has the assurance of all parties to the negotiations that representative views of all Aboriginal people concerned have been obtained and their wishes taken into account.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the approach of the centenary of Federation and the opportunity to consider constitutional changes and the shape of Australian society into the next millennium, the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (16 and 17 Year Old Voluntary Enrolment) Bill 1996 seeks to make one crucial change in the way in which young people participate in our society. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2189"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides for 16 and 17 year olds to take up the option of enrolling to vote in federal elections. This would not be a mandatory requirement, but an option for those who wish to exercise it. However, once enrolled, people who choose the option, would be compelled to vote in the same manner as now exists for those on the roll.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is the substance of the bill, and I want now to say something about the thinking behind it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Throughout history there have been numerous occasions when people have sought to redress imbalances of power, or a lack of a voice in their society. Examples which come to mind include the American revolution, with its slogan of "no taxation without representation", which is most apt in relation to this bill, and the movement for womens suffrage in various parts of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I cannot claim that there is a revolutionary spirit in the country over this issue at present, but it may well be that this parliament could take a lead for change in considering this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is, however, a compelling argument for change to the Electoral Act so that young people in this country can achieve a greater sense of belonging and participation in the decisions which affect their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The previous government took up the issue of active citizenship and, at times, floated the idea that a greater commitment to education about citizenship should be taught in schools. However, this did not seem to extend to changing that most fundamental of all indicators of citizenship for young people by giving them the right to vote.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian history shows examples of occasions when the difference in age between civic duty and voting age was bridged in recognition of the contribution being made by some young people. I am referring, of course, to the provision for a lower voting age for service personnel engaged in overseas combat during World War II and during the Malaysian emergency in the 1960s.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But war is an extreme example. There are many other areas of community life in which young people are routinely involved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Young people under the age can be married, they can leave home, obtain a driver's licence and they are required to pay taxes on their income. They are able to apply to Social Security for benefits on their own cognisance, they can be (and often are) questioned by police and can be required to answer charges in court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As we prepared this bill, my staff and I sought information on other countries where 16 and 17 year olds are able to vote. We found that both Brazil and Nicaragua allow this age group to vote for the national assembly, and that it has been raised as a matter for serious community debate in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> New Zealand, South Africa and Canada, where it was considered in the context of a Royal Commission on Electoral Reform. The South Australian Government has the matter under consideration, as is also the case with a group of members of the ACT Legislative Assembly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Young people want to be active participants in the Australian community. Sadly, at a number of levels, the potential of their contribution has been blunted by an inability to gain access to the means of involvement. While the community is content to allow young people some of the marks of being part of the mainstream, such as driver's licence, some benefits and the right to seek work, there is an increasing sense of alienation on the part of young people. It is my belief that a great deal of that alienation is due to their absolute or practical exclusion from some of the more significant marks of citizenship.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Too many of our young people are unemployed, thus casting them into the social security system. Too many come in for unnecessary attention from police because of their use of public places in their leisure time. Too many are finding that, even if they can find a place in a training program, the program leads nowhere.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of course, it is not possible to solve all these problems by means of this bill to alter the Electoral Act. However, the change proposed in the bill would provide a means by which one aspect of this alienation could be redressed. But I believe that the involvement of young people in the electoral processes of this country would bring about many positive changes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A positive consequence of such a change would be the emphasis it would give to young people when political parties are formulating policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will give them standing in such policy areas as provision of legal services for young people, labour market programs and education.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similarly, political parties, and governments, will need to focus greater attention on voter education in schools, which will have positive spin&hyphen;offs for the whole community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training in 1988, commenting on the issue of `active citizenship', had this to say</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"An active citizen in the committee's view is someone who not only believes in the concept of a democratic society but who is willing and able to translate that belief into action . . . . and a conviction that active participation is the right of all citizens."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I'm sure that all honourable senators would agree that amongst the hallmarks of young people are convictions, energy and a desire to be involved in action.   <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2190"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Youth Policy and Action Coalition argues that the sort of participation discussed by the Committee includes voting, when it says</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Perhaps the strongest argument in favour of lowering the voting age is that it would reverse the trend in recent years to scapegoat young people for various social problems. It would redress a power imbalance which makes young people easy targets for politicians who want to make a name for themselves . . . . It might just help reduce some of the alienation which the political exclusion of young people currently causes."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of course, whenever this issue is raised, some will argue that young people don't know enough about the political processes to vote responsibly. We are told that they are not mature enough to exercise the right to vote well. Clearly political wisdom is not somehow conferred on people in some magic ceremony on their eighteenth birthday, it is a developmental process, like all other learning processes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More importantly, if understanding of our system of government and our political processes is to be considered a pre&hyphen;requisite, many thousands of adults may be disqualified.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Indeed, a number of surveys have indicated a very high level of understanding of these issues among young people, and the New Zealand Royal Commission on the Electoral System in 1986 specifically rejected the notion that young people lack the capacity to make political judgements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As an exercise, I had the parliamentary research service provide an estimate of how many people aged 16 and 17 years would have been eligible to vote in the elections in March this year.

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(f)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the Government's management and implementation of its decision to abolish the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>This motion refers to the development import finance facility, universally known by its <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> initials and acronym DIFF. This is a scheme which provides for soft loans in the form of aid basically for infrastructure and environmentally friendly development in developing countries, principally in the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region. On 15 February in a document entitled `Meeting our commitments' released by Mr Costello, now the Treasurer, the present government indicated that it would abolish the DIFF scheme and replace it with a concessional loan scheme at some future time. Since then, and as recently as yesterday, on several occasions the government has confirmed on the public record that the scheme is to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an important scheme. The government's handling of its announcement of its intention to abolish the scheme and its vagueness about what it might do are matters of national comment, national notoriety and, in my view, national disgrace. This scheme ought to remain. It is an important scheme for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think we have ever seen before in the field of foreign affairs a conjunction of so many organisations, interest groups and foreign countries opposed to and putting their opposition on the record concerning the abolition of the scheme. A range of organisations has made it clear that if this scheme were to be removed it would be a tragedy for Australia, a tragedy for Australian companies, a tragedy for Australian industry at large, a tragedy for our Asian neighbours and a tragedy for those unemployed people who are looking for employment in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason for moving for an inquiry into this matter is that I believe strongly the public has a right to know what the virtues of this scheme are and what the criticisms of it might be. It will provide at a committee level an opportunity for the government to try to justify what I think is frankly a stupid act, as it has been called by respected national commentators. It will also allow us to deal with the bungling efforts of the government to implement this scheme and the misleadings that appear to have occurred in the House of Representatives by the responsible minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not a light matter. The former head of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, one of Australia's most respected <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2193"> former diplomats, Richard Woolcott, has condemned the government on the abolition of the scheme. Mr Woolcott is a considered person. He is in many respects the diplomat emeritus for Australia; a premier foreign representative for this country, distinguished at the United Nations and elsewhere, and is well known for his discretion and temperate language. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 14 June a letter was reported from Mr Woolcott to Mr Howard. Mr Woolcott said a number of things in that letter which can only be taken as quite frank and outright opposition to what the government is doing. From someone whose language is temperate, these words are indeed bullets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The essence of Mr Woolcott's letter is that the federal government's decision to scrap the development import finance facility would undermine Australia's credibility, offend neighbouring governments and harm Australia's competitiveness. The letter dated 4 June was to Mr Andrew Thomson, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. In that letter Mr Woolcott argued that the government should reverse its election commitment to abolish the DIFF because it contradicts the larger commitment that the government made of making closer ties to the region the government's top foreign priority. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As things stand Mr Howard's and Mr Downer's rhetoric about closer engagement with Asia has been eroded by this action and our credibility and reputation for reliability in the region will suffer, especially in the Philippines following understandings reached during President Ramos's visit last August.</PARA>
<PARA>For his pains there has been what one could only describe as an attempt to besmirch Mr Woolcott's motives. However, that has rebounded on those who have attempted to do so. He is not alone in his opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of industry associations have condemned the abolition of DIFF as an effort in cutting off your nose to spite your face. This is a scheme that generates contracts for Australian companies, puts them in a premier position in the world to win further contracts and is responsible for a number of leading Australian companies becoming more effective in Asia and winning contracts in their <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> own right. The best example of that is Clough Engineering, the chairman of which is a former president of the Liberal Party in Western Australia and the chairman of the Liberal Party's review group in that state. His company has distinguished itself&mdash;and all credit to him and his company&mdash;by using the scheme intelligently, and it has gone further to win other contracts in Asia to build Australia's participation in that booming market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This decision by the government has been universally condemned by business and industry associations around Australia. All media commentators have been opposed to it. I have scanned the media, and not one commentary can I find anywhere in which anyone has had a positive word for the government. These are distinguished independent media commentators. Perhaps the most succinct summary of the media's view appeared in the editorial of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> last Thursday, 20 June. The headline reads `The DIFF should be preserved'. The opening paragraph of that editorial which summarises its position succinctly reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Government has made a big mistake with its decision to end the concessional aid program known as the Development Import Finance Facility. If it is truly serious about closer engagement with Asia being its highest foreign policy priority, it should reverse its course by restoring the scheme and its budget for 1996-97.</PARA>
<PARA>The editorial then deals in considerable detail with its concerns about the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If they were the only voices raised in protest, then there would be a cacophony of protest from within Australia. But protest about this government reaches beyond our shores. A number of distinguished ambassadors accredited to this capital representing nations from the Asia-Pacific area have also raised their voices on the public record in Australia. Many of them put their views privately to the government before doing so, as one would expect from ambassadors. The ambassadors of the People's Republic of China, of Vietnam, of the republic of Indonesia, and of the Philippines have all entreated the government on the public record not to proceed with its ill&hyphen;advised intentions to terminate this scheme.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2194">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They point to the value of the scheme in their own nations. They illustrate in their remarks&mdash;and there are so many of them that I will not go to each individual one&mdash;the immense damage that will be done to Australia's reputation in the region if this scheme is abolished. They go further in their muted ambassadorial language to refer to the bungling efforts of this government to terminate the scheme when a number of companies are currently in the throes of developing contracts and will have those contracts terminated while in mid stride. That of course raises questions in the region of Australia's reputation for reliability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Asian region many things have been written about business ethics and business behaviour. Of all of those comments, one thing can be distilled from them: in this region a premium is placed on trust and honesty. Indeed, many contracts survive because people know and understand the reliability of individuals and of companies. So, when you lose a contract because you have not honoured it or you terminate a contract such as this, it calls into question trust and honesty. It also means that Australia does not start again from zero. It starts from a handicapped position well behind zero because, once a quality such as trust is lost, the efforts to regain trust are of Pavlovian dimensions. You have to succeed in proving trust at least nine to 11 times before anyone would ever believe that you are a trustworthy person. For this government to terminate those projects, in the future its reputation faces that sort of hurdle in Asian eyes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not just the ambassadors. If it were, perhaps the government would try to square its account with them. They are faithful message carriers for their host governments as well. We now know from the public record that a number of ministers in foreign governments have raised this question directly with Australia. We have had the notorious example covered in question time and censure motions in the House of Representatives just this week regarding Madam Wu Yi and her vice&hyphen;minister's letter to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer, in which she raised questions about the scheme. We know from what <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> has been adduced under questioning in the House that at least two ministers in Indonesia&mdash;Mr Ginandjar and Mr Habibie&mdash;have raised this matter directly with the government as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have here a copy of a letter dated 13 June from Jakarta under the signature of Minister Habibie in which he refers to a major project that would have attracted DIFF and raises an entreaty with the government that, given the importance of this project to Indonesia, the DIFF scheme should be extended in some way for this project at the very least. Coming from a government of a major developing country like Indonesia and our most important nearest neighbour, that is a major question in its own right. It certainly underlines the significance of the DIFF scheme that that government sees, and it underlines the importance of particular projects that go to assistance in developing our nearest neighbour along the path from being a developing country to being a partly and ultimately developed country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This letter from Mr Habibie carries other significance too. Mr Habibie&mdash;or, giving him his proper title, Dr Habibie&mdash;is a significant figure in Indonesia. The press often write of him as a future president of that nation. What is certainly true is that he is a distinguished scientist in his own right, quite an impressive person, a major public figure in Indonesia and someone with a great deal of influence who could easily succeed at being appointed as president at whatever time it is that President Suharto chooses to retire, if he does.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well, Dr Habibie is a friend of Australia. He came as a guest of the Australian government last year. His importance in the trade relationship between Indonesia and Australia, particularly in what Australia can contribute to that relationship in technology and in science based products and services, is quite significant. He appreciates our value. His raising these questions directly with the government comes from not just any minister. This is a senior figure in the whole of the Asia-Pacific region, a distinguished public figure and scientist in his own right and someone whose voice should be listened to. Those entreaties from our nearest neighbours <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2195"> and our most important regional associates have been overlooked by this government. One needs to get to the bottom of why they see that as being something that they can blithely flick off in the manner in which the Minister for Foreign Affairs seems to have chosen to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is good reason why all of these people have stood up and spoken out in support of this scheme. That good reason can be simply encapsulated by saying this is a scheme which works and which is effective. Destroying something that works and is effective and that greases the wheels of fraternal and good relations in the region for a win-win outcome, both for the developing country and for Australian industry and Australian government, is the silliest of things that one could imagine. It has two-way benefits. Over 700 projects have been funded under this scheme, and all of them are vastly appreciated by the partners who have joined together to make those projects successful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another interesting and important dimension of the scheme and one that needs particular commentary, I think, concerns the innovation by the previous Labor government under the ministerial control of now Mr Gordon Bilney for the introduction of green DIFF. One knows that in the Asia-Pacific area, where the pressure is often on governments to take development at any price, matters of environmental damage do occur. One knows that those governments are placed in an intolerable dilemma. They are often faced with having to decide whether they should plumb for projects which will create economic growth, jobs for their underemployed population and development for their nation or whether they should plumb for the environmental elements that sometimes those projects might endanger. That is a terrible and intolerable position for those governments to be placed in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So green DIFF to encourage development in the environmental area is quite a significant innovation and an important one for Australia, which takes its corporate responsibility in the world on matters environmental as being a high priority, a first priority. If those projects about water purification, about greenhouse gas <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> emissions and about other elements of environmental degradation in those nations were to be undercut because of the removal of green DIFF, that would be a blow to the global ecology and to the ecology of this region. This government waxes lyrical about its so-called environmental credentials but engages in a blackmail over Telstra. Here is one area in which it could prove its environmental credentials, if it so chose; but it chooses not to by cutting this scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those countries faced with the dilemma of creating jobs at the risk of environmental degradation are faced with the possibility of pollute&hyphen;now&hyphen;and&hyphen;pay&hyphen;later development. The DIFF scheme plays an important role in ameliorating those terrible choices those countries are faced with, and green DIFF in its own right should stand no matter what.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the worst feature of what the government has proposed, and one of the matters that need to be inquired into further and which this inquiry would allow, is the impact on the viability of companies currently engaged in the DIFF program. There are currently 52 projects in the DIFF pipeline for 1996-97 and beyond. These projects have already been formally agreed to in bilateral aid consultations between Australia and foreign officials.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition AusAID, our foreign aid agency, has provided letters of advice to Australian companies in respect of these projects and has asked them to prepare project feasibility studies. In other words, a number of Australian companies have invested their capital in winning these contracts. Having won them, these companies are being asked to take those contracts to the feasibility stage, which involves these companies in outlays. These companies are now to be cut off. They are to lose the money they have outlaid and the investments they have made in good faith under an understanding of this scheme continuing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fifty-two projects around the region are not projects to be lightly sneered at. Of the 52 projects, $67 million has been expended to date. Eighteen of those projects are in China, 16 are in Indonesia, seven are in the Philippines and five are in Vietnam. Those 52 <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2196"> projects have a DIFF value of $379 million and a contract value of $1,082 million. So, by those figures, we can see the magnitude of damage being visited on Australian companies gratuitously by this government. It has an impact on these companies' viability in the local market as well as internationally, with implications for employment and job availability for Australians&mdash;not to mention the damage it does to foreign relations within the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The loss of contracts valued at $1,082 million is not something that this government&mdash;which has promoted its concern about the current account deficit, a reasonable and proper concern, as being one of its centrepieces of economic policy&mdash;can walk away from. Under DIFF Australian companies lever themselves into contracts which help the current account deficit improve and which lead those companies, having established their bona fides in the region, on to other contracts which improve the current account deficit as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If a government is dinkum about its concern on the current account deficit, it would not cut DIFF and it would not expose Australian companies to the financial risk and Australian workers to job loss that cutting DIFF would do. So the inquiry should look at what major financial damage is inflicted on Australian companies, what loss of jobs this will potentially create and actually create and what damage it does to our image abroad when we do not keep our word that we are reliable, when trust in Asia is a vital and necessary ingredient in business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not as if the only country with a scheme such as this is Australia. One of the things that are true about the Australian economy now is that it is increasingly globalised. Therefore Australian companies have to succeed not only in a globalised economy which is our domestic economy but also in a globalised economy which is the economy of our region and of the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If Australian companies with access to DIFF are denied that particular advantage, then countries that provide DIFF style or soft loan schemes to their own companies&mdash; <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> countries such as Italy, France, Germany, Japan and a number of other countries&mdash;will take contracts off Australian companies simply because the playing field is not level. In the international arena it is unequal. Developed countries&mdash;the European countries I have named and Japan&mdash;are very fond of providing particular assistance to their companies operating in the world in order to encourage them to win contracts against all comers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">DIFF is not conceived to be a particular device by which you beat those countries, but the truth is that it works that way as well as achieves its particular aid and developmental objectives. To disarm Australian companies unilaterally in the face of others that remain armed by those industry support schemes means that this government would run up the white flag and say, `Australia won't be competitive. We won't assist. We won't match some of the others, therefore we are bound to lose.' Goodwill being damaged by the abolition of the scheme will mean that, if all things are equal but our prices are a bit higher, goodwill will not save us, because we have lost trust by the abolition of the scheme and other countries support their industry far better than Australia does.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned the current account deficit. I mentioned that this government has on the chopping block three other major things that help our trade as well as DIFF. I mention them now, but in passing. The export market development scheme, we understand, is slated for complete removal. The ITS scheme is also slated to go that way, despite the fact that it is a loan based scheme and not a direct outlay under the outlays side of the budget. We know that the Expenditure Review Committee of this government on 4 June imposed on Austrade a 24.3 per cent cut in running costs, thus meaning a cut of one quarter to the Austrade running costs budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Austrade is a labour intensive agency that is an intelligence network for Australian business in the world, spotting market opportunity for Australian business. If you slash it by that amount, you reduce the reach of Australian business international intelligence to win market opportunity around the world <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2197"> and thus undermine efforts by Australian companies to turn back the current account deficit. It is a bit like starting Cathy Freeman in the 400 metres in Atlanta in Blundstone boots and saying to her: `The extra weight you are carrying on your feet is an incentive to work harder to win your event.' It is a total and utter nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My final point concerns the bungling manner in which this government has gone about the abolition of the scheme. It knows it is doing something unpopular. Rather than face the music squarely, tell the truth and accept constructive criticism, there has been an effort by the Foreign Minister (Mr Downer) at least, and maybe by others, to try to hide the facts from the Australian community. On this basis alone there is a clear case for an inquiry into these events.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen in the media this week the struggling efforts by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to try to work out how many angels can dance on the head of a pin&mdash;in other words, to engage in very fine rhetoric to pretend he did not mislead the House of Representatives when he said that he had not received opposition by ministers in other countries to the abolition of the DIFF scheme. We saw him duck and weave when a letter was produced from a vice minister from the People's Republic of China on behalf of their minister for economic development and foreign trade, Madam Wu Yi. We saw him look flabbergasted and confounded in the face of the advice from ministers Ginandjar and Habibie, from the Republic of Indonesia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The best summary that I can bring to mind of his performance was that on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> last night when in editorial comment the reporter Barry Cassidy gave the view that even if you believe&mdash;and it takes some stretch of the imagination to do this&mdash;the tortuous explanations of Mr Downer, then the explanation itself proves that he is incompetent. If the first ground does not hold, the ground of incompetence holds and he should go as a minister. Therefore, that an inquiry to set the record straight, to give Mr Downer a chance to come clean for the Australian people so we can learn the facts of who advised whom, when and where, what was said and what <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> misleadings did occur is an important element of this inquiry. Under the last item&mdash;the government's management and implementation of its decision to abolish the scheme&mdash;an inquiry will be worthwhile and will help shine a light on these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My final reason for wanting an inquiry into this event is best described by the efforts we have made through the normal forums of this chamber to find out more and better information with the DIFF scheme. On 20 May this year I asked Senator Short a question in question time about what the government's intentions were. Let me go to that question. The first question was: `Are you aware that Japanese, German, French and Italian companies will now be rejoicing at your government's decision to abolish the DIFF system because of the benefits flowing to them at the expense of Australian companies as a result of this decision?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second question was quite direct: `Don't you agree that the DIFF scheme would have helped position Australian companies to win some of this work, but that that will now not happen?' The third question was: `What bids for contracts by Australian companies are now in jeopardy because DIFF is to be axed? How many jobs are entailed?' The last question was: `What effect will the loss of these contracts have on our trade position and the current account deficit?' They are questions seeking information. They are questions seeking fact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What answer did the opposition receive from the Assistant Treasurer? We received an answer, if one can dignify it by the word `answer', which just retailed a lot of economic gobbledegook and never answered the question. This is a favourite performance of Senator Short. No information was given to this chamber. Information was sought through the proper forum of question time. None was given. If the question time forum does not work, then the Senate has no alternative but to go to an inquiry to elucidate the facts.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government will oppose the motion. We do not believe that this is a genuine attempt to examine DIFF or mixed credits generally. This is purely an attempt by the opposition to attack the Foreign Minister, Mr Downer. I do not think there is any doubt about that. It is demonstrated by the fact that it is introduced into the Senate in the last week of sitting, although this issue has been on the table for the whole of this parliamentary session.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the opposition genuinely wanted the issues of DIFF  and its placement in the aid program considered by the parliament, we would have heard about it months ago. But they see a window of opportunity to attack Mr Downer at the moment. They now want to use the Senate committee process as a vehicle to further that attack. That is an abuse of the Senate committee process, which is here to enable the Senate to explore public policy options, and that is not the intention of the opposition in this regard at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously, the government has to decide what it can afford with the foreign aid vote and the construction of the foreign aid contribution. We criticised DIFF in the lead&hyphen;up to the election. DIFF is a subsidy at taxpayers' expense towards public infrastructure programs in developing countries. It enables Australian companies to bid for those programs. Basically, it means that the taxpayer is being asked to contribute approximately $140 million this year to Australian business to subsidise its investment overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The extent to which the taxpayer should be supporting Australian business investment is an issue that is open to debate. The government has been confronted with a very serious budgetary situation and it has determined that DIFF is not a sensible option for the Australian taxpayer at this time. I will take a step <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> back and trace the events leading to this situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government went to the people with a detailed, costed program that would, in part, enable a budget surplus to be achieved and which also recognised the pain and suffering that so many Australians have experienced during the recession and the years since the recession. We acknowledged up front that in some areas of public expenditure there would have to be cuts. We detailed the cuts&mdash;the programs and the costs. DIFF was one of them. It was debated during the course of the election campaign. I can remember debating it in business forums at that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true, Senator Cook, that some businesses were unhappy with the concept of our cutting a subsidy to business. That is not surprising. But businesses were also saying to us, which is even more important, that they wanted us to get public expenditure down so that we could provide for them the best possible economic parameters in which to operate. In other words, business wanted us to keep interest rates, taxation and inflation down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Business knew that we could not do that if we continued down the path of the previous government, which was high expenditure paid for by increases in taxation, particularly increases in borrowings for which the whole community, including business, would have to pay. That resulted in Australia becoming uncompetitive in so many areas, and that is the real burden upon Australian business wanting to invest within the Asian region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Business said to us that a greater priority was getting those economic fundamentals right. It acknowledged that we would have to cut public expenditure to do that. Some businesses said that they would prefer that it not be in an area in which they receive subsidies, but that is just human nature.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The important point is that this debate was had at the time of the election. The areas of expenditure cuts were on the table, as were the new areas of increased expenditure. In other words, in addition to getting the economic parameters right, we wanted to give something back, through taxation assistance in particular, to the Australian families who <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2199"> have suffered so much in recent years. We wanted to give something back in health care and in those other areas with which we are all so familiar. Both sides of the ledger were set out in great detail at the time of the election. There was nothing hidden about DIFF; it was part of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After the election we found that the economic facts of life were much worse than had been revealed at the time of the election. We found that we had an additional $8,000 million to make up. In other words, there was an undisclosed budget deficit in the forecast of some $8 billion. I make that point only to demonstrate how much more difficult it is now to retrace our steps and to exclude areas of public expenditure cuts detailed at the time of the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was put to us today that we should abandon our intention to cut expenditure in this regard. It is impossible for us to abandon detailed areas of expenditure cuts while at the same time meeting the extra deficit burden of another $8,000 million in savings. That is the problem that the government faces, and the opposition parties in this place are very familiar with it. We cannot break the promise we made in this instance. A Senate inquiry, even if it were a genuine attempt to build upon public knowledge, would not be able to influence us to do that in any event.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next point I want to make is that for years we have been told, particularly by the Greens and the Australian Democrats&mdash;and all the NGOs in the aid world&mdash;that DIFF was not good aid. They said that subsidising Australian business was not the best way in which to spend the Australian aid vote; that the priority should be the areas of poverty alleviation, small scale development, primary health care, multilateral and bilateral humanitarian aid, and so on. We were told that a subsidy to Australian business appearing within the aid vote distorted our aid contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In many ways, in determining our priorities within the aid vote, and while recognising that there would have to be cuts, we were responding to the demands of the Australian aid community. We are not embarrassed that we have given priority to areas such as policy <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> alleviation. We believe that the vast majority of the Australian people would support us in that choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I could go on, but there is legislation and other things before the Senate that need to be done. If I had time, I could develop the argument that Australia's DIFF contribution has not been well spent under the previous government. Senator Cook would know that one year it gave every dollar to one Australian company. Senator Cook would know the whole depressing legacy of Labor's attempt to introduce mega&hyphen;DIFFs, in which it was going to expend the money on just one or two huge projects. It was another one of these attempts by former Labor prime ministers to attach themselves to grand overseas developments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's contribution through DIFF has not been an overall happy experience, apart from the issues that I have already raised. We have said that there is an argument for a reformed mixed credit scheme, and we have committed ourselves to examine the detail of that and to come back in due course with proposals for a more efficient and better targeted scheme of concessional finance. In due course, we will do that, but, in the meantime, we intend to stand by our promise, and that means we have made our decisions of choice and we have made our choices within the aid vote. We have made our choices, difficult though they might be, as to where we should be cutting public expenditure to achieve the overall economic benefits that are so important to all taxpayers, including Australian business that is seeking to invest in Asia, and we will be standing by those choices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We regret, as I said at the outset, that the Senate is being used in this way&mdash;simply to achieve another short&hyphen;term political gain of the opposition, and that is to attack one of the government's ministers rather than to get about work that could lead to changes in public policy that could be to the betterment of public administration generally.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do agree with one thing that Senator Hill has just said, and that is that the Australian Democrats have been saying&mdash;I <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2200"> have been saying it for six years&mdash;that DIFF should not be included in development aid; it should be in another area. We suggested trade and industry as another area it should be included in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I do not see development aid mentioned at all in this committee reference. The point that has been made is a valid one, and I make it again: DIFF should not have been included as part of our development aid program; our development aid should have been humanitarian aid, and that is what should have got us up to 0.7 per cent of GNP. At the moment, with DIFF having been taken out, I think we go back to about 0.28 per cent or 0.29 per cent, which is just outrageous when you consider that the United Nations has a target of 0.7 per cent. With DIFF included, I think we are up to about 0.35 per cent. Everybody gives a guarantee that we will be up to 0.5 per cent within a couple of years, and we just keep going down, and that is outrageous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, let me make the point that development aid is not mentioned here. It is not in the terms of reference of this committee inquiry. The inquiry will be looking into the proposed abolition of this scheme, a mixed credit scheme, and how that is going to affect various things in the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to foreshadow a move to amend the motion to add an extra section to it. That extra section would read, `The extent to which the DIFF could be further refined to assist developing countries in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.' The reason I would like to put that in is that, specifically, the Bureau of Industry Economics has released a report today which says that Australia could make a massive contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by assisting developing countries in the reduction of those greenhouse gas emissions because we have such good technology in this area. I think that is something else that the committee could, very profitably, have a look at, and I will be moving that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The comment by the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) that the government is looking at a reformed mixed credit scheme is a good one. I hope that it looks at it in terms of trade rather than aid, and my <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> firm hope, from what he has said, is that the government intends to increase humanitarian aid. I look forward to seeing a schedule for when it intends to get up to 0.7 per cent of GNP. It is not going to be easy from 0.28 per cent or 0.29 per cent, whatever we are on now, but I look forward to it finding some more humanitarian aid and money for that in the very near future.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There have been some interesting points made in today's debate. I was very pleased to hear the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Hill) saying that the emphasis by the government is, or will be, on humanitarian aid. I think that is very worthy, and I would like to think that that will be the case. We will certainly be making sure that the aid that is provided is going towards those causes. Basically, the Greens (WA) believe that we do ourselves no good in concentrating aid on assisting business in Australia. In the case of many of our aid programs&mdash;if we look, for instance, at Africa, which has not received a great deal of aid from Australia&mdash;unfortunately, the aid is in inverse proportion to the social, environmental and other needs of the countries involved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Basically, the richer countries get more aid; the poorer  countries get left off. That has been a very unfortunate aspect. I would like to think that what Senator Hill has said today is an indication of a change in that&mdash;that we will actually be looking at the needs of countries rather than the necessary prospects of return from emerging middle classes in the countries to whom we provide aid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also true, as Senator Hill has indicated, that the Greens, as well as the Australian Democrats, have been very vocal in criticising the levels that have been used in the past in schemes like DIFF as aid and been part of the aid budget. It is also true that the non-government aid groups have been very critical, and they have pushed, as far as they could, for DIFF to be used in ways that are of greater benefit to the communities involved. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2201"> There has been a move towards green DIFF, which many people have welcomed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In supporting the motion, we are not saying that DIFF is the best thing since sliced bread, but that elements of DIFF definitely need support and critical analysis. That is why we asked for, and got, the motion to indicate that we would look at the contribution by DIFF to Australia's aid objectives. That is important because it will also give the Australian aid community, the non&hyphen;government aid community in particular, the opportunity to put their views to the committee on the contribution DIFF has made and can make to Australia's legitimate aid objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In supporting the motion, we are not endorsing, necessarily, all DIFF has done. Rather, we are endorsing the necessity of this chamber to do what it should do, that is, to look at the government's expenditure program. It is a very welcome opportunity to look at Australia's aid objectives, particularly DIFF, to see whether we are meeting them. So it is a vehicle for having a very fruitful discussion, and it is pleasing to think that we will have that. From our point of view, it is not a means of simply making cheap political points. It is demeaning to think that we would support the motion simply for that reason.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Undoubtedly, we have put a lot on the record about the aid program. It is the right time for us to consider any changes to government expenditure programs. It is the legitimate role of the Senate to review government expenditure programs, any proposed cuts to expenditure programs and the impacts those will have. That is what people expect us to do and that is why we will support this motion today.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise as a member of the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee. Much as Senator Cook attempted to dress up this motion as a genuine inquiry, the fact that it is being brought on in the last sitting week of this particular session with a reference to report back to the Senate on the first day of the budget sitting indicates that it simply would not be possible for a Senate committee to do justice to this inquiry, given the very wide&hyphen;ranging terms of reference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Cook would be well aware that other senators will be engaged during the coming parliamentary break in other major references which have been designed to delay and frustrate government legislation, and that those references to other committees of other legislation are on such major planks of government policy as Telstra and IR. All senators will be very fully occupied in looking at those references in other committees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Look at just one clause, (d), of Senator Cook's motion, `the impact on Australia's international relations in the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region'. That would require a detailed and extensive Senate inquiry. It simply would not be possible for this committee to deal with that part of the reference alone in the very limited time frame that he has recommended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only that, the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee has had several major inquiries over recent times. When the Senate resumes, it will have to deal with a major inquiry concerning the `appropriateness and effectiveness of the Australian government's provision of consular assistance to Australians abroad'. That alone will be a major inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also very possible that Senator Cook does not want the committee to proceed at the moment with this inquiry which, doubtless, could bring a great deal of discredit to the actions of his former government. Perhaps that is why he has moved that the committee conduct this other inquiry into the DIFF scheme. The China report, which I understand the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee tabled this week, has been delayed through other reports, and the air links report, which is also due for completion, has occupied the committee to a great extent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Considering the present workload, it would be difficult for the committee to handle a reference of such immensity. Very little notice was given of this reference, even though, as Senator Hill has already remarked, the knowledge of the government's action on the DIFF scheme has been well and truly flagged since before the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Cook's last line in his speech summed it up when he said he intends to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2202"> bring the minister to account. In other words, it is a `Get Alexander Downer' exercise rather than any genuine desire to look at the DIFF scheme as it has existed and the role that it should play in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Cook thinks he can expand the four&hyphen;minute answer, which I am sure he was given in a very satisfactory manner by Senator Short, to a full&hyphen;scale inquiry. He wants to use that answer as part of the basis for his alleged inquiry because he was not satisfied with the answer given by Senator Short. So we move from the four&hyphen;minute answer given by a minister in question time to a fully&hyphen;fledged, full&hyphen;scale inquiry into the DIFF scheme and only, probably, Senator Cook could do this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would emphasise that the committee is in no state to undertake this inquiry at the moment. It is a political stunt by Senator Cook to camouflage any further inquiries into his own government's mismanagement. It is a political exercise aimed at a particular minister, rather than a genuine exploration of policy.</PARA></SPEECH>

On that last point, however, raised by Senator Troeth of whether or not the committee can accommodate another inquiry given its current workload, I should advise the Senate that I approached the secretariat of the committee to ascertain its workload.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that there is capacity to conduct this inquiry in the time available. Over the next seven weeks the Senate will not be sitting. While there are a number of inquiries being conducted by Senate committees, nonetheless I think there is scope within the foreign affairs, defence and trade committee for this inquiry to be conducted. In any case, this is a matter that one would have to be blind and deaf not to know is notorious. One would have to be blind and deaf not to know the degree of anger and frustration that is felt around Australia by industry, by those involved with helping developing countries and by media commentators and respected former <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> diplomats, not to mention the foreign reaction that has been occasioned here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government has some proposals, an inquiry of this nature is the obvious opportunity for the government to indicate the nature of those proposals. The fact that it has not indicated the nature of those proposals to this point but fobs off the protests on the basis that `We've got the matter under study' is not an answer which inspires any confidence that that study will produce a result which anyone will be mollified by. Therefore, I believe this inquiry will be of major public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">May I say two other things. An amendment to the terms of reference has been moved by Senator Bourne. I have no difficulty in accepting those terms of reference. But, looking at them on close inspection&mdash;and bearing in mind as well the remarks made by Senator Margetts about the importance of foreign aid and her view, as she expressed it in this chamber a moment ago, about the non&hyphen;government organisations' view of the DIFF scheme&mdash;I think it is probably possible for those matters to be explored within the existing terms of reference. At the end of the day that will be a matter for the committee but I think it could be possible, under these terms, for those matters to be teased out further if that is the desire of the committee and of senators in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the motion and the proposed amendment to the Senate. I trust that the debate at least will have shifted government senators to the more reasonable view that, rather than resist the searchlight of a Senate committee of inquiry being imposed on this vexed area of public concern, the far better thing is to go along and conduct a full and frank inquiry as promptly and as quickly as we can so that all misconceptions and misunderstandings are removed, and hopefully a unanimous view can be taken about a valuable scheme such as this, how it is best run and the importance of retaining it.

<STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(11.12 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate has before it the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 1996, which seeks to make a range of changes to ATSIC. According to the summary provided by the second reading speech of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron), the most significant changes are a reduction in the size of regional councils, continuing the practice of the chairperson of ATSIC being appointed by the minister, improved accountability arrangements for regional councils and the provision to appoint an administrator to manage the operations of ATSIC under certain circumstances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Greens (WA) objected to this bill being exempted from the cut&hyphen;off motion because of the sweeping nature of the changes being proposed, changes which have certainly not been discussed in the community. We were told at the time that the bill is urgent because failure to deal with it now would create timetable problems for the forthcoming ATSIC elections. We reject that argument because the ATSIC elections will be substantially affected by the passage of some of the measures in this bill. Those changes should not be inflicted on the community just months before a triennial election round. They should be put off until after those elections.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The measures in this bill should be thoroughly discussed throughout the country. It is all very well for the minister to say that the changes have the support of the ATSIC board. But the ATSIC board does not necessarily encompass the totality of views of the indigenous community. The rest of the indigenous community has barely heard about these changes. In fact, the committee hearing of which I was a participatory member last Friday vividly illustrated that there is not <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2204"> anywhere near the support for these changes that the government would have us believe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, it became clearly apparent in the proceedings of that committee hearing that these policy changes had been made in the form of cabinet decisions which were then imposed. This is my interpretation entirely, I might add, and no doubt the minister would disagree with me. To my mind they seem to have been imposed by the cabinet on the minister and the minister was left in the very difficult position of having to justify those policy changes before he had even become totally familiar with his own portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> It is highly questionable to go ahead with that state of play in relation to policy changes, irrespective of what portfolio you are in. With Aboriginal and Islander issues, it is even more important. We have continually marginalised and disenfranchised the indigenous people of this country by making laws that do not take their views into consideration. We do not have Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander representation in this place. Therefore, we have no excuse for not having the most wide&hyphen;ranging consultation before policy changes of such magnitude are contemplated by this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many honourable senators are very familiar with the time needed to consult effectively with remote indigenous communities and the diversity of indigenous communities throughout this country. The minister is setting a worrying precedent early in this government's term of office if he can insist that such fundamental changes be made with little or no consultation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will now deal with our objections to some of the measures in this bill. The first is the continuation of the minister's role in choosing the chairperson of ATSIC. This was to have been a power which lapsed with the 1993 elections. It was continued then, as honourable senators would know, largely because of representations made to Senator Kernot. The Greens (WA) opposed the extension then and we most certainly oppose this further extension. We will be supporting an appropriate amendment to be put by the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> It is a sad indictment of the conduct of relations between government and the in digenous people in this country that ATSIC is not trusted to choose its own chairperson. I wonder whether the Liberal Party would put up with an outside group choosing its party president, or would the party accept the idea that the Governor-General should choose its parliamentary leader? This measure should be opposed by every honourable senator who upholds the policy of self-determination in whatever form that person might choose to define such a concept.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes to schedules relating to numbers of regional councillors may well be worthwhile, but we have no way of knowing whether that is the case. Certainly numerous submissions we have received from regional councils and regional councillors do not agree. Many argue that reducing the number of councillors will also reduce the effectiveness of the representation they are able to offer and reduce the effectiveness of regional council decision making.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must object to some of the usage that is being made of statistical tables which show how many people will be represented by the regional councils. There is a failure to take into consideration the geographical factors involved. For example, there might be what looks like a very favourable ratio of councillors to members of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population in certain areas, such as in the remote areas of Western Australia. However, they are largely mythological in their benefit because of the enormous amount of ground that has to be covered for those people to get together. In some cases, it is utterly impossible. As far as we are concerned, we cannot support those kinds of statistics and arguments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Proposed changes subsumed in the general rhetoric of accountability have also been coming from the government. In another context, we have seen the confusion, not to say chaos, which the government has managed to bring about in the indigenous community by its accountability measures. I have repeatedly said that bureaucratic accountability is not the problem; it is about accountability in the communities to the people in terms of service delivery. Adding layer upon layer of bureaucratic accountability measures does <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2205"> not necessarily increase the overall accountability and effectiveness of service delivery to Aboriginal communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose that we should not be surprised if we find draconian measures under the accountability banner heading. Accountability has come to mean only one thing in the lexicon of government: it means axing programs and appointments whenever a breach of some funding schedule is hinted at.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="KERNOT" NAMEID="XW4">

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SN5">Senator CHAMARETTE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Except for some areas, I might add. I acknowledge Senator Kernot's interjection. Some people have more favourable access to absolution than others. In my lexicon, accountability means providing a proper service to those whose lives are affected by the funding. It means that people who receive the benefit of the program have a say in how it is run and have a say in evaluating whether it is effective.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly there needs to be the proper acquittal of funds. But we have gone berserk in almost every area of government in recent years. Community organisations cannot get  their work done because they are too busy being accountable to their funding masters. I hear this complaint often from all sorts of sectors of the community where government funding is involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suggest that providing more funding for training for Aboriginal people so that they can understand the kind of bureaucratic hoops they are required to go through when they receive a grant may be far more effective than diminishing the amount of funding in order to provide yet another layer of bureaucratic accountability. I refer here to the $700,000 that it is going to cost to have a super auditor put in place. It is not under the measures in this bill, but it has been made at the same time as the policy changes in this bill were mooted. That $700,000 for the so&hyphen;called super auditor is being taken away from the ATSIC budget. It will result in a lack of funding to the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is easy for those in government to gain community support for this skewed idea of accountability. They have only to hint at <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> money not being accounted for and there is an inevitable outcry in the community or the media. Government has only to chant that well-worn mantra&mdash;the previous government did it too&mdash;`the taxpayers are not prepared to put up with this' and all heads appear to nod in approval.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems that the subgroup of the population known as taxpayers changes according to the program and the speaker. I personally find it extremely offensive when that term is used with the implication that a taxpayer cannot possibly relate to an Aboriginal person. We have to be very sure when we bandy that phrase about that we are not actually being quite offensive in what we are saying. We are implying that some citizens in this country have rights while others have privileges. I believe that we all have responsibilities in this regard. There are people within our community who seem to take for granted the benefits of having employment and the privilege of paying tax. We should be grateful that we are able to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Greens have long suggested that a review of the taxation system is needed so that it guarantees more equity and allows the population to be much more balanced in their access to resources than they are at the moment. Australia used to be noted for being a very egalitarian nation. I believe we are now approaching the same kind of balance that is common in developing countries where the decreasing number of rich are getting richer and the increasing number of poor and middle earners are becoming increasingly impoverished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen over the past few weeks the lengths to which the government will go in order to satisfy the craving for so-called accountability. How else can we explain the powers which exist in the Health Insurance Commission Act or some of the draconian powers available to the Department of Social Security to stop people's payments?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other significant change contained in the bill is the government's proposal to give the minister the power to appoint an administrator to manage the operations of ATSIC under certain circumstances. This is not an administrator to assist the commission or an <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2206"> external auditor to assess the commission's functions; it is an administrator to take over the whole operation. The nearest equivalent in the business sector is a receiver manager. As the chairperson of ATSIC pointed out during last Friday's hearing, ATSIC is neither near bankruptcy nor near death so a receiver manager is not needed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The appointment of an administrator means that the commission would not meet, that the commissioners would not be paid whether or not they are in any way involved in the matters which led to the appointment of the administrator, that any delegated powers of the commission may be revoked thus possibly leading to downstream functions being stopped and so on. This smacks of the most blatant paternalism imaginable. Where else would we find such a power? Would the government think of providing such a power to the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) in relation to the Health Insurance Commission? I think not. Therefore, it is certainly not okay to put such powers in the ATSIC Act, because you can easily sell the idea in the community under the accountability mantra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must acknowledge that the minister has said that he does not envisage these powers being used. But I think the whole principle of inserting them in the act is coercive, threatening and an insult to the organisation. Therefore, we do not support it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to these proposed changes, I received a communication, among many others, from New South Wales ATSIC Commissioner, Steve Gordon, in his capacity as chair of a meeting of the New South Wales zone commissioners and regional councillors. He said, amongst other things:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We see the proposal for the appointment of an administrator overriding democratically elected representatives as retrograde.</PARA>
<PARA>He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ATSIC is not opposed to reform, but reform should be robust&mdash;the middle way between draconian and feeble&hyphen;minded. We seek to save the government from errors that it could avoid.</PARA>
<PARA>We maintain that those errors could best be avoided by further consultation.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not support the measures that are introduced by this bill. The Greens (WA) cannot support this bill is its present form. We will be putting various amendments to the Senate in the committee stage and supporting other amendments from the opposition in order to improve the bill. We will consider whether the bill is supportable at the end of the debate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Our historical relationship with indigenous people in this country has been very complex. Since settlement we have seen many different ways that governments have attempted to deal with the historical fact that Europeans took the land from the original indigenous inhabitants. Policy responses have ranged from forced resettlement and stealing generations of children from their families to assimilation, the recognition of native title and the establishment of a land fund.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In structural terms, we have seen many models as well. In 1989 we replaced the National Aboriginal Conference with another model&mdash;ATSIC. I thought at the time, despite the lengthy debate, that it did show that we recognised that we needed to move forward in our pursuit of self-determination for indigenous people. As a result of the ATSIC bill, we continuing to debate that process today. Our government proposes four changes to that process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have democratic elections for regional councils across the country. We have the election of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander commissioners and we have a proportion of policies and programs that affect indigenous people being administered by this commission. That goes some way to alleviate the significant problems that have been caused historically in this country by the abrogation of responsibility, particularly at the state and local government levels, and to provide citizenship rights in the form of services to both indigenous and non-indigenous Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2207"> The establishment of ATSIC meant that indigenous people would have a significant say in decisions for funding projects for indigenous communities. However, the intro duction of some of these amendments at this time threatens the fragile steps that we have been taking towards reconciliation. Some of the key amendments are unwise. They work against the objectives of the act, as was pointed out by Social Justice Commissioner Mick Dodson.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to ask why we are doing this, why we are debating these amendments and why the government has chosen to introduce them. In the Senate committee hearing last Friday a couple of things were given as rationale. In the minister's submission we see the words `community demands for strengthened accountability provisions'. There was reference to the statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) of `mounting community concern' and there is a reference by the chair of ATSIC in an article she wrote in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> of 15 June to the words `an apparent haemorrhaging of public funds'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the committee hearing last Friday we asked where the evidence is of this haemorrhaging of public funds, community demands and mounting community concern. We also asked how this is measured.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister told us five things. He said there is a perception of this in the community. I think he is right. Then he said there was the federal election and the publicity surrounding certain comments made by various candidates at that time. Then he said that after that there were the election results. When pressed, the minister said that they quantified this mounting community concern by the media reports at the time in taking account of the way in which they attributed the success of some candidates to this perception. The last example he cited was that there are many complaints from Aboriginal communities on his desk. Those regarded as significant have been passed on to the Office of Evaluation and Audit for investigation. I think the pertinent fact is that those investigations have not yet concluded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We see, when looking for the rationale surrounding why it is appropriate to introduce these amendments at this time, that within two weeks of taking office, without quantified evidence&mdash;acting on perception, acting on election results which saw a disendorsed <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Liberal candidate go to the election with the description `Liberal' on the ballot paper and win the seat of Oxley from the Labor Party and acting on media analysis of that win and other results such as in Kennedy and Kalgoorlie&mdash;and without consultation with the chair and board of ATSIC, the minister emerged from cabinet with significant amendments to the ATSIC Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is despite the coalition's election policy, which was that there would be a commitment to retain ATSIC and to seek the views of indigenous people on how they would like to see it evolve. I do not think that happened before we moved down this track. The policy also included a commitment not to seek to redesign the system yet again, because the coalition had identified that as one of the repeated failings of indigenous affairs policy in Australia. I agree with them on that. They are not seeking to redesign the system, but they are seeking to make some pretty substantial changes to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is all based on the premise that ATSIC has been found to lack accountability. It was interesting and instructive to read what the chair of ATSIC, Lois O'Donoghue, said about the notion of accountability in an article `Who's accountable to whom?' in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> of 15 June 1996. She is reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I cannot take exception to the Government's concern for accountability&mdash;how could I? How could anyone?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, I can take exception to the assumptions that seem to underlie the Government's actions. I can wonder whether or not they are knowingly drawing strength and support from prejudiced and ignorant opinions and ask why indigenous Australians need to be more accountable than anyone else, for comparatively small amounts of money.</PARA>
<PARA>She lists three examples of media treatment of so-called ATSIC rorts. She makes this valid point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These organisations have either had their funding withdrawn by ATSIC over the past two or three financial years or, if they are delivering a crucial service, grant controllers have been put in to manage the funds they receive. The media have been highlighting the working of ATSIC's internal accountability measures. The commission's audit reports have been used to attack its own accountability.   <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2208"> </PARA>
<PARA>I think that is what has happened. It is wrong to say that the highlighting of this means that ATSIC has been proven to be unaccountable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have gone back and looked at the debate that surrounded the establishment of ATSIC. We have seen the preoccupation, and rightly so in some respects, with what forms of accountability we are building into the creation of another statutory body. The commission has within its own structure an Office of Evaluation and Audit. The director is appointed by the minister and that person reports directly to the minister and the board. The government has decided to appoint a special auditor. Obviously, it thought that what was there was not working sufficiently well. It knew all of this within two weeks of taking office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this article, Ms O'Donoghue gives an illuminating example of the selectivity embodied in the attitude of many in this place and in the wider community to the issue of accountability. She uses the example of the diesel fuel rebate scheme, which, at $1.2 billion last year, costs taxpayers more than ATSIC. She draws attention to the fact that there was a damning Australian National Audit Office report on the administration of this scheme. It suggests that the rorting of this scheme amounts to at least $32 million, and possibly much more, a year. Is that a haemorrhaging of public funds? Where is the outrage? Where are all the people out there saying, `This is a disgraceful lack of accountability.'?</PARA>

All I say about that is that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that is a comparison well made, and it is about accountability.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Based on a chronology of events, I suspect that Senator Herron went to cabinet with some amendments arising out of an independent review of regional council electoral systems and ATSIC's own operational experience review. That is a normal thing that would happen&mdash;taking some amendments arising from that to cabinet for discussion.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XW4">Senator KERNOT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;How do you think we know anything about the way government works, Senator Herron? You do not have to be in government to know&mdash;and you who have been there a few months are not showing that you know very much in that time either. I believe you came out of cabinet with extra things: with instructions to issue a general direction to appoint a special auditor&mdash;and you had to get legal advice on the drafting of that overnight&mdash;and, secondly, a proposal for reserve power to appoint a special administrator.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While we are focusing on the issue of accountability, I do think we need to look at the consequences of these two particular actions because, as a result of the appointment of a special auditor to vet every single one of the 2,000 organisations and 6,000 grants funded by ATSIC, we are told that most ATSIC regional offices have frozen much of the funding available to communities and that we are now facing the likelihood that 30,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who currently work for the dole will be forced to apply for normal unemployment benefits. Of course the obvious question is: at what cost? And at what cost to ATSIC is the appointment of the special auditor?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Herron told the committee on Friday that the cost was $750,000. As Senator Chamarette and others have said, it is coming from ATSIC's budget. That is the point. Just imagine what use that $750,000 could be put to in service delivery at the local level. No-one is saying that ATSIC is perfect. I think we all would realistically expect that audits will uncover some irregularities. Then the question is: are those irregularities based on inexperience or are they based on some form <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2209"> of deliberate fraud? Again, I ask: what has the cost of this exercise been?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Herron refers to perception. I think the costs of the last four months have been to confirm many prejudiced, stereotypical views about indigenous people&mdash;at the worst, that most blacks are crooks; using a slightly better construction&mdash;only very slightly better because it is quite paternalistic&mdash;that ATSIC has not been in existence for enough time for it to have had the experience in administration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Added to that, there is that ongoing ignorant perception that you cannot trust indigenous people with public moneys of any kind. It is a 1996 version of the mission manager. I think the last four months have done a great deal of damage to the process of reconciliation that most of us here think is important. It does not exist in a vacuum. It does not exist in isolation from the other decisions we are making in this place and the discussions we are having.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having made those general comments in the context of this bill, there are more than 40 technical and smaller amendments that we can support to facilitate the election process in October. But the Democrats will not be supporting the three key amendments&mdash;on the appointment of the chair of ATSIC, on the reduction in the number of regional councillors and on the reserve power to appoint an administrator&mdash;not just because they go to the heart of self-determination, but because, I believe, the government has failed to make a strong case, either in public when these were announced or, more particularly, at the Senate committee hearing on Friday, where not one witness&mdash;except the minister&mdash;spoke positively about any of the amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that there is room for a review in the matter of a reduction in the number of regional counsellors. I think it is a positive thing for us to suggest that we go away with the minister and with ATSIC and we look at finding a better way to balance the notion of efficiency in the workings of the regional councils with proper representativeness in terms of numbers&mdash;the ratio of councillors to constituents. I hope, when we get to the committee stage, we will be able to talk a little bit more about that.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me conclude by again referring to the article I mentioned, because I think it was an excellent article. I think it brought together some important threads about things which needed to be said on behalf of indigenous people. I do think that these amendments arise from stored up misconceptions about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, perceptions that are not true about accountability and perceptions which build on populist politics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think it is a satisfactory rationale to point to the election of a couple of people who were linked with racist remarks in the election campaign and who were either elected or re-elected, and to say, `There you go, there is the proof. There is mounting community concern over accountability.' I could never accept that as a quantified rationale for why we should move to undo some of the things that we have done in the name of self-determination of indigenous people in this parliament.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This bill is just one of numerous amendments that have been made to ATSIC since its inception in 1989. Some of the amendments contained in the bill are reflections on proposals put forward by the previous government, recommendations from the panel of review&mdash;which followed ATSIC elections during the last parliament&mdash;community feedback and the policies of the present government as expressed in the lead-up to the federal election this year. ATSIC, as we know, virtually replaced the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and is perhaps the chief administrator of indigenous affairs in this country&mdash;although state governments also play a significant role in that as do other Commonwealth agencies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2210"> This bill basically seeks to make changes in five main areas. The first change provides for the appointment of two commissioners and the selection of the chairman of ATSIC by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. The second provides for the reduction in the size of ATSIC regional councils. The third provides for improved accountability arrangements for regional councils&mdash;which includes access to docu ments, openness of meetings and the disclosure of pecuniary interests of regional councillors. The fourth provides for the appointment of an administrator to manage the operation of ATSIC in certain circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, there is a miscellaneous group of amendments which touch on such things as the eligibility to stand at regional council elections; technical amendments relating to electoral boundaries; the removal of regional councillors convicted of offences; the election of the deputy chairperson of the commission and, when required, an alternative deputy regional chairman; the appointment of acting commissioners; and a requirement that regional councillors who accept consultancies with the commission will have to stand down. That section extends to corporations which are controlled by regional councillors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that a good many of these amendments are non-contentious, and so they should be. On the face of it, these amendments go a long way towards improving the performance of ATSIC and improving the efficacy and accountability of the delivery of services to indigenous Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The more contentious parts of the bill have perhaps been the amendments which deal with the appointment of the chairman of ATSIC. In this regard, the bill returns to the 1993 position where the chairman was appointed, before the Keating government saw fit to amend that so the chairman was elected. At the time, we opposed that move by the Keating government, and we are showing consistency with that approach now that we are in government. ATSIC has a large budget&mdash;just under a billion dollars&mdash;and there is a very good reason for the government to have the ability to select the chairman of the commission. Some form of accountability is provided through that move.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The second amendment deals with the reduction in the size of regional councils. ATSIC, when it was first set up, had some 60 regional councils. That number was reduced in the life of the former parliament to 36 in an endeavour to improve the operation of ATSIC. This amendment, I believe, operates on the same theme. The number of councillors on the regional councils would be re duced, which not only saves on administrative costs but also enhances the level of performance of those councils. Someone approaching this matter for the first time would think this is a step towards limiting democracy but, when one looks at the fact that a council with no more than 1,000 people is represented by some eight councillors, one can see that the ratio of representation is very good indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third amendment also provides for the improved accountability of regional councils, which I mentioned earlier. This relates to opening up meetings of regional councils to the public generally&mdash;and particularly to indigenous Australians&mdash;and providing access to documentation. This, I believe, speaks for itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The appointment of an administrator to ATSIC has been criticised by the opposition and by minor parties. I would put to them that you do need a fail-safe mechanism. ATSIC enjoys a position where it has a large degree of autonomy&mdash;autonomy in dealing with a budget, as I said earlier, which is just under a billion dollars per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen today the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) tabling reports dealing with the Aboriginal legal services. Those reports show some areas of gross negligence and misconduct in the delivery of services to indigenous Australia. This is something which should cut across the board of government expenditure generally. We have a duty to the taxpayer and to the community to make sure that Commonwealth services are delivered in an efficient and economic manner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth amendment would allow, in extreme circumstances, an administrator to be appointed to deal with ATSIC when there is gross misconduct or fraud. That does not mean to say that commissioners would be stood aside or sacked. I know Senator Bob Collins raised that during the committee hearing&mdash;he said that power was open to the minister. That, I would submit, is a draconian power which would not be as effective as the appointment of an administrator.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The administrator could be appointed while the commissioners were still in office, and the administrator could provide a review to the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2211"> government of the day. It would be like using a block axe if you just walked in and sacked commissioners willy-nilly. I would support the use of an auditor, whilst retaining the commissioners. That is a far more preferable approach than the one advocated by Senator Collins, when he said that the minister has the power to remove them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government made a decision early in its term to improve accountability in this area, and that is what it is doing. It is carrying out its election promises and its policy which it put to the people of Australia in February and March this year. It is a policy upon which this government was elected. Any fraud or misconduct in this area can be visited upon only indigenous Australia. Any loss of funding by way of maladministration can harm only indigenous Australia. Not only is it an abuse of taxpayers' money, but it is more importantly a detriment to the delivery of services to indigenous people, be they in the cities or in the more remote areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend these amendments to the Senate and to the people of Australia at large. I think they go towards improving accountability and efficacy in the delivery of services to the areas for which the expenditure was intended. I believe these amendments have widespread support. The attack on the minister has been entirely unfair. I compliment Senator Herron in the way that he has approached this with such urgency. It is now June, the government was elected in early March and we have already before the Senate legislation dealing with these matters. For that aspect and for the urgency and diligence the minister has applied to the matter he is to be commended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have read the dissenting report of the committee which looked at these matters. I can find no convincing argument in the dissenting report as to why these amendments are inappropriate. As I said, a good many of these amendments came about as a result of recommendations made to the previous government, and the only one which would be more innovative is perhaps the appointment of an administrator.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> As I have already said, I would prefer the appointment of an administrator to the willy&hyphen;nilly sacking of commissioners or their sus pension. I believe one commissioner has been suspended already. The appointment of an administrator would provide a system where the commission can still be kept in operation whilst a review is conducted. But, as the minister has said, that would take place in only the most exceptional circumstances&mdash;where there was gross misconduct or widespread fraud.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">ATSIC was the brainchild, in the full sense of the word, of Mr Gerry Hand when he was the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation returns the position of chair of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission to the position it was before.

This point has been made time and again&mdash;and I think it has been made time and again because it should be made time and again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that, if you are going to have a democratic system&mdash;it was certainly Minister Hand's objective to have a democratic system, a system that reflected the views of the people that this commission was meant to represent&mdash;surely the person at the top should be elected, if not directly then in a secondary way, by the people whom he or she is going to represent&mdash;in the same way as the Prime Minister is elected. The parliament is directly elected by the people, and that part of the parliament which belongs to the successful party then votes in its ministry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at the way things are done, you will see that it seems extraordinary that an outside body&mdash;in this case, the government&mdash;should appoint the chair.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point about money being expended on Torres Strait Islanders and on Aboriginals is no different from the point about money being expended on this parliament. What worries me, and this is one of the reasons I am now on my feet, is that there seems to be a mood afoot in the community that anybody who is paid as a legislator&mdash;and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders fit into this category&mdash;is somehow wrong in taking public money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a very bad trend that this parliament and the people who are in this parliament are criticised, taken to task, demeaned and ridiculed, if you like, for costing a particular sum of money&mdash;and it is a large sum of money; in fact, $600,000 to keep a politician. In that statement there is the implication that that is wrong. That is just not right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Parliament and the people who sit here do a magnificent service to the country. In the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2213"> same way, by and large the people on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission do tremendous work for their constituency. So it is a false argument to say that the running of this commission costs money; of course it does.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the time comes when too much money is spent, and that is the time when we ought to step in. But we should not step in, take over and change the culture of this commission as it now is simply because it is expensive in particular people's estimates. Government is a great business, the most important business there is, and the quality of government should not be lessened simply to save costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If too much expense is being given to it and it is a matter that can be corrected without changing the quality of government, fair enough. But, as I say, there is a real problem afoot now that the quality of government at every level&mdash;not only in terms of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders but in terms of government for this country and in the states&mdash;will suffer severely, because people think it is more important to save some dollars, even considerable amounts of dollars, rather than to get good government.</PARA></SPEECH>

We all abhor <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> what happened in those days and wish we could do something to redress it. However, that is very difficult. But, again, they were things that the community in those days accepted as being the norm, even though there were individuals who opposed it generally in the community, not only Aboriginal people but also others.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had a situation where Aboriginal people did not get the unemployment benefit, where they were not counted in the census, where they were not given a vote. All of those things are now behind us. Nobody, regardless of what party they may belong to or whether they are independent people in the political community, would want to go back to any of those things. We see them as having been wrong at the time. Now that they have been righted we should go on to other ways of making things even better for Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to concentrate on the question of the election or appointment of the chairperson. I do not believe that the Aboriginal people should have any less stringent test put on their accountability in terms of auditing and inspecting the way they do business. I believe they should have people in their midst trained to the highest possible level to ensure accountability to the community and to provide a good service to their own people. I recognise that originally the legislation introduced by the Labor government was to appoint the chairperson, but we have moved on from that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I certainly have had experience in talking with people and I have been at meetings with people from ATSIC who have expressed views and whom I think are highly competent. We now have Aboriginal people who have gone through university and who are displaying a capacity for negotiating on behalf of their people. I mention, for instance, Noel Pearson, who was one of the people who moved in Queensland, up in the Gulf on Cape York, to get an agreement between the cattle people who leased that land for cattle raising, the Aboriginal people and the conservationists. It did not require any arbitrated decision. They came to conclusions themselves where they could all accommodate what they thought was important. Noel Pearson is an <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2214"> Aboriginal person who was in that instance, among others, very important to that process. We have Mick Dodson, the commissioner, who does an excellent job. We have Pat O'Shane, who is a magistrate in New South Wales. We are not lacking in people in the Aboriginal community who can do that job and do it well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some people might talk about the lack of capacity of people in the Aboriginal community to understand the needs of Aboriginal people, to understand how the administration of ATSIC should be carried out so that they get the best benefit. Some people might say that they might not know how to make an assessment and vote for the best and most suitable person for chairman or chairwoman. However, if we look at our own process and progress in these matters I do not think anyone would have suggested, say, 80 or 90 years ago that everyone who voted in the general community in this country really understood the issues, economic and social. But more and more people are able to understand those things and vote in a careful and understanding way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we go back to the idea of appointing a chairperson&mdash;and I have no problem with stringent legislation that requires them to behave in a certain way, as every person with responsibilities in the community should&mdash;I think we turn our back on all of the other areas where we have progressed and made the Aboriginal community a better community, better able to look after its own interests and better able to make a contribution to the general community in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am surprised that the minister, Senator Herron, would support such a proposal because I am convinced that, though we may be somewhat critical of some of things that he might have done or has not done, he does care about the interests of the Aboriginal people and does want to see them prosper, does want to see them progress, does want to see them have a right to maintain their own culture and their own history while at the same time becoming more and more a part of this nation, making a contribution and getting some return for their effort, equal to that of other people in the community.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I thank all the speakers for their contributions to this debate&mdash;in particular, my colleague Senator Ellison and also Senator Chamarette, because she is in the winding down phrase of her contributions in the Senate and I want to acknowledge the very thoughtful contribution that she made. More particularly I would like to thank Senator Burns. I have a high regard for Senator Burns. His thoughtful contribution summed up many of the views that all of us around this chamber have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of the contributions were constructive in nature. We all represent different viewpoints. That is what parliaments are about and that is what peoples are about. The Aboriginal people are in the same condition. There are viewpoints within the Aboriginal communities which differ from those of their representative bodies. It is a great regret of mine that my good friend Neville Bonner is no longer in parliament. He was the first Aboriginal representative and a man of great authority. We do not have an Aboriginal representative who would be in that position to speak for the people. So it is left to us collectively to determine that position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill we are debating is essentially about making ATSIC work better. You may say that it is paternalistic but it is done with the best intent. It is done with the intent of tightening up its accountability and improving its capacity to provide services to the indigenous community. The bottom line is improvement in services to the communities themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposals have arisen for a number of reasons. Most amendments in the bill were proposed by the previous government and many result from the section 141 review of electoral systems which attracted considerable consultation through hearings in 20 locations around the country. That was an independent review of the regional council zone and Torres Straight Regional Authority electoral systems. It tabled its report in both houses of parliament in May last year, in fact in the Senate chamber on 30 May 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the review of electoral processes did not come from the current government; it was an <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2215"> independent review. People can be critical of the fact that further consultation could have occurred. Senator Chamarette referred to this. But the reality is that it was done with the best of intent and supported by the then opposition, who agreed that there should be a review. It is a matter of judgment as to how far the consultation could extend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">ATSIC's operational experience since the last major review of the act has highlighted the need for refinement of its operations. The policies that the government foreshadowed during the election and the decisions that the government has made since then will improve accountability and service delivery by organisations funded by ATSIC in light of concerns from both the indigenous and wider communities. I illustrated that earlier today by tabling the audit reports on legal services. They are but one example of the community concern which has now been proven to be valid. It is no good saying that there was no community concern prior to the last election. The audit reports which I tabled reveal, in stark contrast, what has occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is determined to ensure that money spent on indigenous programs is handled efficiently and makes a real difference to the people it is intended for. Unless these amendments are in place prior to October, the government's policy on the electoral provisions will not apply until the following ATSIC elections in three years time. This is an inordinate delay for the implementation of the policy of the government of the day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also a strong case for all procedures relating to the conduct of this year's elections to be in place as soon as possible so that the requisite educational campaign and administrative requirements can be put in place. There is a need to move quickly on these amendments due to the need for the amendments related to the elections in particular to be passed before the elections for regional councils are called in the second half of the year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reduction in the size of regional councils will improve efficiency and responsiveness. Costs will be reduced. These amendments reflect community concern, as found by the review panel following the last elections. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> I note that Senator Bob Collins is not diametrically opposed to the reduction and that there was wide consultation in the community. But Senator Collins has given no attention to the fact that regional councils have executive responsibilities and need to be of a size to work most efficiently in the interests of the communities. Size and reflection of the community is something that we can debate later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn now to the appointment of the chairperson and the two commissioners. The chairperson may be chosen from the 19 commissioners, including the 17 elected. The chairperson must have a national perspective and not be beholden to any community or state based constituency. The government needs to have confidence in the chairperson. ATSIC is a Commonwealth statutory authority, responsible to the government as well as its electors, and public funds are involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The chairperson is an ex officio member of a number of other statutory authorities&mdash;such as Aboriginal Hostels, the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, and the Indigenous Land Corporation&mdash;and is also chair of the section 141 review panel, the very panel that drew up the recommendations for regional councillors. That panel considers matters relating to boundaries and electoral systems. Because of that, an impartial chairperson is essential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No appointment will be made without consultation. It is absurd to suggest that the government would appoint a person totally unacceptable to the commission. In fact, when I appeared before the commission, I asked the board of commissioners to draw up the criteria it required of the chairman. I was criticised&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, last Friday. He considered them absurd. I understand that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2216"> Senator Collins accepts the criteria. I think there might have been a little misunderstanding because my speech was prepared by ATSIC and I assumed that it had been passed by the board of commissioners when in fact it had not. But those criteria came from ATSIC, and I stand behind them, as Senator Collins does. I reject Mr Dodson's criticism.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The penalty provisions were introduced by the previous government. The opposition's proposed amendments are inconsistent with their previous stance. They have had a change of attitude. The government's amendments to the penalty provisions are consistent with similar provisions in other Commonwealth legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, section 4B(2) of the Commonwealth Crimes Act provides that a court may impose a pecuniary penalty on a person, even if the offence is expressed to allow for a term of imprisonment only. So the opportunity for the fine mechanism already exists. As Senator Burns said, there needs to be consistency between the treatment of Aboriginal and non&hyphen;Aboriginal people who break the law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ALP proposal about the removal of the requirement to consult the board before suspension of the commissioner, I point out, is supported by the board on the grounds that the decision is the responsibility of the minister. The board itself does not wish to have that responsibility, and I accept that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposal in relation to the review of representation of distinct community groups I reject. The inference is that representation of distinct community groups is necessarily in the interests of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community as a whole. Community groups and interests can be, and are, adequately represented through the present electoral process. It is fundamental to the operation of regional councils that councillors seek to represent the interests of the whole region, not particular communities or interest groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To pursue the argument that is being pursued by the opposition: why are there not women representing women's groups and men representing men's groups in relation to secret business of both sexes, for example? You can <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> pursue that argument ad infinitum. I do not accept that it is valid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the power to appoint an administrator, the amendments will allow for the appointment of an administrator to ATSIC or the TSRA in exceptional circumstances&mdash;where there is serious fraud, gross mismanagement or a failure to comply with ministerial direction&mdash;and would be time limited. There are parallels within existing provisions regarding regional councils being replaced by an administrator with an advisory committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You cannot say that the appointment of an administrator is such a terrible act when ATSIC itself can appoint administrators to its regional councils. Under these amendments, some or all of the board members could continue to act as an advisory committee to the administrator because they are suspended, not sacked. The government is committed to this course in order to safeguard the proper operation of ATSIC and the allocation of money to programs and services for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, the government is committed to ensuring full accountability for the expenditure of government resources. These amendments will improve the government's ability to ensure ATSIC's full financial and managerial accountability to the parliament. Most importantly, it will improve ATSIC's accountability to its own constituents by ensuring that resources get to the indigenous communities where they are most needed. I believe that all of us around this chamber have that bottom line: improvement for the indigenous communities where it is most needed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The board support for no consultation prior to removal of commissioners shows that there is acknowledgment that questions like these are legitimate matters for the government alone. Further, it is accepted that one commissioner or more can be removed. This amendment simply provides for the entire board to be replaced for a set period of time. So there is little difference in that regard, except that it is collective rather than individual.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not accept any suggestion that the amendments are discriminatory or contravene any international obligation in relation to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2217"> human rights. That matter was brought up and I would point out to the commissioner who brought it up that, yes, he does have a statutory authority, in fact an obligation, to look at legislation as to whether it is discriminatory or infringes human rights, but he does not have&mdash;nor do I have&mdash;a statutory requirement to discuss any proposals or any legislation that is about to be brought up before it is brought into the chamber. It is a misunderstanding, I accept, on his part. There is not a statutory requirement for consultation when legislation is being prepared; there is a statutory requirement after it has been prepared.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not a statutory requirement, as I have said, to consult when the material is being brought up. In regard to consultation on the amendments, protection against fraud and gross mismanagement is an absolute requirement for this government. There is no room for manoeuvring on these matters of principle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the use of administrators' powers in exceptional circumstances, with regard to the dissenting report's allegation that the government's case is not convincing that the power to appoint an administrator would only be used in an exceptional circumstance, it is my intention as minister that it would be used only in a case of fraud or gross mismanagement, or failure to comply with a minister's direction. That is quite explicit. What is more, that is what the bill says very explicitly so that the minister can only&mdash;I underline `only'&mdash;appoint an administrator under these very serious circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is noteworthy that the act already provides for ATSIC to appoint an administrator to a regional council, as I have mentioned. That is not dissimilar but probably involves less exceptional circumstances than those outlined for the appointment of an administrator to ATSIC. ATSIC has needed to use this power at least once.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government does not accept that the eligibility and termination provisions of the act should be watered down. These aspects were part of the original legislation and there is no case for a change. The provisions are <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> designed to ensure that appropriate people are elected to the responsible positions of commissioner and regional councillor. This not only aids accountability but also protects the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities which rely on ATSIC for the provision of services and programs.

<PARA>These amendments relate to the concern which is certainly shared on the whole of this side of the chamber about the appointment of the administrator. If I could refer to Senator Herron's comment first, he said, in respect of these particular provisions for the appointment of an administrator&mdash;I think I am quoting him correctly&mdash;`You can say that it is paternalistic, but it is done with the best intent.' As a student of history&mdash;and indeed, I am&mdash;I accept that statement from you, Minister. The sad history over the years is that, in respect of so many measures, which I guess make us all cringe now, in hindsight, we see the enormous damage that was caused to Aboriginal people, damage that is still being realised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You do not have to go too far past the personal tragedies of people like Rob Riley and others&mdash;so many like Rob Riley&mdash;who were scarred permanently by the experience of being forcibly removed from their parents. I am sure Senator Herron would know that in my own circle of close friends and acquaintances I number many men and women, a lot of them now in their 50s and 60s, who quite openly acknowledge the bitterness and the scars that that experience caused them. It often happened that a police officer would simply turn up out of the blue one day and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2218"> remove the child from its parents, usually from a highly distressed mother, and that is something that they will take with them to their grave. Of course, it was all done with the best of intent. It was all done in the pursuit of assimilation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While we are talking about assimilation, the other day when Senator Herron was being asked a question, I think a quite reasonable question, about whether any inferences could or should be drawn from his launching of a recent book which advocated such a move, he said that he was happy to launch any book that promoted public debate and that the book simply contrasted the views of Hasluck with the views of Coombs. I have actually had the opportunity now to scan the whole book and thoroughly read half of it. I would be very keen to do a review of it myself. I am sure a number of people will.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have picked up at least three errors where the author has in fact grievously misquoted people in support of his arguments. But, with respect to Senator Herron, I want to point out that the book simply does not do that at all. The book is an unblushing advocate for a return to such a policy. It does not simply contrast&mdash;interestingly, I might say, as I think the book is interesting&mdash;Coombs and Hasluck. In my view, in a very strong and fundamentally flawed way on some occasions, it uses the most trite material to support its case. The most trite anecdotal comments allegedly made by various people are used to strongly advocate a return to that position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If Senator Herron would like to know whether I would launch such a book, as much as I am an advocate of such debate, I would have said, `Certainly, but only on the basis that I will bucket the absolute daylights out of it at the launch, which I don't think would suit your purposes at all.' So, in terms of concerns about paternalism and so many of these policies with good intent, all of which were directed to those assimilationist policies, I actually think that those fears are well founded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by turning to a comment that Senator Ellison made which I think it worthy to canvass in this debate. Senator Ellison said that we have this legislation in front of us in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> response to a lot of community feedback. I have to say the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record stands as to what the minister told us. I said, by way of interjection, that in my view the exchange that occurred between Senator Kernot and Senator Herron last Friday and the comments that Senator Herron made were the most appalling statements that I heard over the whole day, and I have to say the comments are even worse when you see them in cold print.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regarding Senator Ellison's comments that this bill is also due to the policy of the government as enunciated during the campaign, let me remind Senator Ellison and the minister what that policy was that was enunciated. As honourable senators here might know, I was familiar with it because I campaigned largely, domestically, in the Northern Territory in the bush, in Aboriginal electorates. I came across my opposite numbers out there, I might add, and&mdash;and I will say to Senator Herron that I have done this for 20 years&mdash;when I come across my opposite numbers on election campaigns they are treated by me with the greatest civility, respect and courtesy. I am getting too old: I cannot be bothered with the non&hyphen;stop abuse that some people engage in, despite Senator Herron's assertions that I am an appallingly abusive person and a big bully and all the rest of it.</PARA>

But let me say this: I am therefore familiar with what was being told to Aboriginal people in my electorate, Senator Herron, by your representatives, who, I might add, were successfully elected to parliament on this basis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to make this point. In the past there have been lots of fears in Aboriginal communities about the attitudes of conservative governments towards their interests, both here and in the Northern Territory. I can tell you, Minister, that your representatives in the Northern Territory gave nothing but reassurance to Aboriginal people about ATSIC. It was specifically mentioned on a number of occasions&mdash;ATSIC, land rights and the whole lot. The general tenor of it all was, `We will support all of the programs that are <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2219"> now in place; none of them are in any danger. We will not be eroding any of the Aboriginal structures. If the Labor Party suggests we will do that, that is all nonsense. In fact'&mdash;as one candidate said&mdash;`that is lies; the Labor Party is lying to you. Here is our policy; it is in print.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And what was it? I will read it out to you. The executive summary from the Aboriginal affairs policy which was widely circulated in my electorate during the campaign says this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will retain ATSIC and we will seek the views of Aboriginal people on how they would like to see it evolve.</PARA>
<PARA>Part 5.1 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In government the coalition will seek the views of Aboriginal people on how they would like to see it evolve.</PARA>
<PARA>The assurances were given that there would be no changes made to ATSIC&mdash;`We are not going to tear it apart like Medicare'. Let me tell you, Senator Herron, that is what you said you would do. During the campaign we said, `These people cannot be trusted; they are telling lies. Don't believe honest John.'</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I shook hands with him and he said, `How's it all going?'

Conservative candidates campaigned and were elected in the Northern Territory on the basis of assurances they gave Aboriginal people that nothing would be done to the status quo regarding ATSIC until Aboriginal people had been consulted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of some of the most offensive sections of this bill, not only was there no consultation with Aboriginal people on the ground, as your representatives promised them, Minister, but not even the slightest courtesy was extended to the ATSIC board in even discussing major changes&mdash;changes that are now causing enormous grief on the ground right now, as I speak, in Aboriginal Australia&mdash;and not even the barest courtesy was extended to its chair; a courtesy that had to be interrupted while you left that meeting to be called away to the Prime Minister's press conference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So government senators should not come in here advocating support for this legislation on the basis of their track record for absolutely breaching commitments they gave to the Aboriginal electorate in Australia during the election campaign. Let me tell you, Senator Herron&mdash;and I say this with some regret&mdash;I know a number of Aboriginal people who actually believed those promises. Aboriginal people that I have known for over 20 years were saying in my electorate, `Bob, this mob are not saying the hard things that they used to say. They say they will help us. They say they will support land rights. They say they will not touch ATSIC and they will not do these things. So maybe we can trust them this time.'  </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those people were deceived. Those promises were broken&mdash;and the evidence of that is going through this parliament right now.

In fact, precisely the opposite view was put. The commitments that were given in the process of this very first section of the bill are now being broken, or at least an attempt is being made here to break them. Hopefully, honourable senators here will ensure that, on this occasion and with this particular measure, those promises will not be broken.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you&mdash;and I will talk about the issue of whether the commission needs an administrator or not. I note in the explanatory memorandum that the reserve power to appoint a commission administrator would be if the minister is satisfied that the administration by the commission of the commission's funding involved fraud or gross mismanagement; the commission intentionally failed to comply with a general direction; and the commission failed to take reasonable steps to prevent a contravention of direction in force under section 12 of the act. When we were asking whether this was necessary, in his evidence, Senator Herron said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would expect that the appointment of an administrator would be resorted to only in extreme circum <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> stances where there is a pressing need to fix a serious problem. In this way the government would have the capacity to act quickly against fraud, gross mismanagement or failure to comply with my directions under the act.</PARA>
<PARA>There is an assumption there that the whole board of commissioners is either so totally incompetent that we would find fraud or gross mismanagement; that they are corrupt and we would see fraud and gross mismanagement; or that they have conspired to deliberately defy a general direction from the minister, or other matters. I personally cannot see that happening. I cannot see the entire board of ATSIC being incompetent and/or corrupt and I cannot see them wilfully defying directions from a minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another remedy to some of your concerns. That remedy was identified by the chair of ATSIC in her evidence when she pointed out that she does not know of one instance where ATSIC has not acted against an organisation which has breached its conditions. That includes 2,000 organisations and 6,000 grants to organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that committee hearing and elsewhere, we found that it has been other authorities who have not seen fit to take the matter any further. The chair spoke about the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Securities Commission and many others. We know that in many instances these organisations have said, `This isn't a high priority for us' or, `Sorry, we don't have the resources to pursue it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I would suggest that the remedy is for this government to ask these agencies, authorities and statutory bodies, `Why aren't you willing to take these complaints to the end of the investigation and make recommendations?' Because ATSIC is left with the public perception that they are not interested in accountability or doing anything about their own internal processes. Rather than appoint an administrator, Minister, this government should be more serious about assisting ATSIC in pursuing the processes that are already in place.</PARA></SPEECH>

<STATE> (New South Wales)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(12.46 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My remarks today are not aimed at some political advantage, although I am speaking about the former Prime Minister Mr Keating. Mr Keating has left the political scene but I do not know whether he has exercised an option to return to his formerly half&hyphen;owned piggery. So there are no political points to be scored from what I am saying. But I am seeking to set the record straight. After years of abuse of me, I am determined that there should be no question about the accuracy of my revelations over the years about Mr Keating's relationship with his piggery.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My purpose is to ensure that there be no rewriting of history to show Mr Keating as some kind of hero of the workers whose behaviour was at all times above any kind of suspicion or proper inquiry. The facts are that it is not customary for treasurers or prime ministers of Australia to enrich themselves in office. One of the purposes of the disclosure requirements for politicians is to enable the Australian public to be fully informed about any such enrichment that takes place and to ensure that it does not represent any abuse of office for personal advantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There can be no argument that as Mr Keating prepares to move into his $2.2 million Sydney residence he is far richer than <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> he was as a junior union official before entering parliament and that there were considerable earnings other than from parliamentary or ministerial salary during his time in office. The large profit, for example, on the sale of his piggery interest, while the Commonwealth Bank lost millions of dollars of its money, was revealed only in court documents. That provides a case in point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My concerns in raising questions about Mr Keating's otherwise secretive full involvement, initially while Treasurer, in his half&hyphen;owned piggery group and in its joint venture with a Danish multinational pork group, Danpork, which was signed while Mr Keating was Prime Minister, were proper concerns of any senator determined to ensure that there be no taint of impropriety over the Australian parliament or government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet I faced a concerted campaign of personal abuse, illegal obstructionism by way of failures by these companies to file annual returns, and the filing of false and inaccurate company returns with the Australian Securities Commission. Obviously, there are plenty of examples of that personal abuse. This chamber is well aware of them. I think `parliamentary filth' was one of the least charming that he applied to me. But I suppose that being called a guttersnipe by people of the status of Laurie Brereton is some kind of an accolade&mdash;and I accept it as such.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was not the only subject of abuse from the former Prime Minister or his staffers such as Mr Turnbull, or, should I say, Mr Pitbull. Reports are legion of journalists and editors who dared to publish anything about Mr Keating's piggery interests and his remarkable increasing wealth being subjected to incredible tirades of personal abuse. The editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Age</EMPHASIS> spoke of such a tirade a couple of years ago on radio. That tirade resulted in Mr Keating banning the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Age</EMPHASIS> from prime ministerial press conferences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A prominent female journalist was called a `fat&hyphen;arsed bitch' by Mr Keating and then became known as FAB. I might say that in my view she is fab, but short for fabulous. A Sydney <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun&hyphen;Herald</EMPHASIS> correspondent was threatened with a tax office inquiry&mdash;which he had the courage to report&mdash;for reporting on Mr <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2222"> Keating's activities. An ABC Newcastle part&hyphen;time radio journalist was sacked, following complaints about her totally accurate report of pollution at the Keating Parkville piggery. A distinguished <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> columnist was dropped after daring to ask a series of questions in his column about the Keating piggery.The editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> was abused for printing detailed reports of official Australian Securities Commission documents relating to the Keating piggery. So it goes on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is no wonder that the media in general felt too terrorised to report the great bulk of the factual information detailing the illegal and improper behaviour of Mr Keating's piggery group while he was its half&hyphen;owner and, of course, while Mr Keating kept on saying, `But I have no role in the management of this group.' No, the group was managed by his 50 per cent partner whom Mr Keating trusted so much that he had given him his power of attorney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One would think that any person who owns 50 per cent of a company that is involved in constant breaches of the law, in contemptuous disregard of the requirements of the Australian Securities Commission, would at least have some sense of responsibility&mdash;but not Mr Keating. When Mr Keating sold out of the piggery at a huge profit, with a repurchase option in the memorandum of understanding to the sale, the media ignored further evidence of impropriety on the basis of saying, `Well, now he is out of it'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say, however, that some journalists like Colleen Ryan of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> and Trevor Sykes of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>&mdash;neither of whom, I might add, are in the gallery&mdash;persisted and wrote detailed exposes that were outstanding examples of honest journalism that made some gallery journalists who had dismissed me, in the Labor words, as a `muckraker', look even sillier than usual.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate knows the accuracy of my revelations of illegality by the Keating piggery companies; successful prosecutions of his partner and his representative as a director or secretary for breaches of Corporations Law have all confirmed this. Details have been tabled in this parliament. The extraordinary <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> role of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia in financing this mess has still not been properly revealed. Today I gave notice of a motion relating to this problem, which the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) raised last year in the House of Representatives, when unfortunately the press gallery was, as usual, not very interested.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The comments by the honourable member for Mackellar relate to the way that the Commonwealth Bank successfully sought to hide the special relationship that existed between the Commonwealth Bank in lending to this piggery group and Mr Keating, who bought into the group while Treasurer and was the Prime Minister when the joint venture deal with the Danish international company Danpork was put into effect. The honourable member for Mackellar said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . if there had not been a class order granted back in 1993, there would have been a requirement on the bank to report on the relationship between Mr Keating and the Commonwealth Bank and the nature of the loans he had from that bank. I am further concerned about this matter because, on the last day before the last election in 1993, a document dated 6 August 1992 in the name of D.N. Maynard of the Commonwealth Bank, purporting to be a report to the credit committee of the board, was the subject of a legal action by the Commonwealth Bank to prevent this document being published by Channel 10. It was an interim injunction that was sought and was gained.</PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Class orders had been obtained which effectively exempted directors and auditors from reporting on related party disclosures.</PARA>
<PARA>They relate to the Commonwealth Bank. The honourable member continued:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1993, under the guidelines for financial statements of public authorities and commercial activities, which were issued by the Minister for Finance, it was said with regard to Accounting Standard AAS22 on related party transactions that `subject to Ministers not being taken to be related parties in relation to matters falling within their statutory responsibilities, they were to be exempted'. But in all other respects, ministers of the executive government were to be related parties for all public authorities and Commonwealth commercial entities. That is quite clearly meant to cover the Commonwealth Bank.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accounting Standard 1017 was amended. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2223"> </PARA>
<PARA>I mention in passing that the Treasurer was the minister responsible for the Commonwealth Bank at that time. At that time, the Treasurer was Mr Keating. The honourable member for Mackellar continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was amended in order to toughen it up so that we could have a stronger accounting system. Immediately that amendment was gazetted, there was a letter written by the Australian Bankers Association to the Australian Securities Commission, asking for an expedited and amended class order to be given in respect of reporting on related third-party transactions. The worrying thing was that the conclusion of the letter says this: `It is therefore submitted that there is an overwhelming case for the ASC to extend the scope of the Class Order in the terms sought. If you wish any further information or explanation in support of the application please call'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and a man is named&mdash;`of Commonwealth Bank of Australia'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and the phone number is given. It continues: `Because the financial year of Commonwealth Bank of Australia ends on June 30 1993, it is anxious to have the benefit of the ASC's ruling on the extended Class Order as soon as possible. Other member banks of the Australian Bankers' Association are similarly affected by the disclosure requirements but their financial years occur later in the calendar.' Quite clearly&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>as the honourable member says&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">this letter was written at the behest of the Commonwealth Bank with regard to expediting the granting of the extended class order because of their reporting period.</PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for Mackellar asked representatives from the Australian Securities Commission at a hearing of the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities whether they</PARA>
<PARA>realised that once that class order had been granted the relationship between the then Prime Minister, Mr Keating, and his piggery group of companies and the Commonwealth Bank did not need to be reported. They replied that they did not know that that would be the effect of the order.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member then asked whether it would have made a difference in their giving that order. They replied that they certainly would have been hesitant and given it far more consideration. The honourable member said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My specific concern relates to the effect that the class order had in preventing information as to Mr Keating's dealings with the Commonwealth Bank, bearing in mind the relationship between the government and the Commonwealth Bank, and particularly the Treasurer (Mr Willis) and the Commonwealth Bank, and the need to have transparency.</PARA>
<PARA>They are not my words but the words of the honourable member for Mackellar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The clear fact is that the guidelines of the Minister for Finance require ministers to be accountable when they act in other than their capacity as a minister. The honourable member for Mackellar said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not believe that Mr Keating's investment in the piggery group of companies had anything to do with his ministerial responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA>That is self-evident.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The big question is this: if there was nothing improper to hide, why has the Commonwealth Bank gone to such extremes to prevent the normal release of information normally required by law? It took out an injunction&mdash;it clearly indicates the accuracy of the document&mdash;to prevent the publication of the report to the credit committee of the Commonwealth Bank revealing the provision for bad debt of $4.5 million against the Keating piggery group. That loan was made when Mr Keating was the Treasurer and when Mr Keating's partner in this matter was an owner, along with Mr Keating's former colleague Mr John Brown.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that Mr Keating subsequently received a substantial benefit while Prime Minister as a result of the Commonwealth Bank's extraordinary financial support of his half&hyphen;owned piggery. It is a matter of concern that the report the Commonwealth Bank prevented from being shown on television notes that the loan given was because of the failure to investigate adequately the financial position of the operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is about time that this cover&hyphen;up of an incredible loan involving enormous losses at a time when Mr Keating made a very substantial profit on the sale of this very expensive piggery, at least as far as the Commonwealth Bank is concerned, was revealed. It is about time that the cover&hyphen;ups were brought to an end. It is about time that the gallery, for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2224"> example, stopped being terrorised by the former Prime Minister. He is not around any more to bark at them and threaten them with non&hyphen;admission to press conferences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The facts are that Mr Keating has benefited from a whole lot of activities, particularly the fact, which cannot be denied, that the company's accounts were false and Mr Keating made a mint by selling out to an Indonesian group. How curious that his new venture in private life involves business interests in Indonesia!</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<STATE> (New South Wales)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(1.00 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A couple of years ago, I was talking to a friend and we were discussing a visit that we had made to the United States, particularly to New York. This friend said to me, `The question about New York is: how do they get rid of all the garbage in that teeming metropolis?' Now that Senator Baume is off to New York, I think they are going to have an even bigger problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today, I would like to make some further remarks in respect of a matter of the utmost public interest to the people of Sydney, particularly those in the Hughes electorate and the surrounding areas near Holsworthy. On Sunday, 2 June, a public meeting was held at Wattle Grove, a delightful new housing development in Holsworthy, the site of the impending second airport for Sydney if the coalition government has its way. Some 4,000 people attended that public rally, held on a wet day, to express their anger at the deception perpetrated by the coalition government with respect to this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At Wattle Grove there is a sign at the entrance to the area with a picture of John Newcombe, the former great Australian tennis player, with a caption that reads: `I'd like to live here'. We know that John Howard, the Prime Minister&mdash;the then Leader of the Opposition, prior to the election&mdash;and John Sharp, now the Minister for Transport, certainly were not saying to the people of Wattle Grove and Holsworthy that they would not like to live there, but they are saying it now. It is a pity that they did not come clean before the election on 2 March and tell the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people of Holsworthy, Wattle Grove, Moorebank, Chipping Norton, all those other suburbs in the electorate of Hughes and the state electorates in this area, of the plans that they had to put Holsworthy firmly back on the agenda as a potential site for Sydney's second airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we know, the issue of aircraft noise and the location of Sydney's second airport was a most important issue in the last election in a number of electorates in Sydney. It is an issue that many of us have spoken about before in this parliament, and no doubt we will do so in the future. It is an issue that, particularly in more recent years, has been at the forefront of public debate. In that context, one has to ask why the coalition kept secret from the people of Sydney, particularly the people of the electorate of Hughes, their proposal to relist Holsworthy as a site for a potential second Sydney airport, notwithstanding that it had been rejected firmly back in 1985, at the time of the environmental impact assessment and examination of Sydney's second airport's needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before the election, John Howard, the then Leader of the Opposition, was clearly on the record with respect to issues of aircraft noise and Sydney's second airport. He was campaigning strongly for the reopening of the east&hyphen;west runway. He was saying to everybody that Badgerys Creek was their proposed site for Sydney's second airport. At no stage was there ever any mention by John Howard, or indeed any other spokesperson from the opposition, that Holsworthy would even be considered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Acting Deputy President, having been a member of the Senate select committee at the time, you will recall that, when a proposal with respect to Holsworthy came to the committee from an action group on the North Shore, it was firmly rejected by the committee in its majority report. That committee was chaired by Senator Parer, the then shadow spokesperson on transport, also a person who had campaigned and spoken publicly time and time again about this issue but who at no stage ever divulged to the committee or the public the plans for putting Holsworthy back <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2225"> on the agenda with respect, as I said, to a possible second Sydney airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that we now know that, whilst the Senate committee was inquiring into this issue and taking evidence from hundreds of people and organisations from around Sydney and receiving in excess of 4,000 or 5,000 submissions, Senator Parer was sitting there, knowing that they had been approached in the previous year about a proposed development for an airport at Holsworthy. That has been confirmed by the transport minister, Mr Sharp, who, on 28 May in answer to a question in the House by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, acknowledged that they had received a proposal for a development which effectively involved a swap for land at Badgerys Creek acquired by the government. In return, they would be involved in the development of an airport at Holsworthy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Sharp acknowledged in the House on that day in answer to this question that they had been asked to keep it secret, and so they had kept it secret. But we know that John Howard knew about this proposal&mdash;given to them well before the Senate committee's inquiry and before John Howard himself gave evidence to the committee that they supported an airport at Badgerys Creek, that that was their policy and that their policy was also to reopen the east&hyphen;west runway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, we all know that reopening the east&hyphen;west runway was part of the coalition's proposal to try and alleviate the problems for John Howard's own electors in the seat of Bennelong. He was certainly looking after the interests of his electors but, when it came to the electors of Hughes, he was silent&mdash;even though he knew that the proposal had been brought to him, as the then Leader of the Opposition, and to his shadow spokesperson on transport, Senator Parer. They kept it a secret.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> It is all coming out now that there was in fact a deal between the opposition at the time&mdash;now the government&mdash;and the proposal developers, to keep the proposal quiet. It disturbs me that the people of Hughes and surrounding areas have been deliberately misled and deceived. They have continued to be deceived by subsequent attempts by mem bers of the government to transfer the blame. Danna Vale, the now member for Hughes, attended the rally on 2 June. She indicated that she did not know anything about the proposal at the time and said that she was opposed to the airport, but she then got up at the public meeting and tried to lay the blame at the feet of the former member for Hughes, Robert Tickner. She stood up at that public meeting and quoted from a speech that you, Mr Acting Deputy President Childs, had given in the Senate on 30 May. You had said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I must comment on the member for Hughes, Mrs Danna Vale, who is a Liberal member of parliament. She says that, when she was a candidate, she did not know about the possible Holsworthy airport site. Robert Tickner certainly did. He spoke out.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>They were your words, Mr Acting Deputy President, and of course we know what you were referring to. You were referring to the fact that, at the time that the Senate committee received this submission about Holsworthy from the North Shore action group on 14 September, there was an immediate response by the member for Hughes, Robert Tickner, objecting to this proposal. He put out a press release dated 19 September 1995 and I seek leave to table this if I may.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="656">Senator FORSHAW</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The relevant part of that press release says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Federal member for Hughes Robert Tickner has condemned proposals by residents of Sydney's North Shore to have the second Sydney airport sited at Holsworthy.</PARA>
<PARA>Further on he refers to the fact that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the proposals for a major airport at Holsworthy have been put forward by the North Shore Aircraft Action Group in their submission to the Senate Select Committee on Aircraft Noise which met in Sydney last week.</PARA>
<PARA>That was the context in which that press release was issued. It was an immediate response to a proposal brought before the Senate committee at the time. And I remind the Senate that the committee was being chaired by Senator Parer who knew about this other proposal for Holsworthy that is now on the table, but who did not tell the committee about it.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2226">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But Danna Vale, the member for Hughes, stood up at that public meeting and said&mdash;and I paraphrase&mdash;`Don't blame me because I didn't know anything about it, but Robert Tickner knew about it.' It was a deliberate attempt to distort the facts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it gets worse. At that public meeting on 2 June at Wattle Grove, there were a number of members of parliament. I was there; Danna Vale was there, as the member for Hughes; Mark Latham was there, as the member for Werriwa; the now member, but then candidate, for Blaxland, Michael Hatton, was there; and a number of state members of parliament, including Craig Knowles, the member for Moorebank, and Ian McManus, the member for Bulli. There were no state Liberal members of parliament at that rally that I can recall, and certainly none were there that spoke.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is relevant because on 4 June in the New South Wales state parliament, the member for Bulli, Mr Ian McManus, moved an urgency motion to condemn the proposal to build an airport at Holsworthy. That has since, of course, been put back on the agenda by the minister for transport (Mr Sharp) who has authorised an EIS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that debate, Mr Chris Downy, who was Danna Vale's campaign director in the last election, made a speech. On 4 June, in his speech to the state parliament of New South Wales, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal member for Hughes has been very active and vocal on this issue. She has defended the people she represents; she has put them before her party and she should be congratulated for what she has done.</PARA>
<PARA>These are the words I want to emphasise:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That contrasts starkly with the approach of the former Federal member for Hughes. Last week Senator Childs actually indicated&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>There was then an objection by Mr Phillips who is the member for Miranda and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. His is another state seat which certainly has electors who would be affected by an airport here. He interjected and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He is a Labor Senator, isn't he?</PARA>
<PARA>Referring to yourself, Senator Childs. Mr Downey replied:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is right, a Labor Senator, a factional colleague of the former member for Hughes&mdash;that Robert Tickner certainly did know about Holsworthy and the proposal to put an airport there.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, we have, in the state parliament of New South Wales, Chris Downey the state member for Sutherland, who was Danna Vale's campaign director in the last election, picking up this spurious, deceitful, disgraceful allegation that Robert Tickner knew about this proposal for an airport at Holsworthy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have clearly demonstrated, what the then member for Hughes was doing was responding as soon as he knew, and as soon as the Senate knew through the committee process we were undertaking, of another proposal for an airport; he was responding that he was opposed to it. But what do we have now? We have this disgraceful attempt at that public rally by a member of this parliament, the member for Hughes (Mrs Vale), and by one of her close colleagues, Chris Downey, the state member for Sutherland, to try and shift the blame to the very member of parliament who was out there representing the electors and opposing any proposal of Holsworthy for an airport. Frankly, I could think of nothing worse than an attempt by members of parliament to deceive and mislead the electors of this area on such a major and important issue, as has been perpetrated by these people.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This will not be the last time that I speak in this chamber, but it is my final speech in the sense that we have a first speech at the beginning of a Senate term. This Senate has a proud recent history as an effective house of review. It has been a privilege for me to contribute to the development of a more democratic system of government, firstly as senior adviser to former leaders of the Australian Democrats, Senators Don Chipp and Janine Haines, and now&mdash;for six years&mdash;as a Democrat senator for Victoria.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The traditional view of the main function of a member of parliament is that of a legislator. Certainly, this task has been embraced by the Democrats as the major responsibility, in particular since 1981 when we obtained <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2227"> balance of power in the Senate. Unless the government has had the support of the major opposition party, the Democrats have usually determined the fate of legislation. This means that every clause of every bill has to be assessed on its merits, as defined by the policies and principles on which Democrat supporters cast their votes. This role has been acknowledged by the Australian community; and finally, in the recent somewhat silly debate on mandates, most people now accept that it is a nonsense that the government of the day should have absolute power to enact anything and everything as long as it was part of its election platform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Being a legislator is not enough. The Senate offers other opportunities to press for positive social change, and in ways not dictated by the government's legislative program which lands on our desk with total disregard of one's own agenda. I owned up to my agenda in my first speech&mdash;to push us closer to a society which is socially and economically just for all its members, regardless of colour, creed, gender, sexuality, disability or wealth; a society which is ecologically sustainable and which is accepting of our responsibility to reduce inequality globally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is based on the strong belief not only that inequality in people's life opportunities is morally wrong, but also that such inequality, injustice and intolerance ultimately leads to conflict, oppression and violence. This was reinforced by my childhood experiences in war&hyphen;torn Europe and the enormity of the Holocaust. I determined that I wanted to do all I could to ensure that such events did not occur again and that we would leave a safer and better world to our children and to their children. I am very glad that my wife, Julia, and our children, Rebecca, Linden, Christopher and Karen, and Karen's husband, Gary, are here today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The main barriers a person of ethnic background has to overcome have been identified as lack of English, incomplete education, lack of money and little information on electoral and constitutional matters. These were some of the barriers that I faced when, with Julia's support, I decided in 1972 that I wanted to pursue the parliamentary option to work for <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the reforms I saw as urgent. These were formidable barriers. But while I prefer the words `determined' and `single&hyphen;minded', most of my friends, colleagues and staff&mdash;and certainly my family&mdash;would be inclined to use the term `pig&hyphen;headed'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The inevitable result was that our children were short&hyphen;changed. I know now&mdash;and, in a way, I knew it even then&mdash;that I was depriving them and myself of the time, the friendship and the personal closeness they should have had and I would have loved. I thank them and can but hope that their presence here today indicates that they understand what drove me and perhaps even that they consider that the results, however modest, provide some compensation for the loss they have experienced. All would have been in vain but for the loyalty, wisdom and support I received from Julia. I would not be here without you, and my gratitude to you is deeply felt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">None of us can function without our staff. Having been on both sides of the fence, I can appreciate the pressures and frustrations of that job and am grateful for the assistance I received from John McLaren, Ken Archer, Stephen Merrylees, David Ferris, who is here today, Matthew Townsend, who is also here, and Di Droog. But the prize goes to Beverley Irving, who started on the day I became a senator, is still managing me, and will leave as I depart. Thank you, Bev, for your effective, efficient and loyal support; but, more than that, for your friendship and the tact and sensitivity you used so well to interpret a uniquely demanding personality to the outside world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also owe a debt of gratitude to many staffers in the offices of other senators, led by Jacqui Flitcroft, Geoff Dodd, Mary Ritson, Jene Fletcher, Shirley Simper, John Cherry, Cheryl Thurlow, Althea Smith, Stephen Swift and the ferocious Sandra&mdash;alias `Sam'&mdash;Hudson. At times like these, one looks for continuity. It is fortunate that John Beever and Fergus McPherson are able to be here today, providing the link with the Australia Party, with Fergus managing the 1972 campaign from Gordon Barton's office and John Beever in Victoria accompanying me on that first visit, in 1972, to the then Minister for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2228"> Customs to suggest that he tie his political future to the Australia Party. In 1977, this visit bore fruit, and Don Chipp became the craggy face of the new Australian Democrats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new party was as forward looking as it is today and did not deserve the image of the middle&hyphen;of&hyphen;the&hyphen;road party bestowed by some commentators too lazy to read policies or to analyse Senate decisions. The left&hyphen;of&hyphen;centre reform movement also failed to look beyond a leader with Liberal Party antecedents, and valuable years were lost while the ALP proved itself unable to manage the vision of a Whitlam and extinguished Chifley's light on the hill, yet managed to hang on to most of the true believers against what should have been their better, more strategic judgment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A similar trend is in evidence now as the intellectual left refuses to acknowledge what the Democrats are doing and instead proceeds to parrot claims that Cheryl Kernot is taking the party back to the centre of Australian politics, apparently because she has some media appeal and a commonsense presentation which belies her uncompromising sense of justice. The work I shared with Senator Kernot on the Mabo legislation was the high point of my legislative work. I also appreciate the fact that she was prepared, as I was, to advocate tough action on Bosnia at a time when this would have averted some of the worst tragedies which have eventuated since. When I advanced the concept of my sexuality anti&hyphen;discrimination bill she endorsed it and became one of its strongest supporters. Surely, these are the actions of someone prepared to put herself and her party at the cutting edge of reform. Yet, recently an academic, who should have known better, suggested that the Democrats lacked a rigorous analysis of what needed to the done to achieve a sustainable post&hyphen;industrial society, thus displaying his ignorance of the party's alternative budget proposals released in various forms since 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is measurable support for a strong, united party offering a substantive alternative to the coalition and to the ALP but this will not succeed at the ballot box unless the Democrats become part of the agenda&hyphen;setting process in the lower house. The party is now <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> well placed to gain House of Representative seats at the next election. I am confident that it will succeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Earlier I said that being a legislator is not enough. Perhaps the most important avenue to explore new directions is offered by the Senate committees and their staff. From an early foray through the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitution Affairs, which resulted in a tougher antimonopoly test for mergers and acquisitions, to the first independent inquiry by an individual senator on industry development and tariffs, to the prolonged cost of justice inquiry, to outworkers, to treaties, to what may yet turn out to be a highly significant report on indicators and benchmarks for national wellbeing, not to forget the unfinished business of the casino and sexuality enquiries which are bequeathed, amongst others, to Senator Cooney for his diligent attention, I count this avenue as a critically important part of my work in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senate committees are delivering the process and the content for the leadership a national parliament should provide but rarely does. Certainly the `vision thing' was sadly absent from the recent election campaigns of the two major parties. I have some further comments on my other Democrat colleagues, on other senators, and on the invaluable services of the clerks and Senate staff but these will have to wait until tomorrow's valedictory, in deference to the time I have available today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me just say today that I did not mind being called a communist by Senator Bill O'Chee, and a Marxist by that urbane sparring partner of mine, Senator Rod Kemp, consoling myself that one is defined by ones opponents as much as by ones friends as indeed was proved by Premier Kennett calling me a Nazi. The Senate offers many opportunities to pursue persistent campaigns on particular issues. For me, it was the antinuclear campaign culminating in being arrested at Nurrungar and, more recently, the exploitation of child labour, a campaign I will be able to pursue as chair of the Anti&hyphen;Slavery Society in Australia and to some extent also at the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2229"> International Centre for Conflict Resolution at Melbourne University.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I am leaving this parliament, I am deeply concerned that the blunt instrument of cutting costs across the board is damaging severely the national interest in many areas, and is in fact moving us further away from what Eva Cox in her Boyer lectures called the civil society. We need to hold our own in the global market place but the Howard Government is cutting industry and export boosting programs. We need to become the intelligent and innovative society but cuts are mooted to education and research. We need to fashion a just and sustainable society but the ombudsman's budget is reduced by a third. We need to conserve our natural environment for future generations but more forests will be woodchipped and the pollution of air and water allowed to proceed. This Senate has an immense task ahead of it and, in many ways, I regret that I will not be part of it.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would say to Senator Spindler that the sand is running through the hourglass for me, too, but one cannot presume that my last speech has been given until midnight next Sunday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I rise in the MPI debate because there is a pressing problem, a proposal by the government to start a youth homelessness pilot program. To be more specific, the government has proposed a task force which will report by the end of this month, and the government hopes to have the pilot program in operation by August. For that reason, I bring to the attention of the Senate some concerns which I have with this program, and I will provide copies of what I am about to say to the task force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government, when in opposition, was concerned about the problem of youth homelessness and it sought to come into power and treat the problem&mdash;which it had identified in common with the Labor government&mdash;in a different way and from a different perspective. I am taking a generous view of the government's motivation in all of this. It is true that both political parties want to see <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> young people growing up in happy and well&hyphen;adjusted families. I would not want to indicate anything different from that point of view. I do think, however, that the means by which the government is seeking to bring about a different point of view has potential threats within it which, firstly, are going to damage their program and, secondly, are going to be so much worse for young people. I recognise that the coalition's election policy document said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition recognises that there are circumstances in which young people have every reason to leave home. Equally, there are legitimate concerns expressed by some parents and community organisations that the existing system places too little emphasis on family reconciliation.</PARA>
<PARA>It is fair to say that the government was responding to fears expressed by some people in the community that the availability of the homeless youth allowance&mdash;which was made available by the previous government&mdash;was in some way providing a means by which young people could leave home, and that this was in some way not particularly justified by their circumstances. Although they are very circumspect in most of the statements that they make, you can see that fairly clearly. In March this year, the Prime Minister made a statement in a doorstop interview in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the one hand there are obvious cases where family life has completely ceased to exist and young people are deserving and in need of support because they are genuinely homeless.</PARA>
<PARA>That is fair enough&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And yet other groups in the community representing parents who felt that the system has worked against them have argued that there is not a sufficiently effective surveillance made under present arrangements of the entitlement of young people.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the first point with which I want to take issue. Prior to coming into parliament, I worked as a voluntary street contact worker with the Wayside Chapel in Kings Cross, dealing with homeless youth&mdash;or, as they are more commonly called, `street kids'. I have to say that my experience there, and that of everybody else that I had dealings with, was very different from that which is implied in the Prime Minister's statement and which has <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2230"> been said by some of the organisations that he was alluding to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a very difficult position to be dealing with children under the age of 16&mdash;and, more commonly, they were children between the ages of 10 and 14&mdash;who had come to Kings Cross because it was the place they knew. They were coming to the city for the bright lights. Mostly, they were coming from the country. Their lives were characterised, certainly by the time that we had anything to do with them, by drug addiction&mdash;generally heroin addiction&mdash;and by involvement with both male and female prostitution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One thing stood out which really astounded me&mdash;and this is the reason I want to make such an issue of this program&mdash;that is, in every case that I came across, these children would attempt every six months or sometimes every year to go home and try and patch things up with their families. It does not take much imagination to realise what sort of families they were going back to: ones typically characterised by alcoholism, beatings by their parents and discord between the parents, where they saw their mother's partner beat their mother&mdash;all the sorts of circumstances of genuinely and chronically broken homes. Nevertheless, these children&mdash;without any prompting from anybody&mdash;would go home on a regular basis and spend a week or two weeks somehow trying to patch things up with their parents. One of the saddest things to see is when these children return, as they did to Kings Cross, having failed in their attempts to find some sort of reconciliation with their parents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe that it is fair to suggest, and I do not believe that data will be forthcoming to suggest, that the availability of the homeless youth allowance is an incentive for people to leave home. I do not believe that any cases of abuse should be forced to go through a process of reconciliation with parents. I do not believe that there should be more stringent requirements brought to bear to stop people from having that form of income support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should also say that I have absolutely nothing against voluntary organisations. The task force which the Prime Minister has set <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> up and the policy which the government wishes to pursue depend very greatly on voluntary organisations. As I said before, I worked with the Wayside Chapel, which has established an excellent reputation for work in the Kings Cross area, in particular with homeless youth. I have also had extensive experience with the Oasis Centre, which was set up by the Salvation Army in Kings Cross or in Darlinghurst. In particular, I pay tribute to the work of my friend Marcello Scali, who has worked as a youth worker with the Wayside Chapel and is presently with the Oasis Centre. He is entirely dedicated to the welfare of other people for very little return to himself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am certainly not pointing the finger at these voluntary organisations, nor am I suggesting that their efforts are anything other than laudable. But, when you go to the specifics of the government's policy and what the task force has been asked to report upon, there are a number of things that lead me to a state of disquiet, and I think they should lead the Senate to a state of disquiet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to state clearly, and for the government to state clearly, that there should be no link between reconciliation and income support. If there is any necessity for income support&mdash;and I believe there is&mdash;it should not be predicated on the fact that these children undergo a reconciliation with their parents. It has to be a voluntary process. If they initiate it and they wish it, or if the parents initiate it and the children respond, then by all means. As I said in the beginning, I do not think anybody would want anything other than reconciliation between parents and children and a happy relationship thereafter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is absolutely important that there be no feeling of compulsion on the part of the children. If they feel, as I believe the task force criteria suggest, that there is a link between their continued income support and the fact that they undergo a reconciliation or mediation process, I think that would be absolutely disastrous. There has to be some sensitivity in this matter. The sensitivity has to be shown to the people who are suffering out of all of this. Overwhelmingly, the people who suffer are the children themselves.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2231">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to bear in mind that a decision by a young person to go home after reconciliation should not be seen as a one&hyphen;way door. It is quite naive to imagine that people might leave home, have some form of reconciliation and then return home, and that is the end of the matter. If people knew about the circumstances from which these children were fleeing, it would be immediately obvious that the problem could recur. The young person may go home for a while but it may become impossible for them to stay there. They will leave, go home and leave over a fairly long period, at least until they are able to make their way in the world themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, it is very important that this is not just seen as a closed loop: the children go through a process of reconciliation; the income support is terminated; they go home; and that is the end of the matter. The income support should always be there and both the parents and the children should be entitled to counselling support after the period of reconciliation. They should be entitled to continuing surveillance to make sure that the children are not at home under any form of duress. There should be every opportunity for them to step out of that situation if they feel it is in their best interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final area of my greatest concern has to be that I do not think voluntary organisations should bear the responsibility for the counselling process and I do not believe that they should be relied upon to provide to the department the recommendations which the government seeks to place upon them in terms of whether income support should continue. The opposition's policy document says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the pilot a young person who applies for a homeless payment will be initially assessed for eligibility by a departmental officer.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>That is well and good. If there is a prima facie case for eligibility, he or she will be given a six&hyphen;week temporary payment. That is fine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is where the changes occur. One of the conditions of the payment will be that the person will be required to report to a participating voluntary agency. One of the principal roles of the agency will be to provide counselling and, wherever possible, mediate a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reconciliation between the young person and his or her family or guardian. The agency will prepare a detailed report on the person's circumstances. The report will include an assessment of the possibility of reconciliation in the short and in the long term and a recommendation as to whether the person should continue to receive the payment after the six&hyphen;week transitional period. The final decision as to the entitlement will rest with the department, but it will be based primarily upon the report of the agency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that is too great a responsibility for voluntary agencies to bear. As I have said before, I have a great deal of respect for the work that voluntary agencies do; but I still think that, in the terms of the policy which was stated by the government in its election platform and in the terms of the task force guidelines, it is too great a responsibility. At the end of the day, it is only a department that is accountable. It is only public servants, through their responsible ministers, who are actually accountable for their actions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Voluntary agencies mean well, and voluntary agencies do a great deal for very little reward to themselves. But the fact remains that they cannot be accountable in the same way as a public servant is accountable or a minister is accountable to this Senate and to this parliament. Unless that link is very clear, there is a danger that these children will be placed into situations where pressure is upon them to go back to their parents, to go back to their family home, and the sorts of things that made them leave that family home will be visited upon them again. I think it is an unfair pressure. I think there ought to be a great deal of sensitivity in this matter. I really believe that relying upon these voluntary agencies to provide recommendations and that that be the guiding principle upon which a departmental officer makes a decision is too great an onus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said at the beginning, I do not think anybody believes that youth homelessness is anything other than a blight on our society. It is a sad reflection that we can be as wealthy as we are, we can point to economic growth from year to year to year and, at the same time, in this supposedly wealthy society, we <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2232"> can find children, as I have seen, living a homeless life in places like Kings Cross. I might also say that the problem is getting worse, not better. In fact, it is now the case that Kings Cross is no longer the major focus for this problem. In Cabramatta the problem is even greater&mdash;greater because there are now greater numbers of children out there and greater because the sort of support which has been built by voluntary agencies and others around Kings Cross is simply not available in the Cabramatta area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I urge the government to reconsider that particular recommendation and to reconsider the other principles which I have raised today. I hope that in all of their work on this pilot program they are motivated primarily by the welfare of the child&mdash;primarily by the welfare of children who have done something which most children will not do. Every person in their life probably packed a vegemite sandwich, walked down the street, saying that they were never going to come home, and were home by teatime. It is not that sort of problem, and we are not dealing with those sorts of feelings. We are dealing with fundamental problems of people who are being abused, people who would prefer a different life and who are, nevertheless, in a wealthy society, living on the street.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, my time finishes at midnight next Sunday; but, if this matter comes before the Senate after my term expires, I hope that other senators will take up these points in debate. In the meantime, I hope that the government's task force will reflect some of the things that I have said, and hopefully the government's pilot program will be less onerous than I fear it will be, given the information I have provided to the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Acting Deputy President, I came here to speak about one matter, but I will take the opportunity to respond to some of the important matters that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Senator Wheelwright has raised in his contribution to the debate. I was, as the shadow minister for youth affairs, closely involved in the policy process. Many of the concerns that Senator Wheelwright has quite properly raised here today were raised with me when I was the shadow minister, and I was certainly able to give reassurance to people who raised similar concerns that that policy was not designed to have a coercive element in it. It is an important matter to raise. I think there are a number of people in the community who believe that the youth housing assistance package acts as some form of incentive to get young people to move away from home.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My own experience, travelling very extensively around Australia, talking to young people and visiting young people in the circumstances that Senator Wheelwright refers to, is that those people would be in an absolute minority, if they exist at all, and I suspect they do. Certainly, young people leave homes that are divided, homes where there is abuse and alcohol, and all of the other tragedies that occur in many Australian homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the policy that Mr Howard released last year, and during the election campaign, addresses a number of concerns identified by the House of Representatives committee on youth homelessness. One of the concerns was about ensuring that there was some income support early in the program. Many of the people I spoke to&mdash;both in the voluntary sector and the young people themselves&mdash;raised this matter of not being able to get any income support for many weeks, and how that created its own problems. In many respects, it saw young people turning to prostitution and to other ways of earning an income that no&hyphen;one in this society would want to see occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Wheelwright said he would be referring these matters to that task force and I encourage him to do so. I think it offers a positive step forward in making sure that our policy in relation to youth homelessness is more effective than what we have had in the past. I think it is a genuine attempt on the part of the Prime Minister and the coalition to address some of those problems. I think the more input comes from the community, and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2233"> from interested members of parliament, and the more these matters are debated publicly, the better it will be for young Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Wheelwright says, it is all very well for us to be talking about high levels of growth and low inflation, and for us to live comfortably, and have our first class cabins in aircrafts and our comfortable offices here, when only a few miles from this building, and in the hearts of most of our very successful looking capital cities, we can see that the problems of young Australians are not far below the surface. We all have a responsibility to do the best we can.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now turn to the matter that I rose to speak on, and that is to respond to an article in today's edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New Scientist </EMPHASIS>magazine, and a very similar article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald&hyphen;Sun</EMPHASIS> at page 31. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New Scientist</EMPHASIS> article&mdash;I am quite happy to table it if that is required&mdash;under the headline `US ship comes to the rescue of Russian polar team', in about the fourth paragraph, refers to Australia's lack of assistance to some Russian Antarctic expeditioners, particularly at the Mirny Station, which is in Australian Antarctic territory. Basically, because of the breakdown of their supply ship, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Akademik Federov</EMPHASIS>, and its having to return to Buenos Aires a few months ago, the expeditioners had to seek information from Australia on the availability of Australia's Antarctic vessel, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Aurora Australis</EMPHASIS>. They wanted to know whether the ship was available for charter to assist in providing very important supplies of food and other items to the wintering party of approximately 38 expeditioners from the Russian Antarctic service who will have to winter at the Russian base at Mirny.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The misleading part of the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New Scientist </EMPHASIS>magazine&mdash;also the misleading part of the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald&hyphen;Sun</EMPHASIS>, which was a virtual copy&mdash;says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Russian officials had first turned to Australia for help. They wanted to charter Aurora Australis, an Australian research vessel and icebreaker, to clear a path through the ice to allow the Akademik Federov to reach Mirny more quickly.</PARA>
<PARA>The article goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But negotiations with the Australians are thought to have broken down because the Russian govern <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> ment would not pay for the charter in advance. Rex Moncur, director of the Australian Antarctic Division, declined to comment on discussions between the two countries.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>At the outset, can I say that Mr Moncur, who is the head of the Australian Antarctic Division and an exceptional Australian and exceptional servant of the government of Australia in his role as the Antarctic Division chief, was quite right not to divulge to any journalist the discussions that took place between Australia, Russia and other nations in relation to this expedition. Those matters were, of course, confidential. I want to set out the facts for the record and for the benefit of a Mr Vincent Kiernan, whose by&hyphen;line is on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New Scientist</EMPHASIS>  magazine article, and Kristin Owen, the so&hyphen;called science reporter of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald&hyphen;Sun</EMPHASIS> .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I and my staff and the head of the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories were in Hobart on 24 May, Rex Moncur advised us that a request had indeed come from the Russian Antarctic expedition to find out whether or not <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Aurora Australis</EMPHASIS> would be available for charter for a mission to assist them in ensuring that their wintering party at the Mirny base could be restocked for the winter. Can I say that, entirely contrary to the articles that I refer to, the Australian Antarctic Division, with the close involvement of myself as the parliamentary secretary with responsibility for this division, ensured that within hours&mdash;it is fair to say&mdash;the Russians knew that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Aurora Australis</EMPHASIS> would be available. In fact on 25 May, less than 24 hours after the official sending of a request from the Russians, it was made quite clear to them that the Australians would be available to assist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The articles then refer to what has occurred subsequently and the success of a mission that involved the United States experimental ship <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Nathaniel B. Palmer</EMPHASIS> which was able to give some interim supplies to the Mirny base on 12 June. The Australian Antarctic Division and the Russian Antarctic division communicated virtually on an hourly basis on these matters from about 24 May&mdash;and the matters are still being discussed and communicated on. Part of those discussions was that Australia was quite successful, through our Antarctic <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2234"> division, in negotiating between the United States and the Russians&mdash;not that that was required in any diplomatic sense. It was purely, in a logistic and communications sense, a matter of informing the United States of the situation at the Russian base, informing the Russians of the proximity of the US vessel to the Russian base, communicating information about ice conditions, weather conditions, the steaming time it would take the United States ship to get to Mirny and whether that was possible, and keeping up to date on the requirement of the Australian vessel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This engagement by the Australian Antarctic Division, and our ready communication to them that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Aurora Australis</EMPHASIS> would be made available, is absolutely contradictory to what has been stated in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald&hyphen;Sun</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New Scientist</EMPHASIS> magazine. There were no negotiation breakdowns. The negotiations were not even negotiations. It was simply a question of: `Is the boat available for charter?' And the Australian response was: `Yes, it is.' So that is contrary to the article. I will refer to two documents that were part of those massive communications between Russia and Australia on this issue. I will quote from an E&hyphen;mail of 17 June directed to the Australian division. It is from the Russians and it reports on the success of the United States ship in supplying some tonnes of food to the Mirny station. It says, in conclusion:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The success was achieved due to the international cooperation in the Antarctic Treaty spirit. Many thanks to you and your colleagues for being so much involved in our problems. We also will be glad to help you if ever needed. Sincerely,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Valery Lukin.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>Another cable was received in relation to this matter, dated 31 May. I say this just to inform the Senate and particularly to inform those journalists who seek to write stories without even communicating with me or with the people at the Antarctic Division. This cable is a foreign affairs statement coming from the head, Arctic and Antarctic and Sea Administration, Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Monitoring of the Environment, from Russia. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Arctic and Antarctic and Sea Administration of the Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Monitoring of the Environment expresses its great appreciation for the attention of (the Australian Government) to the problems which have arisen in relation to the operations of the regular 41st Russian Antarctic expedition.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Russian Antarctic expedition acknowledges the receipt of information about the conditions for leasing the Australian icebreaker ship, Aurora Australis. We are currently studying this information. In the event of the need to request the use of this ship we will inform you.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Please accept our gratitude for your assistance, with sincere respect and best wishes, V A Martyshchenko.</PARA>
<PARA>I conclude, Madam Acting Deputy President, by saying that the operations of nations such as Russia, the United States, Australia, New Zealand and the other Antarctic nations in what is one of the most hostile environments&mdash;perhaps the most hostile environment&mdash;on this globe require a commitment to the ideals of the nations that go to Antarctica to conduct science and research. They require a level of international cooperation which is not demonstrated in many other parts of the globe. The sort of cooperation that occurred in this venture that the Australian government has been involved in is a demonstration of the sort of cooperation that is required in Antarctica.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regardless of the improvement in technology in terms of the ships, the aircraft that can get down to the Antarctic territories and the communications facilities, the weather conditions at Antarctica and the adjoining Southern Ocean are absolutely abysmal. They offer an incredible challenge to any man or woman who decides to venture down there. Those things have not changed since the time that Douglas Mawson set off down there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take this opportunity to say to Rex Moncur, the head of the Antarctic Division, to Jack Sayers, who handled much of the communication with his Russian counterparts, and to the Americans, who have also cooperated in this venture, that they all deserve to be congratulated by all Australian citizens and those who are wintering in Antarctica at the moment. We wish the Russian ship, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Akademik Fedorov</EMPHASIS>, the very best of luck, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2235"> because it will require much of that, in its final attempt to get to Mirny Station.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I rise to speak today about the rising democracy movement in Indonesia, personified by the struggle of Megawati Sukarnoputri to retain her chair of the PDI, the Indonesian Democratic Party. The struggle for greater democracy which is going on within Indonesia is one of the greatest challenges to the Suharto regime since 1965. As we all know, Suharto came to power amid much controversy in 1965, after ousting Sukarno in a coup attempt. The coup attempt, which apparently had some orchestration by Suharto, with the involvement of the CIA, led to a massive purging of leftists in Indonesian society. It is said that the 1965&hyphen;66 period resulted in the deaths of up to one million people who were pronounced communists and left&hyphen;leaning activists. This major massacre set the democracy and workers movements back 20 years, and they are only now resurfacing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are not many legitimate avenues for dissent in Indonesian society, which is why so much hope is pinned on the success of the PDI.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Heard Island and McDonald Island, which are Commonwealth territories, are being nominated for their natural heritage values.

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They seem to have written these questions to a script. Yesterday, in taking note of an answer, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate tried to tell the Senate something about the work that his government had done in terms of benchmarks. I was very interested to note that he was very selective in what he said. Let me just tell you why. He tried to explain away why the previous government had also been reviewing benchmarks, just like our government asked the Commission of Audit to have a look at benchmarks. Your government was in it boots and all because it was your Minister for Social Security that was trying to get benchmarks started.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Faulkner chose to only tell part of the story. He commissioned a study to look at the level of expenditure required by poor households. The budget standards project, which was contracted to the University of New South Wales, is still in progress and has not yet reported. I mentioned that yesterday. Of significant interest is other work which forms part of that broader review of DSS payment rates, which was commissioned by the previous Labor minister, Mr Baldwin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Faulkner did not mention those aspects but he would have had access to that information. That includes the policy discussion paper that was released by DSS in May last year. It also includes a deprivation standards project and a low income earners project. I will quote directly from that paper which was published last year. It stated amongst other things:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The use of male total average weekly earnings as an indicator of community earnings is also problematic.</PARA>
<PARA>So your government got what it wanted to know. It went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no reason to believe that something lower or higher than 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings is not a more appropriate benchmark.</PARA>
<PARA>That was the advice that was available to your minister at his request. What that demonstrates is that Senator Faulkner misled the Senate yesterday by not putting the full picture to the Senate. It also indicates that the previous government was looking at the very issues that they are condemning this government for looking at. It is apparently okay for a Labor government to look at benchmarks but there is something very sinister when it is a coalition government. Talk about hypocrisy! There is no reason to have double standards. If it is good enough for one government to do social policy research, it is good enough for another.</PARA></ANSWER>

Minister, would you agree that the last 15 years have been dominated by economic rationalist theories like deregulation, level playing fields&mdash;on which, I think, you wrote a paper&mdash;and downsizing equals greater efficiency. Are you aware that the so-called guru of downsizing, Stephen S. Roach, recently said he got it wrong and that `open-ended downsizing and real wage compression were recipes for industrial extinction'? Are you aware of recent employer surveys in the United States and Australia that show that downsizing has failed to deliver higher labour productivity and improved customer service, but have had a devastating effect on morale, staff commitment and motivation?  Have you, as minister for employment, raised these findings in discussion about the government's own downsizing plans, with 9,500 jobs going from the public sector, and possibly 30,000 from Telstra?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will take the opportunity over the next couple of days to scour back pages of the papers to look for complaints by Senator Kernot when Telstra was downsizing. That will be a matter of particular interest. Perhaps Senator Kernot might like to comment on that if I were to provide her with that information.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Basically, her question comes in three parts. She asked me to agree that economic rationalism has dominated the debate over the last decade. She asked me whether I have read something about someone she identifies as a guru of downsizing, who is now prepared to do a mea culpa and say that he got it wrong. And she asked me whether I have seen a particular piece of United States research and, subsequently, whether I have raised that with my colleagues in discussions about necessary downsizing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to each of those questions, of course economic rationalism has played a very significant part in the debate over the last decade. I see no value in answering that any other way. The battle of ideas is what politics is about. Of course it has played a significant part, as have other arguments&mdash;the contrary arguments, in fact. Anyone interested in politics would tell you that, when you raise <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2241"> an argument or propose a particular theory or particular approach to matters, you necessarily draw out those who would want to go the other way. So the answer to that is that perhaps it has not been the most dominant but it has undoubtedly been a dominant player in the battle of ideas over the last decade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to the guru who once promoted downsizing and now does not, there must be dozens of people over the world who have a view one day and another the next. So I do not choose to respond to that other than to say that, if that is the case, so what. Plenty of people change their minds on a whole range of things. As to the particular United States research, I do not know that I have seen it. I would be happy for Senator Kernot to forward it to my office.</PARA></ANSWER>

Minister, given your press release of 15 May 1996, which stated that expansion plans for uranium mining would be assessed under the `strictest environmental and heritage guidelines', what environmental conditions were attached to the approval of orebody 3 at the Ranger mine in the world heritage region of Kakadu National Park? Can you provide the details of the water management plan and tailings management arrangements to cater for the expansion of mining at orebody 3? If, as we believe, there is not either, why wasn't a new EIS and water management plan developed?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I remind the Senate that the area known as the Ranger lease, which includes orebody 3 and orebody 1, is not part of the Kakadu National Park, nor is it in a world heritage area. The environmental conditions associated with both orebody 1, which is now mined out, and orebody 3, which is about to be mined, are as follows: conditions specified in the Northern Territory Uranium Mining (Environmental Control) Act 1981; conditions and standards specified in the general authorisation to mine approved by the Northern Territory Department of Mines and Energy; and conditions required by the Commonwealth government as described in the environmental requirements which are attached to the Atomic Energy Act 1953 and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Northern Territory Uranium Mining (Environmental Control) Act 1981.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The application from ERA Ltd to develop orebody 3 was submitted to the Northern Territory minister for mines, as required under the UM(EC) Act. As required under the working arrangements between the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory governments, the application was forwarded to the OSS for technical comment. The Northern Territory minister is required to take prime regard of advice from the OSS. This procedure was followed in respect of the orebody 3 application.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Orebody 3 is similar in many characteristics to orebody 1, including size, grade, proximity to the Ranger mill and geological characteristics. The Office of the Supervising Scientist has advised me that mining orebody 1 has proceeded for 16 years without significant environmental impact. I anticipate a similar good result of environmental management during the mining of orebody 3 by application of the same environmental conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the second question, ERA has recently revised the Ranger five-year water management plan. This plan is to be assessed by stakeholders at the Alligator Rivers region advisory committee meeting on 5 July and by the environmental performance review to be conducted by the OSS and the Northern Territory Department of Mines and Energy on 1 July. Outcomes of these assessments will be put on the public record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tailings arising from the mining of orebody 3 are to be deposited in the orebody 1 pit. This disposal method has been developed following consultations between the OSS, the Northern Territory Department of Mines and Energy and ERA. I am advised that it will be an effective way of disposal in both the short and long term and that the environmental and health risks will be minimised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government, through the OSS, is in constant contact with ERA Ltd and the Northern Territory government authorities over the issue of environmental protection at Ranger through technical working groups and twice yearly environmental audits. Results of this work are made public by processes managed by the OSS. It is my view that these <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2243"> ongoing systems have a proven record of delivering high quality environmental outcomes and that the environmental conditions and level of supervision at Ranger provide a level of protection at least as good as the EIS process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The original approvals for mining in the area known as the Ranger lease included an exemption from the provisions of the EP(IP) Act 1974. This was, of course, because the terms and conditions for mining were settled under Mr Justice Fox's inquiry and that mining has proceeded subsequently pursuant to those terms and conditions. Commonwealth processes for environmental protection at Ranger have been in place for 20 years.

In other words, for many years those who would defend the public sector monopoly of Telstra used to argue that somehow we were different from the rest of the world because we had a very large country, a very low level of population and therefore there was something special about it. Even Senator Collins trots that line out from time to time in here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is particularly significant, I think, that when Mr Blunt last week made it perfectly clear where the corporation stood in relation to privatisation, he also said what he has said many times before, and that is that our most recent studies show that we are still about 30 per cent off world's best practice as measured by operating expenses per access line. We have to assume that our competitors will be at or near the benchmark level, so we have to attain that level too. How more frequently can you say it and in what plainer terms than that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2246"> The fact is that the company itself acknowledges that this is no longer a basis for defending the indefensible. Indeed, when I went with Mr Blunt to talk to some 1,200 Telstra employees in Sydney a few months ago, Mr Blunt gave them that precise message and they accepted it overwhelmingly. They ac knowledged the need for change. They acknowledged the need for the company to lift its game. I know that people like Senator Faulkner, who treat this place with contempt, particularly on certain occasions when they think it is more important to parade and make sure that their colleagues are not talking behind their backs, are not interested in this because they are captives of the trade union movement. But the fact is that Telstra can do a lot better than it does at present.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Kernot pretends that downsizing is something that one needs to get hysterical about in defending Telstra when, as Senator Vanstone pointed out, between 1990 and 1994, when Telstra downsized to the tune of about 25,000 employees purely by voluntary redundancies and redeployment, there was not a squawk from those who now confect anger on the subject.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once again, what we have on the Labor side is people not prepared to face up to the real issues. If you want some real entertainment, you ought to go along to some of these business lunches where people like Kim Beazley have to defend the indefensible. I can assure you that he squirms, just as do his other front bench colleagues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, I was told the other day of a discussion between a leading Australian businessman and former Senator McMullan, currently with the responsibility for industrial relations. When asked, `Why on earth does the outfit that privatised everything that moves now have an objection to privatising Telstra?', the best he could trot out was, `Well, we do not believe in partial privatisation.' It is pathetic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I simply urge the likes of Senator Schacht, when they are swanning off around the world during the recess, to take some time out, go over to your socialist colleagues in Cuba and Albania, explain to them why we are out of step, ask them why they have lost the faith, why they have a different view of the world to yours. It might be about time that you faced up to the reality that you are going to be the ones responsible for Telstra having a second-class future. If that is what you want to see, then I can assure you that you are not friends of Telstra.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said yesterday, in line with normal practice for contracts with the Commonwealth, the contract with KPMG to undertake the tasks of the special auditor contains provisions on how potential conflicts of interest are to be handled. The contract provides for substituted performance of the special auditor tasks for those indigenous organisations with which KPMG currently have a commercial relationship. The firm of Pannell Kerr Forster, or its national affiliates, will be used by KPMG to undertake the task of special auditor where there is a potential conflict of interest for KPMG.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">KPMG has advised the Commonwealth that there are approximately 60 indigenous organisations with which they have a commercial relationship of the 2,000 or so organisations which are likely to be scrutinised in the special auditor process. The contract also provides a notification and consent procedure for any further potential conflicts of interest which may arise during the contract period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The conflict of interest arrangements were part of the original tender assessment.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason we had to appoint a special auditor in the first place is that the previous government ignored problems of accountability and service delivery.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">ATSIC has been aware since 10 April of the nature of the information required to be provided by ATSIC to the special auditor, once appointed. I would like to repeat, as I have done almost every day for the past week, that organisations will continue to receive funding unless there is a serious breach of grant requirements. Even then, there are processes in place to provide interim funding where any delays might cause hardship to Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 6 June I wrote to the chairman of ATSIC, Ms Lois O'Donoghue, setting out the transitional arrangements.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Short), to a question without notice asked by Senator Cook today, relating to amendments made by the Senate to the Development Allowance Authority Amendment Bill 1996 concerning tax concessions for private urban road projects.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Short's trademark in this place is that of an obfuscating, bungling, stumbling incompetent. What he has added to that very doubtful reputation is that of being a misleader. On 19 June, to questions from Senator Faulkner, he misled this chamber over the details of the start date on sales tax. It was inconvenient for him that he then had to later change his information to the Senate but, of course, he never changed it all. He failed to withdraw the blackguarding he had engaged in against Senator Faulkner, and he conducted himself in a manner that can only be described as churlish in the extreme. That is strike one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Strike two occurred yesterday and today when Senator Short again misled this chamber. It is very important to get the facts of this misleading clear so that the degree of misleading can be understood and therefore appreciated. Yesterday he received a question from Senator Kernot about the Development Allowance Authority and, rather than answer the question that Senator Kernot had posed to Senator Short, Senator Short rounded on Senator Kernot, attacked her and accused her in about a five&hyphen; or six&hyphen;paragraph answer of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sabotaging some 40 projects in all in this country to the value of $2.5 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When one looks at Senator Short's answer one can see he used the words `sabotage' or `sabotaged' at least eight times. There is no doubt, there is no ambiguity at all, that he meant to directly say that Senator Kernot, and those of us in the opposition and other minor parties who had voted for an amendment when this bill was before the chamber, had sabotaged those projects. Today, when asked whether he withdrew or changed those words, he reaffirmed them. So for the second day in a row he used words which, unfortunately for him, do not in any way, shape of form equate with the truth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr President, it is unparliamentary to use the appropriate word that one might use in these circumstances, and I decline to use that word. But it is parliamentary to say in these circumstances that a misleading has occurred, and it has occurred for this reason: the bill in question was passed by this chamber. That is not a small fact. It is the large fact that sits awkwardly in front of Senator Short that, if the bill had not been passed, then there may have been some grounds for arguing the case&mdash;although they would have been, it has to be said, weak grounds, but a skilful advocate may have made something stronger from them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there are no grounds because the bill was passed, and passed with one amendment. It is therefore important to dwell for a moment on that amendment to see whether there is any comfort for Senator Short's extraordinary misleading in regard to that one amendment. Of course there is not. That one amendment referred only and exclusively to road construction in Australia from, I recall, 15 December 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only projects that would have been affected by that amendment are road constructions that would have attracted the development allowance authority grant from 15 December 1995, and not anything else. The projects that Senator Short referred to that make up the $2.5 billion are projects which he has itemised as follows: 18 projects in the mining industry&mdash;not true; 10 projects in the tourism industry&mdash;not true; six projects in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2253"> electricity, gas and water&mdash;not true; four projects in manufacturing&mdash;not true. The three projects in transport and storage are more than likely not true although he has declined to give information about those projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When my office rang the Development Allowance Authority during question time yesterday to seek verification, they said they would fax the information. When it did not come through my fax, they told us they had received a call from the office of the Treasurer and that, if we want the information, we have to write to the Treasurer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not a question that the Senate should take lightly. There is nothing that has happened here that has sabotaged those projects. To say that it has is to mislead. To continue to say it is to mislead again and offend twice. Senator Short should do the decent thing and now apologise and withdraw. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, when I heard Senator Short answer my question yesterday, at first I thought he may not have known what the Treasurer had announced earlier in the day. I thought he simply knew that we were debating the Development Allowance Authority Bill and he had not heard that the Treasurer had made a separate announcement. But listening to the end of the answer and hearing what you have repeated today, it is my view that you have misled the Senate. I believe you have misled us in two ways.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, I think you have been wrong about the amount you have stated because, as I understand it from the financial impact statement of the bill, we are talking about $920 million dollars, not $2.5 billion. Secondly, as Senator Peter Cook has explained, it is misleading to say that anything has been sabotaged when the bill has been passed. What it in fact means is that now the government has a choice. It has a choice whether it accepts the extension that they were asking for in the bill to the new applications which have come in after the closing date and the Senate amendment which says no to the reinstatement of urban roads as qualifying for infrastructure tax concessions, or whether it says no to the lot. It is the government's <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> choice. It is very misleading to say, when a bill has been passed, that something has been sabotaged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to revisit why the Democrats moved the amendment we did, because it has been misrepresented as well. We added a provision to the bill which affects only 40 privately constructed toll roads, not the 40 private projects that you were talking about. The Economic Planning Advisory Commission, the private infrastructure task force that was set up in October, looked at infrastructure borrowing tax concessions for the builders of private tollways. It said that privately financed projects are likely to be least advantageous for urban roads and that there was little efficiency to be gained from private ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You are the people who go on about efficiency all the time&mdash;making taxpayers' money work efficiently&mdash;and you try and reinstate a rort which gives a benefit to private developers and asks taxpayers to pay three times&mdash;through petrol, then to the tax collector, and then to the toll collector at the toll booths&mdash;for the privilege of using roads in New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the point. You are the ones that go on about efficiencies and you are the ones that are reinstating a very inefficient tax. Mr Costello's supposedly independent Commission of Audit said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not apparent within the current income tax arrangements why special tax treatment should apply to infrastructure borrowings.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the point. We should revisit the Treasurer's words when we are asking why this government, preoccupied with efficiency, chooses to reintroduce a rort.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should also revisit why the Treasurer said, when he was saying that it was not right for some state governments and local governments to have cars that were sales tax exempt:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Don't think that the government will sit by and allow the existing tax system to be riddled and rorted.</PARA>
<PARA>He sought to reintroduce a huge rort. That is the point, and that is why the Senate acted as it did. We said that we do not accept this. It has nothing to do with the construction of Sydney's eastern distributor. Tollways are <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2254"> incredibly profitable, and that is why investors are lining up to invest in them. That is the fact. When you say that we sabotaged something, Senator Short, I ask you to look again. This Senate passed the bill. The government got what it asked for. It got a little bit more that it did not want, as well. The choice is yours, but you have misled the Senate on two counts.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Gibson, of course, accuses the Australian Labor Party of participating in some sort of ambush and sabotage of a government bill on the Development Allowance Authority. Nothing could be further from the truth. The whole issue was raised by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in the other place on the question of the infrastructure bonds applying to roads. He did it in such a deliberately provocative way and sought to overturn the decisions made by Ralph Willis and Laurie Brereton who, on 15 December last year, announced changes to the infrastructure borrowing arrangements for urban roads.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The very simple reason was that the application of infrastructure bonds to urban roads, particularly given the City Link project in Melbourne, would have been totally uneconomic and would have led to major distortions and quite savage abuses of the policy processes in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">City Link, a project worth $1.2 billion with an additional cost of finance of some $0.7 billion, under these sordid, secret arrangements would have ended up costing between $7 billion and $8 billion. Its construction costs alone were $1.2 billion. For 34 years, profits would have been guaranteed to the City Link consortia involving Transurban. Individual taxpayers, individual commuters in Melbourne, would have to pay for some 34 years the equivalent, in today's prices, of $1,500 a year for the use of those roads&mdash;public assets which were funded by the public purse over many years but transferred to the private sector. By extraordinary means, with additional subsidies to the tune of $300 million added to the project but not funded by the private consortia, a construction project which should have cost $1.2 billion would have ended up costing between $7 billion and $8 billion over the 34&hyphen;year life of the project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On top of that, some 66 measures were introduced in the Victorian parliament to ensure that anti&hyphen;competitive actions would provide additional subsidies and protections&mdash;and to avoid the normal, common civil rights. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> As a result of the infrastructure bonds, uneconomic actions have been taken with a major distortion to the transport options provided to the City of Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a substantial policy issue that does not relate to ambush or sabotage. The matter was soundly and properly raised by the former Treasurer, Mr Ralph Willis, and the former Minister for Transport, Mr Laurie Brereton. They indicated that private road builders had inflated the construction costs through legal and financial complexities and had provided a risk premium to such an extent that there was a guaranteed profit. These actions resulted in the public purse being fleeced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What your government is trying to do is reintroduce those extraordinary rorts. You are trying to fleece the public of this country by allowing this action to proceed. The Senate has amended a bill that you have brought in here. It has not asked you to exempt those other measures; it has not sought to stop the other 35 projects. What it says is that you should exclude privatised roads&mdash;the transfer of a public asset to a private monopoly, in the case of Transurban and examples like that in the future&mdash;in such a way as to protect the public interest. You are seeking to avoid that obligation. For you to come in here and say that we are sabotaging the program of the government is totally inappropriate and just plain wrong.</PARA></SPEECH>

There had been no prior warning or indication that such an amendment was going to come forward.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I repeat the point that the Democrats introduced an amendment which really had nothing to do with the bill at hand. What the bill was about was basically a technical amendment to enable a wide range of projects in the mining industry, in tourism and so on, to qualify for the development allowance. The termination cut&hyphen;off date for applications was way back on 1 January 1993. What the bill was about was a minor technical amendment which, as I recall, the previous government had announced last year that they were going to do, but did not get around to doing it. That was all the bill was about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What then happened was that Senator Kernot heard a question and answer on the development allowance application as far as private urban roads were concerned. The Democrats thought, `Gee, this would be a pretty good idea. We will do something about this and tack it on as an amendment to the Development Allowance Authority Amendment Bill that was in the Senate.'

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I want to correct the record. I said that they made two telephone calls this morning. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2257"> The first of those calls was yesterday afternoon, which makes this story even worse. I will present the facts fairly to the Senate as I understand them. All of this was totally unsolicited by me. This is the sad and sorry track record of this matter with this organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Junjuwa is the largest Aboriginal community in the Fitzroy Valley. The chairman of the ATSIC regional council, Dick Bedford, yesterday signed the decision papers for CDEP grants to the local communities, including this one. Normally the money would start flowing from today. This community first faxed a letter to Senator Herron on Monday morning this week. All these letters, I might add, are not confrontationist; they are letters pleading for help. The council was hanging on every word Senator Herron said in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They wrote to him first on Monday morning. They wrote to him again yesterday morning. Junjuwa spoke to an adviser in the minister's office yesterday afternoon and was told there were transitional arrangements. The adviser in the minister's office yesterday afternoon said that if they had no budget problems they would be cleared and would have access to those transitional funds. I acknowledge that that is exactly what the minister said in here today. That was yesterday afternoon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They then informed the adviser that this was in direct contradiction to what the local ATSIC office was telling them. You could imagine the confusion on the ground here. They then relayed the answer of the minister's adviser to the ATSIC office and asked them, not unreasonably, to put their advice in writing. The ATSIC office did.

Tribunal reviews are regularly programmed by the Tribunal Secretariat and, while the proportion of complaints requiring review may increase in future (particularly in relation to disability complaints involving medical evidence), there is no basis for concluding that the requirement that the Chairperson or Deputy Chairperson must be a part of the panel impedes the timeliness of the review process at present, or is likely to do so in the foreseeable future.</ENTRY></ROW>

The Government is presently of the view that the SCT's stance on this matter will encourage trustees to provide reasons and thereby lead to the desired outcome without the need for legislative amendment.

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">AUSTRALIA CHINA RELATIONS</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am pleased to table this report of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee on Australia&hyphen;China Relations. It is an extensive review of one of Australia's most important bilateral relationships that has been conducted at a time of significant change, not only within China itself, but also within the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region and globally. China's economy continues to change rapidly as the Chinese Government strives to build a socialist market economy. China is also on the brink of ushering in the age of the second&hyphen;generation leaders. The leadership has followed the broad policies espoused by Deng Xiaoping and, in particular, is now united on the importance of maintaining market&hyphen;based reform of the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has also taken into account international factors affecting China and its relationship with Australia. Both countries are members of the Asia Pacific Economic Co&hyphen;operation and the more recently formed ASEAN Regional Forum. This reflects the common interests both countries have in seeing that peace and stability prevail in the Asia Pacific. Yet there are a number of tensions and potential flash points which threaten the current state of relative calm in the region. Taiwan and the South China Sea are two such regional concerns, while China's harder line on Hong Kong of late and the recurring tensions in China&hyphen;United States relations have also affected the atmosphere in the region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These domestic and international developments are all of interest to Australia, both in the context of its relationship with China and Australia's overall engagement with Asia. Thus the Committee's inquiry and report has been opportune.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be noted that this is the second inquiry involving Australia and China conducted by a Senate committee. In 1983&hyphen;84, the former Senate Standing Committee on Industry and Trade conducted an inquiry into prospects for Australia&hyphen;China trade. However, this is the first time that a parliamentary committee has reviewed the wider bilateral relationship.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a starting point, the Committee agreed that Australia's relationship with China should be based on friendship but still be business&hyphen;like in order to pursue national interests and enhance mutual interests. The relationship should also be based on respect, understanding and trust and be robust enough to discuss sensitive issues without affecting the stability of the relationship. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2263"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The relationship has been reasonably good but there are still thorny issues which will test the strength of the relationship. However, the relationship has endured previous rough stretches and the Committee is confident that the relationship has matured enough to deal with difficult issues without compromising the integrity of the relationship.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In any bilateral relationship, both sides have to work hard to sustain the harmony and productiveness of that relationship, particularly where the two countries have fundamentally different political and social systems, as do Australia and China. This requires frequent contact at all levels of government to build up the understanding and trust necessary to ride over any rough patches which may occur in any relationship.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The importance of building understanding and trust at all levels of the bilateral relationship, from the governmental level through to commercial ties and defence exchanges, is a major theme running through the report. Mutual understanding depends on both countries learning more about each other, in terms of language, culture, people and perceptions. Central to this two&hyphen;way learning process is the need for exchanges of people across all the areas of the relationship. These exchanges should help cultivate trust which is an important antidote for fear and misperception that can damage relationships, particularly during periods of difficulty and friction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In light of recent tensions in the region, the development of cultural and social relations continue to be as important and relevant now as they were at the time of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Australia and China in 1972, when China was a more closed society. The Committee has recommended an increase in the real level of resources available to the Australia&hyphen;China Council (ACC) for its work in developing social and cultural ties and for its support of bilateral economic relations to a level similar to that in the ACC's first years of activities. The Committee has also recommended that the Department of Employment, Education and Training at least maintain funding levels for Chinese language and cultural studies in Australia and encourage State Government education authorities to do likewise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commerce continues to be at the heart of Australia&hyphen;China relations. A significant section of the report and over half of the Committee's recommendations to the Government focus on economic and investment matters. This largely reflects the common view that the trading connection between Australia and China is the mainstay of the overall relationship.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The economic relationship has both grown and changed significantly since the first Senate Committee report on Australia&hyphen;China trade in 1983&hyphen;84. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> In 1982&hyphen;83, total two&hyphen;way trade was worth $890 million. In 1995 it was worth nearly $7 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently bilateral trade is growing at close to 20 per cent annually. China is Australia's fastest growing export market in East Asia. Australian investment in China is growing even faster, having doubled in the time since the inquiry began. Australia is the second most important destination, after Hong Kong, for Chinese overseas investment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What these figures do not show, however, is the growing sophistication and maturity of the economic relationship. As both economies have changed internally over the last 15 years, so too has the nature of the trade between them changed. Commodity exports remain the core of Australia's exports to China, but they have fallen as a proportion of total exports with the rise of exports of raw materials and energy products needed for China's economic transformation, and with the entry of Australian manufactures and services into the China market. Chinese exports to Australia have also changed qualitatively, with traditional labour&hyphen;intensive exports falling as a proportion of total exports with the rise of light industrial exports and exports of more sophisticated electrical and machine goods.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The economic relationship looks set to expand further and this should be a high priority for Australia in its relations with China. With China's economy booming and foreign investment and aid sought, China offers considerable opportunities for the Australian business community across a breadth of sectors. Australia is well&hyphen;placed to capitalise on the market openings offered by China's economic transformation. Apart from the natural complementarity between the two economies, Australia has established in China a reputation as a fair and reliable trader. The sound state of the political relationship, and Australia's image as a non&hyphen;threatening regional neighbour, mean that commercial links are not hamstrung by some of the political tensions other western trading partners experience in China.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's fast&hyphen;growing investment presence in China also promises to generate follow&hyphen;on export business for Australian companies. As investment is now seen as driving trade, especially in North East Asian markets such as China's, Australian investment in China has strengthened Australia's long&hyphen;term strategic position in the Chinese economy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, there is a view that Australia has not made the most of the opportunities presented by the China market. The recent performance of Australian manufactures to China, for example, has been inconsistent. What appears to be at the root of this problem is a lack of strategic commitment to exporting from Australian companies. Such an approach is a recipe for failure in the competitive <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2264"> China market. As the report makes clear, success in China depends on building long&hyphen;term relations and a track record for reliability&mdash;hallmarks of Australia's success in primary product exports to China. The Committee has recommended that the East Asia Analytical Unit of the Department of Foreign Affairs undertake analysis of Australian manufactures exports and East Asian markets, and report to the Government accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also recommends that the Government should conduct a study of the opportunities for Australian business presented by the emergence of regional markets in China. China is commonly described as "one country, many markets. Many of those markets are forming along regional lines, and some present opportunities for which Australian companies should be well&hyphen;placed to take advantage. While some Australian companies have begun to explore and enter these emerging markets, the Committee believes more needs to be known about the long&hyphen;term market potential, as well as the obstacles and risks, of these regional markets before Australian companies will begin to see them as viable alternatives to China's coastal markets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In reviewing Australia's economic performance in China, the Committee looked at the overall approach employed by Australia and, in particular, the role of government in assisting Australia's economic interests. Government support remains crucial in a market such as China's. Chinese officials and customers see it as a seal of approval on the value of a private company's bid, a factor which helps overcome some of the limitations Australian small to medium&hyphen;sized enterprises (SMEs) face when up against larger competitors from the united States or Japan. Government support also helps open doors in an economic system where personal connections are all&hyphen;important, and can prove essential if business people run into complications with China's opaque and arbitrary regulatory system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yet the role of government in the relationship is changing, if not declining with both the rise of the non&hyphen;state sector in China but also the growing presence of Australian companies in China. These developments necessitate some degree of change in the way Australia conducts business in China. The Committee believes that the peak bilateral government body, the Joint Ministerial Economic Council (JMEC), should be retained to oversee economic relations between Australia and China. But the Committee recommends a review of the level below the JMEC, the Joint Working Groups (JWGs), to examine whether there needs to be changes made to ensure that the JWGs reflect the devolution of economic power and regionalism of the Chinese economy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also sees the JMEC operating as an umbrella for the new groupings that are forming amongst Australian companies. The Committee <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> strongly endorses the merger of the Australia China Business Council and Australia China Chambers of Commerce and Industry which is imminent. Likewise, it also supports the merger of a number of Australian Business Groups based in Hong Kong and major centres in China. The formation of these united bodies should help project a clear Australian identity in the China market and overcome some of the disunity that has been a problem for Australia in China.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite China's open door policies and continued relaxation of restrictions on foreign involvement in its economy, the China market still presents significant obstacles and challenges for Australian companies. China is a high&hyphen;cost and high&hyphen;risk market. Tariff and non&hyphen;tariff barriers remain at levels far higher than those in Australia, which is one of the reasons for Australia's current trade deficit with China. While it has a large body of law, much of it is opaque and its enforcement arbitrary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These problems make it essential that China joins the World Trade Organisation (WTO) on the basis of an unequivocal commitment from China to the WTO's rules&hyphen;based standards and market disciplines. Any compromise of the WTO's rules for the sake of securing China's membership would not only undermine the basis of the liberalised international trade system but would also reduce the momentum for further market reform of the Chinese economy. The Committee has recommended that the Government continue to press, at both the bilateral and multilateral level, for China to accede to the WTO on the basis of a clear commitment from China to implement WTO rules within clearly specified timeframes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has also recommended that steps be taken towards establishing a bilateral program of work experience exchanges between Australian and Chinese companies. Such an exchange program would meet the current priority China places on acquiring modern management and technical skills from advanced economies. It would also increase mutual understanding of the different economic systems and business cultures in both countries which should help overcome both Chinese misperceptions of the Australian economy and the difficulties Australian companies encounter when trying to thread there way through China's complex economic system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee supports but wishes to see enlarged the approach adopted by Australia towards China on defence. Strategic engagement with China, rather than containment or moves to isolate China, should remain the guiding principle of Australian foreign and defence policy, unless circumstances change dramatically.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends the development of officer exchanges between the Australian Defence <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2265"> Force and the People's Liberation Army as an important measure for building better understanding between the two countries on defence and regional security issues. This would not only complement the bilateral strategic dialogue that currently takes place between both countries' defence establishments but should also help develop channels of communication that are important both for avoiding misperceptions and during periods of difficulty. Such contacts would be a step towards Australia's larger goal of engaging China more deeply in the evolving network of multilateral regional security ties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also recommends that the Australian Government should encourage China to publish a white paper on China's defence policy and military development. One of the reasons for concern within the region over China's growing but still modest power projection capabilities is the lack of transparency surrounding China's defence planning. The uncertainty over China's long&hyphen;term strategic ambitions arising from this lack of transparency has the potential to breed hostile perceptions towards China. To avoid this occurring, China needs to be encouraged to embrace both the letter and the spirit of defence transparency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has also recommended that a priority in Australian policy towards South China Sea should be the promotion of efforts to establish a multilateral framework for conflict prevention in the South China Sea. Although the situation in the South China Sea remains relatively low&hyphen;key, the fact that the military forces of the various claimants operate often in close proximity points to the risk of an accident happening that could escalate to a higher level. Establishing a framework for conflict prevention would help counter such incidents occurring.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With regard to human rights in China, the Committee supports Australia's policy of constructive, non&hyphen;confrontational dialogue with China on these matters. The Committee believes that linking sanctions in other areas to improvements in human rights is neither productive in maintaining a viable relationship with China nor effective in producing the desired improvements. The breadth of Australia's connections with China at all levels of the relationship offers channels through which Australia make it concerns known and sensitise Chinese people to international accepted standards of human rights behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has significant interests in both Hong Kong and Taiwan. Hong Kong is Australia's tenth largest trading partner and a major destination of Australian overseas investment. It is in Australia's interests that there is a smooth transition in Hong Kong between British and Chinese rule and that all commitments made in relation to the future of Hong Kong are honoured on all sides. Maintaining <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the right to exercise personal freedoms in Hong Kong after 1997 is crucial both for the human rights of the Hong Kong people but also to the health of the Hong Kong economy and overseas confidence in its stability, two factors which are in turn important to China's won economic interests. The Committee believes that the Australian Government should monitor developments in Hong Kong and make appropriate representations to China if such human rights are restricted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the establishment of diplomatic relations with China in 1972, Australia has regarded Taiwan as a province of China and accordingly has not had political relations with Taiwan. This has not precluded Australia developing a strong economic relationship with Taiwan. Taiwan is now Australia's ninth largest trading partner. In pursuing an economic relationship with Taiwan, a country, which has diplomatic relations with China, may find it difficult to keep that relationship solely within the bounds of the economic sphere. In such circumstances, arrangements might be entered into with Taiwan, which in the opinion of China cross the line into the political arena and thus provoke protests from Beijing. Openness with China should help to allay any Chinese concerns that Australia is not adhering to its responsibilities under the 1972 agreement. That is not to say that Australia and China might disagree on whether some action by Australia in relation to Taiwan is consistent with Australia's obligations. As it is a bilateral agreement, the terms of that agreement are subject to interpretation by both sides. If Australia and China do not interpret something in the same way, they should try to achieve accommodation through discussion and negotiation. The Committee does not believe, however, that one side has the right to insist that its view should always prevail. Provided that both sides adhere to the fundamental principles underpinning the relationship, there should be recognition given to the dynamic nature of the relationship, as well as to the regional and global environment, by the adoption of a reasonable approach to new policies. Both sides need, however, to negotiate on the basis of their national interests in good faith.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee endorses the Australian Government's policy of not supporting Taiwan's efforts to put on the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly the question of appropriate representation for Taiwan's population. This is an internal matter for China and Taiwan to work out between themselves.</PARA></SPEECH>

I happened to be directly involved in the formulation of the terms of reference that came to the Senate and I have worked very closely with other senators over a three-year period now in the determination of the 12 chapters and the 23 recommendations of the report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a comprehensive assessment of the relationship between Australia and China&mdash;that is, it deals with the political relationship, the economic relationship, and social and cultural aspects of the relationship. It deals with particular parts of the economy&mdash;with commerce, with trade, with joint ventures, with investment from one country to the other and with every aspect of our growing economic relationship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The terms of reference also required us to directly assess the concerns of Australians in China relating to human rights. A full chapter was devoted to this in the report. We were also required in our terms of reference to look at the situation in Taiwan and Hong Kong. Sometimes we referred to three Chinas. Of course, there is only one China&mdash;and we recognise the republic in Beijing as China&mdash;but we are aware of the separation, at least for the time being, of Taiwan and Hong Kong as British colonies which are to be handed back to China in a year's time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are very real concerns in Australia about the particularities of the second and third Chinas, as they are colloquially called, when looking at this part of Asia. I think that there is a mature and well developed assessment of each of these economies in the report. There is bipartisan support to maximise Australia's commercial relationship with Taiwan and to in no way whatsoever change the political relationship which exists&mdash;that is, that we recognise the government of China in Beijing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also encourage, as the representatives of China and Taiwan see fit, the negotiations for a harmonious and peaceful relationship of more and more substance between China and Taiwan. We see it as being in the interests of China, Hong Kong and Australia that there is a stable transition in a year's time when Hong Kong reverts back to Chinese sovereignty.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the introduction to the report there is reference to five members of the committee visiting China. The chair of the committee was my very good friend Senator Gerry Jones. I was deputy chairman of the committee during that period. Accompanying us on the visit were Senator Chris Ellison, Senator Sue West, Senator Bryant Burns and the secretary, Paul Barsdell. We had a wonderful team approach while we were visiting China and it directly affected the way in which we received scores of submissions for our inquiry. That all helped in the writing of our report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to acknowledge and thank, as we do in the report, the Foreign Affairs Committee of the National People's Congress of China&mdash;in particular, the chairman, Mr Zhu Liang, whom I have met on several visits to China, and the deputy chairman, Mr Zhu Qizhen, who has served as China's ambassador to the United States. These two gentlemen are extraordinarily experienced in foreign affairs matters relating to the China.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We visited Beijing, Lanzhou in Gansu Province, Qingdao, Shanghai and Shenzhen. We wanted to visit the major cities, Beijing and Shanghai. We wanted to visit some coastal regions in this part of Shandong and Shenzhen near Qingdao, but we also wanted to go to an inland region. In this case, it was the capital of Gansu Province.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While we were in Hong Kong we were able to meet with Governor Patten, the senior Chinese official in Hong Kong, Mr Zhou Nan, and the President of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong, the Hon. John Swaine. These three discussions were of great value to us and formed the chapter we have on Hong Kong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the couple of minutes remaining, I wish to refer to the growing prospects of Australia having economic and other relationships with China which will be of mutual benefit to the two countries. Before I make those few remarks, I wish to join the chairman and the whole committee in thanking the secretary of the committee, Mr Paul Barsdell, the research officer, Alistair Sands, and the other staff for their professional work and diligent personal assistance to us. Three years ago there were <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2267"> others who assisted this committee, but they no longer make up the secretariat of the committee. They are first&hyphen;class members of the Department of the Senate and I thank them very sincerely for their work. I thank the members of the committee for the care they took on the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final remarks I wish to make relate to the 70&hyphen;year period which began in 1980. That was when Deng Xiaoping gained full political support, after the 10 lost years of the cultural revolution, for the open door policy. For the first time in history, China actually began to emerge into the modern world. Prior to that there was the cultural revolution, the ups and downs of Mao Tse&hyphen;tung's period since 1949, the civil war, the Japanese aggression, the war lord period and the period of imperialism that cut up and divided China. Before that there was the dynastic history without which we would not see the strengths of the modernisation that we now have in China.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Up until 1979, and the beginning of Deng Xiaoping's open door policy, China was submerged and not living up to its full potential. It is only with the progressive economic policies of modernisation, of realistic economic achievement and of prosperity for the people of China that followed Deng Xiaoping's initiatives that we have seen China given a chance. It has been 17 years that we have observed this. Both in China and in Australia people are looking forward to 2050&mdash;a 70&hyphen;year period from 1980 to 2050; if you like, a 70&hyphen;year period in which it is expected that China will become the biggest gross economy in the world and the largest population in the world. This is of enormous significance for Australia and Australia's relations within APEC and north Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I reiterate, as the committee does in this report and in its recommendations, that we have a bipartisan approach to China in this parliament and in the nation, that Australia, for its own national interest, needs to see its opportunities and to build, in all the ways that we have outlined in this quite large and comprehensive report, a relationship of mutual benefit, of real trust and real openness so that we see the benefits flowing to the Australian and the Chinese people. I have very much <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> enjoyed involvement in this Senate committee and in this report in particular. I commend the report to the Senate and, indeed, to all Australians.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the most important happenings was when the committee went to China, Hong Kong and Taiwan to look at on&hyphen;the&hyphen;ground issues that we wanted to relate to the report. I have to thank the ambassador here for his assistance in having the foreign affairs committee of the National People's Congress issue the invitation to the committee to visit China. That, in itself, was a fairly great happening for the committee: to be one of the first Senate committees to go overseas to discuss some of the report that it was preparing at that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also thank the secretary, Paul Barsdell, and his staff for the way in which the report was put together and for the assistance given to committee members on the trip to China and back in Australia where we undertook public inquiries and put down parts of the report. One could run through the report now and talk about some of the recommendations in it, but could I make a further recommendation to members of this Senate and to members interested in foreign affairs that it would be well worth their time and effort to look at the report on China.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2268"> I believe, because of the comprehensive way in which the China report has been put together, it would form a basis for either an historical or an up&hyphen;to&hyphen;date version of what is happening in China today. It would also give encouragement to business people, to foreign affairs people and to other people to undertake some of the recommendations that we make. I will not deal with the recommenda tion that is being discussed in the House of Representatives for the moment. I will leave that to Senator West. We certainly make a recommendation here in relation to the matter that is before the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The visit to China and then to Hong Kong, where we spent some time talking to Governor Patten and to the Chinese main negotiator, Zhou Nan, was probably some of the best time that committee members spent, hearing the views of both men in relation to the handing back of Hong Kong in 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The visit to Taiwan was done in a private capacity. I went, as did Senator Teague. We had discussions with a number of people but I want to relate to the Senate one discussion that I had in Taiwan. We spent some time speaking to some of the people involved in commercial enterprises in Taiwan. One particular person&mdash;I will not name people or companies at this stage&mdash;bought a high&hyphen;rise property in Sydney and established a manufacturing industry making electrical goods, motors and those types of things. I asked him, `Why would you go to Australia to develop an industry?' He said, `I went to Australia for two reasons: firstly, we didn't have the room in Taiwan to expand; and, secondly, we didn't have the labour. In Australia you have the room and you have the labour.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I then asked him an obvious question coming from someone who was involved in trade unions, `What sort of problems did you have with the Australian workers? Did you have any industrial problems?' He said, `No, we didn't.' I said, `Why would that be?' He said, `Because we made arrangements and agreements before we started the enterprise and we had no problems.' I said, `My second question would be: how many Taiwanese did you employ?' He thought for a while and then said, `One. By the way, if you would like to meet the manager of our world enterprise, I would be only too pleased to introduce him to you.' He brought him in and he was an Australian who had just been appointed the world manager.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What was said to us that day was that governments in Australia should give more encouragement to people from the Asian region to invest in Australia by way of some <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sort of tax or investment incentive, something to encourage them to come. He said that he came without any and believed that he did the right thing. He also believed that a lot of other business people would invest in Australia, would develop industries and would employ Australians if they were given just that little bit of encouragement. They now have a policy&mdash;I think they call it `Looking south'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point I would like to make is that, as well as talking about employment during my discussion with the world manager, I said that there must have been other reasons why he would spend that sort of money in Australia on that sort of development. He told me that there was.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He said that one of the very important points he had to tell me was that, whenever he sells goods that have been manufactured in Australia overseas, he immediately finds a market. They are sought after because they are manufactured in Australia. I asked about the costs in relation to Australian workers, and he said that we were very competitive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A story like the one Senator Teague and I picked up during the committee investigation is one that we do not hear too often. But that is the sort of story we ought to look at. If we are going to be involved in Asia, we ought to look at ways to encourage some of that Asian investment into Australia, thereby creating employment for Australians and an export industry for Australia. I think it is very important that those points be considered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not sure there is much more I want to say, because I believe that most of the important points are contained in the report. However, I will further express my gratitude to Paul Barsdell, to the secretariat, to the people who assisted us and to the other members of the committee, particularly those who went on the trip to China. There are a lot more stories I could tell, but I know that other committee members have something to say on this report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The visit to China, Hong Kong and later to Taiwan&mdash;for those members who went there&mdash;was one of the most valuable trips undertaken by any committee in the Senate. I think that is shown in the basis of the report <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2269"> and its recommendations. I once again say thanks to those members of the committee who played a role in both the trip and the report.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to be able to participate in the tabling of this report and to speak on it. This is one report that the Senate can stand well proud of. It is one that has taken some considerable time, but I think the content is such that it will be of vital importance and of great value and benefit to many people who are doing business with China and many people who are interested to know more about the great country that it is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was one of those fortunate enough to be invited to visit the country. I welcome having taken that opportunity. It certainly gave me a greater understanding of the country, the customs and the variety within the country. It is a very large country&mdash;in fact, larger than Australia. It has a population in the order of 1.2 billion, but its land formation is such that the people are able to live on only 10 per cent or less of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The terrain of the country is very harsh. We talk about our harsh terrain here, but they have mountains that cover large areas, including an area which is part of the Himalayas. That harsh terrain adds to their logistics, infrastructure needs and infrastructure variation. One thing that struck me very greatly was the difference between the infrastructure available in Lanzhou, which is in Gansu province in the middle of the country, and the infrastructure around Beijing, Qingdao, Shenzhen and Shanghai. They were vastly different&mdash;like cheese and chalk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recall the trip by bus from Lanzhou airport to Lanzhou town. The road was under repair, and we took an hour and a half to get to the town and an hour and a half to return a couple of days later. I also recall that the trip caused someone's bottle of mai tai to break, and the smell of mai tai through a bus at five in the morning is not one I would recommend to many people. It is not particularly nice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trip did give us a very good understanding of the infrastructure variation that exists in the country and the problems this <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> causes when moving produce and commodities from one side or end to the other. Those problems are dealt with in the report, and they indicate why the coastal regions trade offshore. It is in fact easier for them to import a number of goods and commodities to work with than actually bring them from the far side of the country. That is a very important point to remember.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To the committee secretariat who helped us, I say thank you. To the three members of the committee who after midnight on Sunday will no longer be members of the Senate, I say that I have enjoyed working with the three of you. I have enjoyed your input and our conversations, stories and times together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are 23 recommendations in the report. The one I would like to deal with is recommendation 7, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Committee recommends that the Government reconsider the decision to cease the Concessional Finance Facility (CFF) program in China, taking into account the affect such a move would have on Australia's wider economic and political interests and Australia's humanitarian efforts in China.</PARA>
<PARA>The CFF, as this program is called, is actually part of the DIFF program, and DIFF has certainly been causing some interest in the other place. A lot of evidence before us stated that this program had been a major benefit to both China and Australia, and that is very important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A commercial review was done on Australia's aid program to China. It found that the return on every $100 of official development assistant&mdash;called ODA&mdash;was close to $300. The review stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some $285 million in development assistance between 1981 and 1992 generated total business of $883 million.</PARA>
<PARA>They are the sorts of benefits that this program has given to Australia, but there have been follow on benefits as well. Because our companies have been in the country and worked with the people, there has been follow on business, with no assistance from the government or anything like that attached to it. Those companies have been able to get the foothold they need with the assistance from <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2270"> this program, and then expand their business into that country with a very beneficial effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australia&hyphen;China Chamber of Commerce was alone in raising the issue of community development and the pursuit of commercial objectives. They called for the balance to move further towards the commercial side, despite the program having moved in the right direction over the past five years. However, they stated that Australia's development assistance must continue to fulfil community development obligations as well as be trade focused.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We heard stories of a desalination plant project undertaken by Memtec in Lanzhou. That is just one. Ausmelt were involved in others. That part of chapter 6 is well worth reading. The committee is not convinced there is a pressing need for Australia's development assistance program to become more trade focused than it already is. We think that it has a good balance, but we do not want to see the CFF program reduced, diminished or changed. We also noted that, of the 1994-95 program budget to AusAID, which totalled $98 million, over half, $58 million, was designated for CFF projects which would assist Australian companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are gravely concerned that the government has reported that it intends to cut this program because in doing this report we were given first-hand evidence of the value of this program in two ways. It is of value to the Australian companies who use the program to provide assistance to a country and then follow up with follow-on projects, and it is of value so far as the development of a country that receives that assistance is concerned. I urge members of the Senate and everyone to very carefully read and digest this section and to wholeheartedly support recommendation 7.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once again, I take this opportunity to thank everybody who has been involved with the project and this committee report. It has been one of the most enjoyable and fulfilling ones I think I have ever undertaken. We went to China in April 1994, and in September of last year I had a chance to visit China again for the women's conference. It was interesting to see how much less restriction there was and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> how much freer the area around Beijing was 18 months later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had the opportunity in September of last year to move freely around Beijing, to use the taxis and the private and public sector transport systems, and to experience, I suppose, part of the traffic problems now being inflicted upon not just Shanghai, which we experienced when we were there in April 1994, but also Beijing. I have a great love for the country and look forward to being able to return to see what is happening.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The visit by the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee to China at the invitation of that country I believe was somewhat ground breaking at the time. I do not think a Senate committee had been beyond the Pacific at the invitation of a foreign country. I went along much as the junior senator, if you like, on that trip. There were others much more experienced than I in matters relating to China. I refer to the chairman, Senator Gerry Jones, Senator Baden Teague, who has a very longstanding interest in China, Senator West and Senator Bryant Burns. I believe that visit really proved to be the foundation on which this seminal report was constructed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the outset, I would like to thank Paul Barsdell, the committee secretary, for his work over the last three years. Paul Barsdell travelled with us to China and then assisted the committee in the writing of this report&mdash;and the report has been three years in the making. Indeed, I was a member of the committee when Senator Jones was chairman. I was then off it for a period whilst Senator Woods was chairman, and then I came back on it whilst Senator Forshaw was chairman. I believe that indicates just how much time has gone by during the making of this report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Jones did a remarkably good job in China as our chairman. I also pay tribute to his wife, Rita, who contributed in a significant way to the work of the committee. I remember the Australia&hyphen;China Chamber of Commerce referring to how useful it was to have a spouse on the trip. We picked up another dimension, as it were. One of the aspects we did not pick up readily was the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2271"> loneliness of expatriates working in China and the problems that confronted them in relation to their family and their being so far from home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I stated, this is a seminal piece of work. It covers a whole range of issues. A great deal of it deals with the economic relations and the social and cultural ties. The committee does not shy away from any of the more sensitive aspects dealing with human rights issues, such as Tibet, the one child policy, orphanages&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before we adjourned the debate, I was indicating the Greens' support for the objection to these two items in the schedule, which the opposition and Australian Democrats have already spoken about. I was pointing out at the time progress was reported that there is support&mdash;I am sure the government is aware of it&mdash;for the abolition of ATSIC and an administrator being put in place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think that that by any means should be taken as support for the amendment that the government has here. I was going to read a letter by way of example, but unfortunately I will have to refer to it from memory because I have folded my papers away. Our office received some phone calls and at least one letter where people asked, `Why are you supporting ATSIC when ATSIC has been <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> very deficient in reaching out to a lot of communities across Australia? Wouldn't it be better to abolish it and put an administrator in charge?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said, `What would you want to do that for?' They said, `So we could get better service delivery.' I said, `What would you think if the administrator was put in place to make sure that the accountability mechanisms and the bureaucratic mechanisms of ATSIC were strengthened and entrenched?' They were horrified to hear this because that is the very problem. They think there is already so many bureaucratic mechanisms in place that the direct service delivery of ATSIC and the direct funding are being interfered with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So a lot of the support that the government may be receiving for these measures should be, at least on my hypothesis, investigated to see whether what people had in mind under these amendments is exactly what would happen. They need to be given the information to ascertain that for themselves before anybody in this chamber can claim decisively that there is support within the Aboriginal community for the measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, I have already put on the record that I have been a critic of ATSIC. I am not a person who has not been on the public record fully in support of it. I have expressed concerns and I still have those concerns. If I felt that this particular provision would assist in that regard, I assure the government that it would have my support. My concern is that this will actually make ATSIC worse in what it has been criticised for rather than better. It is for that reason that I am supporting the amendments.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are talking about subsection 1 and the definition of `commission administrator'. I want to ask some questions about that. I understand that is defined by reference to proposed section 78B. Proposed section 78B talks about the appointment of an administrator. It says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Minister is satisfied that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) the administration by the Commission of the Commission's money has involved fraud or gross mismanagement . . .  <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2272"> </PARA>
<PARA>Is there any ability to go to the AAT to challenge the minister's decision? In any event, does that not leave the commission very vulnerable if an administrator can be appointed by the minister on the test of satisfaction of fraud? Would it be unusual for a decision as to fraud&mdash;distinct from, say, misconduct&mdash;to be made by a minister? Is it not a very serious matter for a whole group of people, being the commission, as I understand it, to be dismissed simply&mdash;and I use that word advisedly&mdash;on the test of a minister being satisfied? Why is the test for that different from that applied for the appointment of an administrator?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at proposed section 78B(2) you see that it refers to proposed section 78F, which goes to the conditions for an appointment of an administrator, which is defined in the proposed section we are now dealing with&mdash;that is, the proposed section that defines `commission administrator'. In relation to the tests where a minister may terminate the appointment of an administrator, in proposed section 78F(3), for example, that can be done only if the administrator is guilty of misbehaviour or becomes bankrupt. I see that as an objective test of fact; whereas the dismissal of the commission itself is done on a subjective test of the minister being satisfied. I am wondering why that difference was made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following on from that, the administrator can be dismissed if the minister thinks that the performance of the administrator has been unsatisfactory for a definite period of time. So, even within proposed section 78F, why is there a different test as to the basis upon which the termination decision has to be made? I would like some clarification of those standards upon which the decision maker must rest his or her case in the dismissal of the commission. Could you then go on to the dismissal of the administrator.</PARA></SPEECH>

Section 12 of the act says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The commission shall perform its functions and exercise its power in accordance with such general <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> directions as are given to it by the minister in writing.</PARA>
<PARA>There is a provision of similar character to the provision of section 74. Does that mean that the minister, he or she having given a direction to the commission, can then decide himself or herself whether the commission has failed to take reasonable steps to prevent a contravention of that direction or can decide himself or herself that the commission has intentionally failed to comply with that direction and can thereby dismiss the commission? If that is so, does that not put you into the following position: the minister can give a direction under section 12 or section 74 and then decide himself or herself whether that has been complied with and, if he or she decides it has not been complied with, can dismiss the commission. If that is so, what sort of independence does that give to a commission? What I mean by that is that here we have a commission that, unless it complies with the general directions of a minister given in writing to the satisfaction of the minister who has given that direction, the minister can sack, in effect, without there ever having been any review on the facts.</PARA></SPEECH>

The minister made reference to his second reading speech. My understanding, the last time I looked, or the last time I talked to a judge, is that a court will take account of second reading speeches only when it needs to be guided on the provisions of the law. If a court is absolutely satisfied that the law as printed is clear, the second reading speech of the minister is just so much paper. Perhaps that practice has changed. Courts these days are finding implied rights for freedom of speech in the constitution which I cannot find, so they are more inventive than I am.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take your point, Minister, that we are not talking about sacking the board, but we certainly are talking about disabling it for the period that the administrator is in office. For that reason, this provision concerns me. I will put an extreme hypothetical case of a fraud that has occurred in a regional office of ATSIC. It is beyond dispute that fraud has occurred. It involves, say, a million dollars, which triggers the minister's requirement to be satisfied. I guess it is a matter for political or moral judgment as to whether it is major fraud; nevertheless, fraud has occurred and the minister has acted lawfully by appointing an administrator.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of an appeal to the judicial review process, surely it would be very difficult to get a court to overturn that decision, even if, on the reasonable judgment of somebody standing outside the process, the matter were confined to one office and not systemic in the organisation. Providing a fraud had occurred and the proposed provision complied with&mdash;there is no reference in this provision to `major' or `extreme' fraud&mdash;the legislation is satisfied.

<PARA>All honourable senators will be very familiar with those provisions&mdash;because they do, in fact, apply to us. They must be fairly common around the Commonwealth of Australia. They certainly were the provisions that applied when I was a member of the Northern Territory parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Importantly, the committee should note that it is not a question of being actually sentenced to 12 months that triggers this disqualification. It is being convicted of an offence which is punishable by a sentence of 12 months or longer. I do not resile from the fact that, in that sense, it is a tough provision. It is an appropriate condition that is certainly placed on the tenure of members of parliament, and it is not unreasonable to have it placed on members of the ATSIC board. Paragraph (3) reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subsection (2) does not disqualify a person from being appointed as a Commissioner if the Federal Court of Australia, on application by the person, declares that in spite of the person's conviction, he or she ought not to be disqualified from being appointed as a Commissioner.</PARA>
<PARA>It simply, explicitly, puts in there that there will be a check and balance&mdash;there will be an opportunity for the person to have their day in court if they feel they have been unfairly dealt with. But it is, in my respectful submission, a tougher provision than the one proposed and, in that sense, should be.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;IWe are opposing these provisions. They are the heart of the bill in respect of all the provisions for the appointment of an administrator to the commission. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> I have certainly gone over in some length the reasons for the opposition not supporting these provisions. I take this opportunity to again make it absolutely clear that we are as one with the government, the Greens, the Australian Democrats and everybody else about the need for the strictest requirements of accountability in respect of ATSIC as an association.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that the point I am about to make has been made by other senators. These points were made by me in the committee, but I also want to make them here. There is one thing I find objectionable about these provisions and the appointment of the special auditor. These two things are related, as the minister knows full well; we discussed this at some length in the committee when we were discussing the provisions of this bill on Friday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I heard evidence on Friday and I have heard an enormous amount of evidence over the last few days. I was also faxed this afternoon by a lawyer in Darwin the minutes of a meeting held in Darwin to deal with social security matters. That meeting dealt with the effect that the appointment of a special auditor would have on the operations of ATSIC bodies right across Australia. As a result of all this evidence, I am far from satisfied that sufficient attention was given to this matter by the government and the minister, although I concede that it may well have been out of his hands. I was a member of cabinet and government for quite a number of years. Nevertheless, the minister is responsible both in a real sense and in here for the legislation that goes through in respect of Aboriginal affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One thing that provides for that concern is the sheer timing of these proposals, the appointment of the special auditor and the minister's own evidence to the committee last Friday. I am sure that he can recall it. That evidence is that he was aware of ATSIC's concerns about having gone through all this accountability stuff which would eventually lead, in the worst possible case, to the appointment of an administrator to replace the board. He had heard from the commissioner as to their concerns about the lack of action that subsequently followed references from <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2281"> the Fraud Awareness Unit after investigations by the Office of Evaluation and Audit. I think I am accurately paraphrasing his words. He had attempted to pursue this matter and had been unable to get a clear answer as to why none of this had happened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The concerns I had that the simple physical lapse of time did not allow for it were fairly firmly set in place by the minister's own words. I said last Friday that I felt that, rather than putting out press releases accusing other people of being negligent, the minister and, in a corporate sense, the government were negligent in simply saying, `Can't give you a satisfactory answer to that,' and then rushing off to a press conference to announce that the only solution was to have an administrator, for the administrator to be able to disable the entire board for fraud&mdash;it is all up in lights; we are going to make it squeaky clean again&mdash;and to appoint a special auditor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of the special auditor, I can tell the minister right here and now, because of the correspondence I have had in the last hour, confusion still reigns supreme. While the lawyers are here&mdash;and the appointment of the administrator and the appointment of the special auditor are related, as we acknowledged last Friday&mdash;perhaps the minister can explain something that puzzles me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister issued directions, which I as a non-lawyer have read, to the board under section 12 of this act rather than under the other section&mdash;I think it is section 74, from memory&mdash;that enables the minister to issue directions in respect of financial matters to the board. The first paragraph of those directions to the board says, from memory&mdash;and stop me when I am wrong&mdash;that `you will not disburse any further money to anybody until you get a certificate from the special auditor' or words to that effect, and there is a three-week time lapse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My understanding of that as a non-lawyer is that the clock takes over completely at that point. This may be something the minister can clarify now. My understanding of that provision, in respect of having a clean&hyphen;up for fraud, is that if the special auditor fails to complete the audit in the first paragraph of the minister's direction within the allotted three <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> weeks, the audit is simply not completed.

I assume that has been put in there for the very proper reason that the government did not want the affairs of ATSIC to be disabled for an inordinate period of time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But&mdash;and this is the point I wanted cleared up now and this is a little more complicated&mdash;in the instructions for the special auditor, which I have also read and they were widely circulated, there is a reference to a short&hyphen;cut audit for organisations that might need a bit of help to get them across the line. The reason I am asking the question&mdash;and I am sure it is obvious to the advisers&mdash;is that this is where the problem has occurred, if it has occurred, with the letter that was sent from the ATSIC office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From my own non-legal reading of the ATSIC letter, that ATSIC letter seemed to be a totally accurate reflection of the black-letter provisions that I had read in your directions and in the instruction manual that was issued. The instruction manual did have a section in it dealing with an expedited process for the audit&mdash;if you like, a quick audit, a preliminary audit&mdash;but, nevertheless, the audit, as preliminary as it might be, had to be done; it could not simply be circumvented. That was consistent with what was contained in the letter from the ATSIC office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There might be a brilliant opportunity here to clear up this entire confusion for everybody's sake. They are listening to what we are saying at the moment. There might not be a whole heap of them, but I know at least 10 or 15 people are listening. Do you understand the problem, Minister? The instructions talk about an expedited audit, but the audit, nevertheless, has to happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also noted in another section that the minister also has an overriding power under <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2282"> certain circumstances to step in himself, which is probably what this association in Western Australia was hoping he would do. But the understanding on the ground at the ATSIC regional level is that, before this expedited process can be triggered, there has to be at least a clearance, however quick it is, by the special auditor before they are empowered to issue one dollar of funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, you do have an opportunity now to clear this up for once and for all. I am assured by everybody that I have spoken to that their interpretation of what they have been given&mdash;and they have been given the minister's direction and the instruction manual&mdash;is that, fundamentally, the content of that letter is accurate.</PARA>

I said that today in question time, as the minister would recall.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They relayed that back to the ATSIC office and the ATSIC office said&mdash;I believe in good faith&mdash;`That may well be so, but that is not what we have got in front of us here. What we have got in front of us here is the instruction manual and the minister's direction.' They would also have had advice from head office I would strongly suspect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know quite a number of ATSIC bureaucrats, and I think the particular individual is quite a senior one. I do not know him personally, but I understand he is from the Perth head office and he is there temporarily because of the problem the minister alluded to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the other day.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He said to Junjuwa, `Yes, there are expedited processes, but they cannot even be triggered until the special auditor has given, under the instruction manual, the quick clearance which we are all hoping will be given. I cannot give you an offer until at least that happens. There is nothing, consistent with the minister's directions that empowers me to do that.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where I am getting to legally, and I am only a bush lawyer, is that it is seems to me that unless there is a piece of paper that allows you to simply hand out $300,000, that action would be utterly in breach of the first paragraph of your directions.

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VW4">Senator HERRON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will give you the definitive answer. There are numerous examples of services essential to indigenous communities which are provided by organisations funded under ATSIC or TSRA programs such as water provisions, sewerage and drainage services, electricity provisions and employment. Often CDEP is the sole source of community income, as you well know. Because of that, strengthened accountability is even more important for basic services such as these.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2283">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The transitional arrangements provide for essential services, without a history of significant breaches, to be funded immediately. The government expects that ATSIC or TSRA will only propose grants to organisations that are fit and proper. I am sure you would support that. The minister will not be disposed to allow grants or loans to bodies not fit and proper except in the most exceptional circumstances and where a satisfactory ratification strategy is in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Relevant exceptional circumstances may be where, for instance, an organisation provides essential services where there is no alternative provider and where substantial restructuring of the organisation, together with an administrator or grant controller, is agreed. The major focus should remain on the bona fides of the organisation concerned and whether sufficient remedial action to develop an alternate provider or to rectify the providers organisational problems have been put in place by ATSIC or TSRA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe that any Australian, indigenous or otherwise, would want ATSIC or TSRA to make grants to organisations found not fit and proper to receive public moneys. The major emphasis is on bringing poorly performing organisations up to speed or developing alternative providers who will be accountable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In regard to those transitional arrangements, in order to minimise the possibility of delay in the payment of grants or loans to organisations which are not in breach of grants conditions, the government decided that transitional arrangements should be put in place to speed up the decisions relating to lower risk organisations. These arrangements provide that those organisations categorised by ATSIC or TSRA as having no current breach of grant conditions and no other significantly adverse history will not be required to be scrutinised by the special auditor for their July grants. I think that clarifies it completely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The relevant financial information will still need to be provided and the organisation will be subject to special auditor scrutiny by 1 October 1996 and will be provided funds pro rata up to a limit of $300,000 per grant or loan. In other words, those organisations <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which have abided by the accountability requirements in the past should be under no risk of any delays in their upcoming grants. That is what I referred to in question time.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA>I will speak to the amendments together and they can be voted on separately. They all relate to removing references to prison penalties within the act and substituting the appropriate penalty units. There is no diminution in the range of discretion that is given, but there is a principle being applied and, as many senators will be well aware, this is consistent with a campaign that I have been conducting in relation to the Social Security Act and also in any other bills that come to my attention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason for that is to support the principle that prison should be a penalty of last resort, and that our commitment to that principle should not be simply nominal. In <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> particular, I believe that we have a case in point, that the offences here are serious ones. There is no question about that. But the question as to what is the most appropriate penalty can be answered with almost complete certainty that prison should not be used as a first resort, which is what is implied, and it has been stated in this way in the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should be up to the court to determine the appropriate penalties. To have penalty units means that there is a range of sanctions and penalties that the court can apply. We should be particularly concerned about this when discussing the ATSIC bills, because recommendation No. 92 of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody strongly urges that imprisonment be applied only as a penalty of last resort. I believe we need to have a much stronger response in the area of Aboriginal over&hyphen;representation in prison. We need to look at the way in which prison is used in a coercive and threatening way if we are going to keep putting it as though it has a deterrent effect when criminologists know that that is not the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that it would be beneficial to remove the reference to imprisonment and put the penalty unit equivalents in support of that principle that we should not be implying prison has some kind of magic value by being mentioned in the act. We should certainly be supporting the idea that the penalty should fit the crime and the offence, and that should be left up to the appropriate court determination. That is why I would urge my colleagues to support these amendments. I already know that I am unlikely to get that support, but I want to just put that on the record.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to clarify my position. I understand what Senator Kernot is saying, but my understanding is that using the term `penalty units' does not preclude a prison penalty being given. It actually allows either a prison penalty of the same amount that is in the act or a fine. In my view it takes that connotation of imprisonment as a threat of first resort out of the bill. So to my knowledge it does not change the penalties which may be applied or the discretion that is available to the court. Instead, it starts to produce a climate committed to removing prison as a threat which we have been using over the Aboriginal community for 200 years. That is the reason why I would like to see the measure removed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish it could remove the capacity to imprison people as readily as we do, but it does not do that. It is very nominal in that sense, and in a way it is tokenistic. I would rather say that it is symbolic than tokenistic, because I believe it is time that we started addressing the way in which imprisonment is used in this society. As Senator Kernot has pointed out, for offences concerning voting&mdash;or, in my belief, even if it is a serious offence&mdash;imprisonment is a penalty that should be used to protect the community from danger or to protect an individual from being a danger to himself or herself. It is not to be used simply as a first option in order to enforce a particular discipline. There are many appropriate penalties that may be applied, but we do not exercise them if we can so quickly resort to prison.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Panizza for doing that because it is a helpful way of clarifying what I am saying. I do note that we raised this matter at the committee and it was the minister's response that, because this could as easily apply to non&hyphen;Aboriginal people as Aboriginal people, he did not feel that the recommendation in the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody was relevant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My point stands because it does not matter who is subject to the penalty, whether it be an Aboriginal person or a non-Aboriginal person. I would not want to discriminate. My point is that the punishment should fit the crime and that it is very rare that the punishment of imprisonment actually fits the crime. It has become one of those, I believe, easy recourses that we have used over the years to punish people inappropriately when we could think creatively of better ways of making restitution, such as by counselling, community service and other approaches to restore the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2288"> community, rather than increasing the damage by the very costly&mdash;socially, humanly and economically&mdash;measure of imprisonment. So my point still stands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been using this argument in relation to the Social Security Act where it is again of no relevance. I think I raised this measure in relation to a disabilities work supplement allowance where a disabled person was penalised by a prison penalty for failure to give accurate information. I pointed out how ridiculous it was to have even mentioned in legislation of that kind those kinds of draconian penalties because, if there is serious fraud, the Crimes Act is referred to. Prison penalties are within the Crimes Act. So I do not believe that it is necessary to fill this legislation, which is dealing with much less serious crimes and offences, with the same kind of prison terminology as though we were recreating another crimes act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I could be in error. I will have to plead feebleness of the brain or something in the last two days of the session if I am in error. My understanding was that the ease of converting one year of imprisonment into 50 penalty units was simply that&mdash;that it did not take away that possibility. But I could be wrong and I will seek the guidance of the chamber. In any event I would welcome support from Senator Bob Collins and the Democrats if they were prepared to support at least amendments Nos 2, 5 and 6, on the basis that those amendments are very minor and would not even deserve imprisonment provisions.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to explain to the minister why I am interested in pursuing this matter. I make no bones about it; it is fundamentally for my continuing education and that of all other legislators. We are now confronted with this interesting new term `units' rather than `dollars'. I have been advised, by those who know, that one unit is $100.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Panizza quite correctly made a reference to the sentencing guidelines that judges take into account. What Senator Kernot said astonished me. I am puzzled why we need to have units instead of dollars. This is a serious matter and it will be interesting to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> see what advice we get. If the reason for having units instead of dollars is so that courts will have some discretion to convert the units into prison sentences as well as money, then I am going to run a campaign that is as good as yours, Senator Chamarette, to get this pernicious business of units taken out of legislation and to have dollars put back in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is for a reason, in terms of what I think is a very important relationship between parliaments and courts. I always understood that an important sentencing guideline, as well as the one Senator Panizza mentioned, was that judges are supposed to have some regard to what the legislators&mdash;in their wisdom or stupidity from time to time and who are elected by the people&mdash;think is a reasonable punishment or a reasonable provision in a piece of legislation. If the parliament in its wisdom or stupidity believes that a non-custodial sentence is appropriate and, indeed, by inference, that a custodial sentence is not appropriate&mdash;and I am prepared to be educated; that is why I find this a very interesting point; I have puzzled over this new term `unit', but not enough to lose sleep over it&mdash;if that means that judges can at their discretion send people to gaol&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, they really were the old days. A specific figure, such as a fine for $100, used to be set and the magistrate or the judge could impose a fine of up to $100. But, because of the rage of inflation, the legislature could not keep up with the necessity of going through and changing $10 to $20 and what have you for every crime. So they started defining the penalties in terms of units.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead of having to go right through every act to change the amount that a magistrate or a judge could fine a person for a particular crime, they started using units. So now you simply have to pass one bill that says, `From now on a unit is $100 or $200.' The whole system is kept up to date without going through the fairly onerous task of correcting every particular act. But I am interested in whether people can go to gaol in default of a fine. I would be interested to see what the provision says about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is Senator Chamarette's last day, but two or three, and she ought to be praised. I would like to praise her on this issue of penalties. Imprisonment is too often used and there is a trend to use it more and more. That is a very bad trend. Imprisonment, by and large, does more harm than good to people. Of course there are other factors that have to be taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it has been said that parliament should take part in sentencing. Parliament should take part in sentencing, but only in so far as it sets maximums.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, we are dealing with two bills&mdash;the Customs Amendment Bill 1996 and the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No.1) 1996&mdash;which are being debated together. The opposition supports the first bill, the Customs Amendment Bill 1996, but we oppose the second, the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No.1) 1996.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take this opportunity to foreshadow that at the conclusion of the debate on the second reading I will move a motion which, if carried, will require the second bill to be withdrawn and recast. I recognise that that is quite a drastic step, but we take it for an important reason, and that is that the government, by virtue of this bill, breaks a most solemn election promise and seeks to impose a goods and services tax by stealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Acting Deputy President, you will recall that at the federal election the then opposition, in the person of the then shadow Treasurer and now Treasurer, Mr Peter Costello, made a promise. That promise was: no new taxes. This bill unmistakably and unavoidably imposes new taxes, and it does so on consumers and industry inputs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both these bills deal with tariff concession orders. The situation under the current law is that when no producer in Australia produces a good, that good can be imported into the country without tariff if it obtains a tariff concession. Where there is negligible manufacture or production of a good in Australia, that good can still be imported because it is held not to compete unfairly with Australian production.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first of these two bills is a bill that we produced when we were in government, that is, the Customs Amendment Bill. The origin of this bill was the innovation statement. The innovation statement was announced by the then Prime Minister in early December last year and was a major industry policy initiative by the previous government. It served a very valuable purpose in promoting Australian industrial production and, in particular, in finding a bridge between the creativeness of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australian scientists and their ability to commercialise their scientific ideas in Australia rather than seeing them go overseas and be commercialised by foreigners. Regretfully, it appears that the majority of the measures announced in the innovation statement by the former government to enable that to occur will now be set aside. That is not the debate here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the measures that we announced in the innovation statement was to remove the provision in the customs tariff concession order system in which, if there is only an insignificant producer, the foreign good can come into Australia without a tariff having to be paid. The first of these bills, the Customs Amendment Bill, holds true to that view and removes the market test. It makes other consequential changes. As well, it tightens the project status under the bill to the extent of projects over $120 million and is a bill that was widely hailed at the time it was announced by industry. It is, of course, supported by the opposition. It is a sensible measure and one which I think improves the functioning of the act and does not unfairly expose Australian industry to foreign competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That brings me to the bill that we oppose, the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill. The `GST by Stealth Bill' would be its better name. This bill is an extraordinary thing. As I said in my introductory remarks, it breaks a solemn election undertaking that there would be no new taxes. This is the third time in the short history of this government that that promise&mdash;so soberly and purposefully delivered to the Australian electorate&mdash;is to be broken. This bill imposes a three per cent tariff on imports which do not attract duty now or which, because the first bill is passed, by virtue of the passage of the first bill, will not attract duty. That is to say, the cost of those goods imported into Australia in the hands of the importers will cost three per cent more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If those importers are wholesale companies, then of course one expects they will pass on that cost in the final product and retailers, in turn, will also pass that cost on to consumers. No&hyphen;one imagines that it will not be passed on. Indeed, the wry and cynical view of many <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2292"> consumers is that those costs are passed on, usually with a few extra costs as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this bill the government also proposes to impose a three per cent cost on goods imported directly that go to the consumer market, whether they pass through the hands of an Australian manufacturer as a component in a completed good, or whether they come in and go to the market directly. That three per cent will, of course, be directly passed on. It is idle for the government to pretend it will not. It is wrong for the government to say, `This is not a tax; it is a tariff.' The government knows that, but the government also knows that if it tells the truth on this subject then it will be convicted, in its own terms, of breaking its own election promises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The three per cent on imports is, as I have said, an astonishing and amazing thing. Mr Simon Crean, my colleague in the other place, sought from the minister there a list of these consumer goods and met a blank wall. Senator Chris Schacht, my colleague in this place, put a question on notice which led to the minister, Mr Geoff Prosser, providing a list of goods that might fall into the definition of consumer goods; and he has now made that available. I understand, if it has not already been done, it will be provided as an answer to Senator Schacht's question by the minister handling this bill tonight, Senator Parer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The advice from Mr Prosser is extraordinary. It does not say that there are 20 consumer items that will be taxed, nor 100, nor 500. There will be 23,000 consumer items which will be taxed under this provision as it now stands and Mr Prosser's advice to my colleague Senator Schacht contains a sample of 2,600 items that have been provided by the minister.</PARA>

Jigsaws will be taxed by three per cent; children's safety and hygiene products will be taxed by that amount; heat&hyphen;resistant ovenware will be taxed by three per cent; basketball nets and Christmas stockings will be taxed by that amount; sporting footwear will be so taxed; babies' bottles will be taxed that way as well; hair accessories will be taxed that way; and if you are a musician, many musical instruments will be taxed, including percussion musical instruments and speaker systems. The list goes on; it is a long list. This is unquestionably and unarguably a GST by stealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The impact of these measures on Australian manufacturers will be to push up their costs and, where they supply the domestic market, they will pass those costs on&mdash;and that will add to inflation in this country. Where those Australian manufacturers import foreign components that would come in duty free, because of this bill they will have to pay an extra three per cent to import those components. So, if they sell their completed product on the international market, the cost to their customers in that market will reflect the three per cent that the imported component part of their finished good represents. That will also mean a higher cost for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are matters of which consumers should be aware, and these are matters of grave concern to the opposition. For some time we have sought information on these items. It is gratifying that at last it has arrived, and in time for this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said at the beginning of my remarks, the opposition made a solemn election undertaking. Let me recite to the Senate the words <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2293"> of the now Treasurer, Mr Costello, at the National Press Club last year before the election when he gave the undertaking to which I refer:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But what I am saying here is, we'll not be hiking the income tax rates or company tax rates or sales tax rates or extending the sales tax in any way that the government is proposing. That is not our agenda. It is not our agenda to introduce new taxes. It is not our agenda to bulk up the currently existing taxes. That's not our agenda.</PARA>
<PARA>There cannot be any clearer expression of view than that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the third breach by the government of that undertaking. The first breach occurred when it introduced legislation to wipe out the travel exemption provision for building workers in this country. It pretended that this meant that building workers would be treated the same as everyone else, when, of course, the occupation of a construction worker is different from every other occupation. Construction workers are required to start work at different locations depending on where their construction site is and, when they complete their work, to move to another location. For those reasons the exemption was preferred. Very few other workers are in a similar situation. But it is not for me now to argue the merits or otherwise of it because what nakedly is the case here is that a tax that did not exist before was imposed and that measure raises a new tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second breach concerned the wholesale sales tax on motor vehicles. I will not canvass in this chamber again the debacle of the COAG meeting in which the state premiers rolled the Treasurer to a large extent. But senators will recall the debacle during the last two&hyphen;week break in Senate business and the final decision in which it was announced that $1 billion or more would be raised by pursuing the sales tax on motor vehicles. That caused the New South Wales government to say that its share of the cost was $900 million per annum or $100 per household and that it would seek to retrieve the costs that the Commonwealth had imposed on it by raising taxes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Queensland the cost is $190 million per annum and state taxes and charges will rise to compensate. In Victoria the cost is $600 <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> million per annum. I think Premier Kennett has announced that he will keep the levy of $100 per annum on households in order to recoup that amount. In my own state of Western Australia the cost is $91 million. The state government says that it will absorb that amount by cutting out programs that exist and finding other efficiencies. It says that because there is an election in February in Western Australia and no government would hike taxes before an election. But if they are returned, you watch them. Taxes will go up and of that there is no doubt. So the second breach of the solemn undertaking concerns the outcome of the premiers conference and the impositions on the states which will cause the states to recover their position through taxes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third breach is this bill that we are considering this afternoon, the bill that ought properly be called `the GST consumption tax by stealth bill'&mdash;a tax on 23,000 items. No wonder that in briefings to my colleague Mr Crean, Customs officials have called this a tax bill. No wonder the National Farmers Federation call it a tax. It is not surprising that industry also refer to it as a tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate will know that the High Court has in the past defined a tariff as a tax. The government pretends this is not a tax. As I said, Mr Costello knows that if he tells the truth on this he will be found out that he has broken a promise. But not all of his colleagues are so reticent about calling a spade a spade. One of his ministerial colleagues, the Minister for Science and Technology, Mr Moore, on April 12 this year said that it was `totally correct' to say that the removal of tariff concession orders was an extra tax on business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The revenue measure that this new tax is hoping to gain is $100 million per annum. I will not delay the Senate by reminding the government at great length of all the remarks they made about the so&hyphen;called l&hyphen;a&hyphen;w law guarantee of the former Prime Minister but if they believe one whit of what they said then, they ought to be absolutely embarrassed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also know that this pushes up inflation and that unions in a strong bargaining position will recover their position but workers in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2294"> a poor bargaining position will not. They will have to bear the burden of the extra charges. Those on fixed incomes and pensions will not be able to recover their position, either. This is universally seen for what it is: a tax. It has been called dreadful policy by John Moore, the industry minister, in briefings to industry groups. On that he is right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will be moving the amendment to which I referred at the end of the second reading stage to ensure that we require the government to go back and re&hyphen;examine what it has done, to cast this so that the effect does not fall on the consumer and to do it in a way in which, if they possibly can&mdash;I cannot see how they can, but at least they ought to be made to try&mdash;they can honour the election undertakings they have given.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After the first 100 days of this government there appeared in many newspapers and periodicals an assessment of their achievement. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, the Friday before the 100 days expired, had a snapshot of the achievements of various ministers. Against the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, Mr Moore, it said that his achievement was that he rolled the Treasurer, Mr Costello, in cabinet on this issue. The intention had been to impose five per cent on imported goods for industry. The achievement of Mr Moore was to ensure that that was three per cent on industry and three per cent on consumers.</PARA>

<TIME.STAMP>(6.32 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate tonight is debating two bills cognately, the Customs Amendment Bill 1996 and the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1996. The first bill is one that the Australian Democrats will support. It is designed to revamp and streamline the administration of the policy by&hyphen;law system and, generally, to reform the tariff concession system to ensure that Australian industries are protected and advanced in their efforts to maintain jobs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill seeks to remove the market test from the core criteria. It will leave substitutability as the sole criterion for determining whether a concession will be granted. Clearly, this will provide additional protection for Australian manufacturers by making it more difficult for importers to obtain concessions. In particular, it will remove the scope for importers to obtain the concession on the grounds that it will not significantly adversely affect Australian manufacturers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats believe that it is important to remove this test because of the difficulty faced by Australian manufacturers in showing that markets for its goods will be adversely affected. The only core criterion that will thus remain is the substitutability test which will ensure that concessions will be available only where there is no domestic manufacturer of a substitutable good. We agree that the honours for demonstrating that there are no substitutable goods produced in Australia should rest with the prospective importer, not with manufacturers. This part of the bill will remove a considerable burden from industry. Overall, the Democrats believe that this bill introduces changes which, while tightening up the tariff concession system, enhance it and improve the assistance it provides to Australian manufacturers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2295"> I turn to the second bill, the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1996. It is interesting to note that the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, Mr John Moore, said that it was dreadful policy. It was proposed by both the ALP and the coalition during the election campaign and very clearly was designed to raise revenue. But like so many other measures that this government is seeking to introduce in response to pressure from the Treas ury and finance departments, it bears little resemblance to a carefully constructed policy based on what effects the moves to gain revenue will have. It runs counter to many statements that have been made by industry leaders and also by authoritative bodies that have looked at the effectiveness of the tariff concession scheme. In a 1991 inquiry, the Industry Commission found:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No case for terminating a tariff concession system which alleviates taxes on production inputs and on other goods in a wide area of economic activity.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>That report identified lower consumer prices and higher national income as the result of these tariff concessions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government backed down on the initial proposal to impose a five per cent tariff after a tremendous outcry by Australian industries along with Queensland and Western Australian government backbenchers. Thus, we have the present bill, which is a compromise that really satisfies no-one. The effect will be to apply in substance a three per cent tariff where previously there was none.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As has already been stated by Senator Cook, this is a breach of an election promise. Despite government claims to the contrary, a tariff is, in effect, a tax. The industry minister, the Hon. John Moore, has admitted this. It is a three per cent tax on both consumers and industry and therefore on jobs. Let us make no mistake: if we load additional costs on our manufacturers and industries, it will mean that they will be less competitive in domestic and international markets. Their market share and sales will drop. Jobs will disappear and unemployment will rise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the net effect of this bill which the government has brought to this chamber. One wonders what the policy substance of the bill is. What considerations lead to a bill which will demonstrably mean the loss of Australian jobs? It is also a backdoor GST, as has already been said in this chamber. Ordinary household consumers will be hit by price rises to a large identified raft of imported goods. Some of the items which will be hit include television sets, microwaves, vacuum cleaners, children's toys, playground equipment and neonatal equipment.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats believe that this very clearly is in breach of the government's promise not to introduce a new tax. The Democrats will therefore attempt to exclude this section. I understand that the ALP opposition is considering opposing this section of the bill. The Democrats are of a mind to support the opposition. However, we are also mindful of the government's need to raise revenue. We will therefore suggest to the government that&mdash;I have communicated this to the minister, the Hon. John Moore, this morning&mdash;if it wishes to separate luxury goods from necessity of life items in the list of consumer items, the Democrats would be quite prepared to accept the three per cent tax on luxury items.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very clear that the sole purpose of this bill is to raise budget savings. Very clearly, it is not good industry policy. I have already said this and I will say it again: to the Australian Democrats, that part of the bill which imposes a three per cent tax on components which go into Australian products for both domestic and international markets and on capital equipment which our industries have to buy is by far the worst part of this bill. It will very clearly and quite demonstrably cost Australian jobs. Once again, one needs to ask: what is the thinking behind this bill put by the government whereby, at a time when our unemployment is trending towards 10 per cent, it is happy to introduce a bill that will hamper our industries, make it harder for them to compete and make it necessary for them to reduce the labour force and throw people onto the scrap heap?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australian manufacturing is already suffering. A survey undertaken this month by the Australian Business Chamber and the State Bank of Manufacturers in New South Wales found that for the sixth consecutive quarter the main indicators of production, sales, orders and profitability have weakened and that manufacturers have more than doubled the number of jobs they intend to shed over the next 12 months. Extrapolating the figures for New South Wales nationally, this suggests that overall job losses in manufacturing could be well over 12,000.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2296">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will merely exacerbate the present situation and result in a further reduction in domestic manufacturing and an increase in unemployment. So much for the government's commitment to help small business. It will simply make life more difficult for many of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government may well argue that this measure will not cause excessive pain to Australian industry and that a shift in the dollar has more impact on Australian industry than this change to the tariff concession system. But this simply ignores the fact that every percentage point of input costs matters and that, unlike changes in the value of the dollar, we do have control over whether we introduce this measure. This government is quite intentionally and deliberately introducing a measure that will harm industries and cost jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is concerned to increase revenue. It is talking about the $8 billion black hole. We already know that the $8 billion black hole has been based on the extremely rubbery concept of economic growth forecasts, which have already been shown to improve, and that the $8 billion is no longer $8 billion. Be that as it may, the Democrats understand that the government wishes to increase revenue and reduce the deficit. It is a policy that we do not oppose. But we call on the government to give some thought as to where they cut and to consider the consequences of whichever cuts are imposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that the government should not automatically follow the Treasury line. Indeed, I quote once again the industry minister, the Hon. John Moore, who himself has attacked this monopoly of advice which is coming from Finance and Treasury:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The conventional wisdom, the views propagated by those two departments, are virtually unquestioned.</PARA>
<PARA>I quote the Hon. John Moore:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think it is very unhealthy that you just have this Treasury line. I am saying they are not always right.</PARA>
<PARA>Too right, they are not always right.</PARA>
<PARA>Only the other day, on 17 June, it was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>  that the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> minister believes that the government's unilateral tariff reduction program may have progressed too quickly and been too far in advance on nearby countries. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think some of the past negotiations on APEC . . . have been a bit like the Dance of the Seven Veils, in which Australia has been getting them off and nobody else has.</PARA>
<PARA>That is certainly well and truly on record. Apart from New Zealand, Australia is the country that has been pursuing tariff cuts with the greatest alacrity. Our tariff bindings under the WTO agreement represent a commitment not to increase tariffs above certain levels, except by negotiation and with compensation for affected trading partners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, following the GATT Uruguay Round, Australia's commitments involved achieving an average tariff cut of 44 per cent relative to 1986-87, with an average final bound tariff of 10.9 per cent. However, the Australian government has announced a program of tariff reductions well in excess of that commitment involving a reduction in average tariffs of 70 per cent and a simple average tariff of 6.3 per cent in 1996-97.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government wants extra revenue, revenue that will not harm our industries, revenue that will not increase unemployment and not cost Australians jobs, the Australian Democrats are happy to give the government an out, to give the government an avenue where it can raise additional revenue. All it needs to do is to slow down the tariff cuts by 12 months and collect $700 million. It is very simple.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is possible to do that well within the obligations that we have under WTO. It will not harm our industries; it will benefit our industries. It will give the government $700 million. We are prepared to move that amendment during the committee stage and we will challenge the government to accept it. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>I am speaking today to the compliance report on ILO instruments adopted in 1995. Most of the report is in French. There is a background and summary at the front of the terms of Australia's compliance. I think the part of the report that is in French mainly relates to the protocol and the document itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some interesting points in the report that we should take note of. A summary of the provisions of the new instruments are outlined, but Australia's position in this regard is perhaps the most interesting. There is recognition of the position of mining in Australia. In relation to safety and health in mines, it points out that the Commonwealth has no jurisdiction over the subject matter addressed by the convention and the recommendation. Point 18 in this report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following a preliminary examination of law and practice, at least two States (Western Australia and South Australia) consider that there is compliance with the Convention. Legal confirmation of these opinions will be sought before these Governments formulate a view concerning ratification of the Convention.</PARA>
<PARA>There are two governments that consider that they comply with the convention, but that has to be checked. Point 19 in the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Queensland currently has compliance difficulties, but is developing new legislation. The implementation of the coal mining legislation has been delayed, due to the possibility of changes resulting from the recommendations of the Mining Warden's Enquiry into the fatalities at Moura No 2 Mine in August 1994. Queensland should comply with the Convention once the new legislation is developed and brought into force.</PARA>
<PARA>One of the lessons learnt from the dreadful incident at Moura is that it was considered a right of the workers at Moura to have access to information about their own safety. That  <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2298"> included access to information about whether or not their lives were in jeopardy and whether or not particular actions and particular safety regimes, or lack thereof, did, at any time, put their lives in jeopardy. I notice that the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Parer) is deep in discussion at the moment, but probably not about this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point we were trying to make most decisively in relation to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Griffin Venture</EMPHASIS> is that it is vitally important and a basic right of workers to know whether the actions of the company they are employed by, especially if their place of employment is a floating petroleum platform off the coast of Australia, are placing their lives in jeopardy. I am very distressed to find that that has not been dealt with in relation to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Griffin Venture</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are indications that the Australian Capital Territory does not think the convention is applicable to it. There are not a great many mines in the ACT. Other jurisdictions have identified compliance problems. The fact is that Western Australia and South Australia consider they comply, the ACT considers it is exempt, Queensland has some problems and the other states and territories have compliance problems. There is still a long way to go in terms of occupational health and safety in mines in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that the work done in relation to this ILO convention will assist with that. We ought to remember when developing any new mining operation or with any commercial push for world competitive prices that we do not go down the  track of putting any conditions which deal with basic workplace safety at risk.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the interruption I was speaking about the offer that we are making to the government to get additional revenue, far in excess of that which they are seeking with <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this destructive bill. It will be destructive to employment and Australian industries. Before I return to that point, I wish to emphasise that, while the Democrats do not oppose the second reading amendment moved by the opposition, we will be moving an amendment to it adding our concerns about the damage the government's legislation would do to Australian industries and employment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite clear that the government has another avenue to consider and I believe it should consider it carefully. Numerous industry groups have in fact called on the government to adopt such a policy. It seems that the government refuses to listen. Questioning tariff reductions remains taboo with the economic rationalists who seem to control the debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ironically, in this particular case, the government is introducing a new tariff, but will not consider even temporarily pausing scheduled reductions in existing tariffs even though Australian industry has warned it that the measure is harmful&mdash;and that is very obvious&mdash;and that some relief in the tariff reduction program&mdash;which is not necessary and which is not matched by our trading partners&mdash;would improve Australia's economic position immeasurably. The general tariff rate is set to go down from about seven or eight per cent to five per cent on 1 July 1996. The tariff for the textile, clothing and footwear industry is set to go down by two to three per cent on 1 July 1996. The tariff for the motor vehicle industry is set to go down from 25 to 22.5 per cent on 1 January 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have already said, these reductions are not necessary under our WTO obligations. One keeps wondering why the government is persisting in disadvantaging our industries, causing them to lose jobs, while our competitors, our trading partners, are protecting theirs.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) is designed primarily to increase the concessional tariff rate from zero per cent to three per cent, and for the Greens (WA) this is a somewhat vexatious issue. On one hand, a fairly purist or theoretical position, we see the establishment of concessional rates as working against the establishment of industries in Australia. If any good that is not produced in Australia&mdash;or where a similar good is not produced in Australia&mdash;is granted a total exemption from tariff, why should any producer wish to locate in Australia, aside from the fact that it is a beautiful country with a good climate and a remnant of a decent social system? Basically, there is no economic incentive to do so, unless the market is big enough to be attractive, and other factors such as proximity to that market, or length of transport lines, provide important competitive factors.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The argument is that, if there is a tariff on these goods, it allows the development of industries in these areas. It allows new enterprises to somewhat lower the barriers to market entry. The Greens do not see such a measure as protective, but rather as a mecha nism to promote development. It is our assessment that in many cases where the market is big enough, or where there are other general factors, industry has no reason not to site here, particularly since by siting here it immediately ends the situation under which the concession is offered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people for whom it may be important are probably not the mass market suppliers, but rather the specialty market, technical market or niche market suppliers. These may not have a lot of start up capital, but some pre-existing advantage may assist them. They can go to the banks or potential customers with price advantages and try to get support for establishing an industry without having to establish it first, then having to go through measures to knock out the concession, and then trying to build their market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the largest suppliers, we would have to say that many of them would take advantage of the potential to eliminate the concession and create an advantage, but they do not do so because they have global marketing plans and siting in Australia is not included in them. It is not a purely economic decision&mdash;it is strategic decision&mdash;to site elsewhere and export tariff free to Australia. This begins to raise some of the `real ekonomic' considerations that create an `on the other hand' point of view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that we live in a highly integrated global economy. Large economic interests map out overall international strategies and have considerable interlocking with other businesses who are either supplier companies or provide alternative markets. Many smaller high&hyphen;tech companies have contracts linking them with a few large corporations or conglomerate buyers, and are effectively satellite companies. For example, many of the new developments or niche products are made for IBM by independent small businesses, although they are highly dependent on IBM. In terms of global corporate strategy, Australia has not been chosen as a national site for development of high value added products, but is rather a producer of raw materials. What higher value industries have arisen here are usually the outcome of development of Australian&hyphen;owned small <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2300"> businesses. While there may be computer assembly businesses here, many components are controlled by a few big producers and made elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In such a situation, the introduction of a three per cent tariff on goods not produced here is not likely to have much effect on investment patterns at all. Really, it is other factors in most cases that dictate whether companies locate here or not. Most of our high-tech businesses arose because they were started by Australians who wanted to continue to live in their own country. It was not the pre&hyphen;existence of a tariff that encouraged their investment here, although such a tariff may make the job of establishment a bit more easy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the existence or non-existence of a zero concessional tariff rate which would disappear if a company started up here does not make much difference to investment, what other effects does it have? One thing it does do is make inputs to industry a little cheaper. Where it does not damage development of Australian products and promotes imports, this is a good thing, whether the industry produces for export or the domestic market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also said that it may make consumer costs less, though I think this is a bit more dubious. It could, if the differential is passed on to consumers rather than used to increase profit margins, but the relationship between costs of inputs to manufacturers, costs to distributors or wholesalers and the cost to final consumers is not clear cut. For inputs to a final product, it certainly would have the effect of reducing production costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In any case, when there are cost increases, sellers do not usually hesitate to pass them on, and a three per cent increase on the import price is not a major increase per unit. Obviously, a $100 import product would cost $103. If it were directly resold to a consumer at a 100 per cent mark&hyphen;up, the consumer would pay $203 rather than $200&mdash;though I could not guarantee that this is the way people mark up. This would probably not be large enough to change your decision to buy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Often the mark-up would be higher from import to retail sale. When the increase is on a capital good in manufacture and the in crease is distributed over the goods produced, the effect of the tariff on the price to the consumer ought, in most cases, to be negligible. The issue is mainly of concern for production inputs, where cost differences may be more critical.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question then is whether the impact of raising production costs by increasing the tariff on goods when there is no comparable Australian product outweighs the impact of rises in market entry barriers. In that context, it is worth pointing out that over half the tariff concession usage is for capital equipment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an evolving debate. A few days ago, all parties were apparently debating this internally. At this point, I indicate that the Greens support the opposition's second reading amendment. We believe that this is effectively a kind of consumption tax, generally referred to as a producer tax. In other words, it taxes the other end of the spectrum from retail sales taxes and at a stage prior to Australia's wholesale sales taxes. As such, it not only has the regressive attributes of a consumption tax, adding to the cost of goods to eventual consumers; it also has an adverse impact on exports. It does this, as the amendment says, without actually promoting the development of Australian industry. In fact, by negatively impacting on the cost of domestic production, it works against the development of Australian domestic and export industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We support the notion that this impost on production should be taken away. There are better and more progressive means of raising revenue. One such means, often put forward by the Greens, is the establishment of a lower limit&mdash;a minimum below which company taxes cannot be reduced. Company tax as we know is 36 per cent, yet many companies pay far less&mdash;often levels less than five per cent. I sometimes wonder whether some companies expect that the community ought to be paying them. We suggest at least a billion dollars is to be gained by setting the company tax level at 20 per cent and making it a level below which companies cannot further minimise their tax.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2301">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also the issue of the loopholes identified by Treasury which are used by the top 80 or so taxpayers. It was foreshadowed that closing these loopholes would bring in over half a billion dollars annually. I suggest that these are areas for increasing revenue which should be used long before we create negative impacts on industry that will flow on in a regressive fashion to consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have pointed out is not simple to explain, because we are not talking about a simple issue. That is why it is clear that there was obviously a lot of discussion within all parties involved. There was certainly the same kind of to&hyphen;and&hyphen;fro discussion within our own office when we talked through the issues and looked at the various case scenarios which we have dealt with. I do believe that in this case there is a necessity to go back to the drawing board and look at the basis upon which the legislation was drafted to see what it is hoping to achieve. I think that is really important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are setting a tariff or a tax&mdash;but in particular a tariff&mdash;usually there is an industry basis to it. You would ask, `What are we hoping to achieve from this?' If it is just a revenue measure, you would not use a tariff. You use a tariff for a particular industry outcome, and you make sure that is what the tariff will achieve. In this case, I believe that what has been presented is not as clear as it should be. Therefore, it is misrepresenting itself as a tariff when it is, in fact, a form of consumption tax.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would also like to say a few words about this government&mdash;the `no new tax' government with its big list of new tax items. There is a list of items to be taxed which has some 2,600 out of a possible 23,000 or more consumer items on it. It is clearly the case that this is a tax on consumers no matter which way you look at it. This is a move from a government that said it would not introduce a new tax&mdash;it made that commitment many times. The Treasurer (Mr Costello), the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and all of the coalition members said in all of their promises and in all of their policy documents that there would be no new taxes. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> As other senators have said, this is a backdoor way of getting a consumption tax in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The list of 2,600 items is very interesting. Why are there just 2,600? When it comes to balls, why is it that we have baseballs, softballs and T&hyphen;balls, but not golf balls, cricket balls, footballs and so on? What is the difference when it comes to differentiating one ball from another? Also, there are knives other than fishing knives. I am very interested in the fishing issue, and on the list is fly fishing reels that do not exceed a weight of 256 grams. What is the difference?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a whole host of questions that must be asked. We get to water dispensers. I think Senator Calvert said that the tax is only on luxury items. But our poor old pets cannot have water bowls that are designed to be mounted in cages for small pets. It is really quite a ridiculous situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More important is the fact that this government has also said that it is about creating employment, yet it now proposes to introduce a tax and change certain aspects of the current act. Some industries will suffer as a result of these changes&mdash;in particular, some industries in my state. One industry that will suffer is an industry which is just in the process of starting up. They will be hit with a tax when clearly they should not be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is about an employment oriented export industry. I would have thought that this government, given all of the things it has said in the past, would have been all for promoting these types of industries. Instead, what do they do? They put a three per cent tax on them&mdash;a tax that has some major implications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I notice that Senators Gibson and Watson from Tasmania are now in the chamber. You ought to be very interested in this issue, because you know that our state is suffering very badly as a result of a lack of investment. Therefore, you ought to be ensuring that we are not burdened with further imposts that may deter potential investors and developments in Tasmania.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier this week I had the opportunity to read the Australian Stock Exchange's 1994 share ownership survey. It is the fourth of its kind since 1986. These surveys have been conducted as a means of gauging the extent of share ownership by individual Australians as opposed to share ownership by governments, corporates, institutions and overseas investors. The surveys include data about the characteristics of individual Australian shareholders.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although time does not permit me tonight to elaborate on all the findings of the survey, there is one particular statistic that I would like to draw the Senate's attention to.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The survey indicates that share ownership by tertiary graduates more than doubled during the years 1991 to 1994. However, over the same period share ownership by those who had not completed high school halved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These statistics are another indication, if one were needed, of how those people in our community who are most vulnerable are the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2303"> first affected by a government's inability to manage an economy. As you will recall, Mr Acting Deputy President, the period 1991 to 1994 marked the trough of the economic maladministration of the former Labor government under Prime Minister Keating. It is now clear to all Australians that, while the former Labor government was desperately attempting to spend its way out of the quagmire of economic failure, many of the very people it said it was trying to help were in fact being made worse off by those very same efforts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a lesson in this history for all governments, and there is a billboard size message in this history for all senators. The message I would suggest is this: before parliaments, governments or vested interests in the community seek to defend, isolate or protect the expenditure of taxpayers' funds, particularly by claiming that no program should ever be abolished or altered, they should be entirely sure that the expenditure in question not only is contributing in a positive way to the welfare of our society but also represents the best way of achieving the relevant goal. Some will say this is economic rationalism at its worst, that this is the thinking of bean counters. But, if seeking to get the maximum benefit for those in most need is a definition of economic rationalism, thank heavens for rational economists and may the beans be counted forever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The National Commission of Audit report to the government released last week has been summarily dismissed by many, including many Labor and Democrat senators. I find such prejudices unfortunate and a derogation of responsibility to the Australian people. There are many recommendations of the audit commission report which I understand are unpalatable to many in our community. That this should be so is not surprising. The report uncovers many desperately disturbing trends in our society. If it can be said that the recommendations are extreme, it is only because the problems they address are extreme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is therefore surprising, indeed disturbing, is that certain senior politicians in this place and the other have been prepared to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> dismiss the recommendations without first considering the extent of the problems those recommendations seek to address. It is one matter for a sick patient to say to the doctor, `I do not like your medicine,' but it is an entirely different thing for the patient to say to the doctor, `I don't believe I'm sick,' even though the patient is crippled, run&hyphen;down, decaying and forecast to get worse as time goes by.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that the Australian people will be well served when the full ramifications of the National Commission of Audit report are fully evaluated and analysed. While debate at present is focused on many of the severe remedies outlined by the commissioners, there has yet to be a reasoned and balanced assessment of many of the critical demographic, economic and social trends contained in the report. I urge all senators to read deep into this report, for, as always, the devil will be in the detail. In this instance the detail is the message of trends and directions of our nation. We, as the elected representatives of all Australians, have this obligation to our people. I hope hysteria and blind prejudice will not obscure this critical assessment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having briefly strayed from the matter of the stock market, I would like to now return to the theme I commenced with. The stock market is an entity much misunderstood. It is not the playground of the young, as some would say, any more than it is the refuge of the greedy. It is rather the interaction of many thousands of ordinary Australians, institutions and companies. All participate in the hope of advancing economic wellbeing; all take risks; all hope for a better future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To help Australians understand their stock market, the Australian Stock Exchange, ASX, has taken a particularly committed attitude to educating Australians on the workings of the market. In this role of education, the ASX has developed a number of surprisingly innovative and instructive programs which target specific groups and individuals in our society. I would like to highlight two of these programs this evening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An education program designed for senior secondary school students utilises a share market game which aims to provide students <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2304"> with a practical insight into the workings of the share market. The game is a computer simulation exercise based on the buying and selling of shares. At a national level, approximately 20,000 school students from 900 schools across the nation participate in this activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ASX is also using the services of the Internet to provide access to this game. Internet access will be available at the beginning of 1997. Considering the estimation that 71 per cent of schools will have access to the Internet by 1997, the number of students with access to the game should increase substantially. The Stock Exchange is also in the process of developing a public version of the game, following its success in secondary schools. It seems that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Monopoly</EMPHASIS> will never be the same.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second program I would like to mention this evening is perhaps one of the most enterprising education programs I have ever encountered and an example of a truly commercial entity in this community. Recently the ASX began a trial program to provide public lectures on trains. The pilot program was held in association with the Australian Commuter Education Services Department of the University of Western Sydney. A number of western Sydney evening trains were targeted for the exercise. Lectures on share investment were given to commuters while they were travelling home from work. The pilot course was supported by City Rail and attracted 26 participants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many other programs I could bring to the Senate's attention. Public open days, Women's Investment Day, ethnic seminars and in-house lecture series in capital cities and regional and rural locations have all been developed by the ASX to bring the stock market into the homes of average Australians in a manner that makes the one-minute flash on the evening's news comprehensible to more and more Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The operation of the market is often maligned by many of the senators of the Labor and the Australian Democrat parties. They find the market to be unjust and soulless. They consider it to be important to control market participants and to protect individuals <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> from themselves. They may even go so far as to believe that governments have the capacity to judge what is really best for people. With the greatest of respect for all senators who hold these views, I have to say that you are wrong. The assumptions which underlie beliefs such as these are fallacious.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given valid information it is the individual who is best placed to make those investment decisions, whether it is with or it is without professional advice. The information sessions conducted by the ASX can serve only to enhance the ability of individuals to make those decisions in a rational manner which will best serve their interests. Regulators and legislators have a major role to play in ensuring potential investors have sufficient access to information. However, we should make sure that we leave the decisions to the individual.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the Stock Exchange on its 1994 survey and its educational and promotional activities. The initiatives undertaken in these areas by the ASX are innovative and could provide a blueprint for other organisations in this country. By investing in the Australian stock market, Australians encourage confidence in our free enterprise system and help to develop and sustain economic growth for today and for the future.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the 1996 election campaign the now Prime Minister, John Howard, made himself as small a target as possible. In the United States one of the Clinton presidential campaign slogans was, `Change verses more of the same.' John Howard's slogan could have been, `More of the same' in 1996. He did not talk about his plans for Australia except in the broadest terms. He was relying on the `It's time' factor and his strategy was to keep his mouth shut and his head down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That contrasts sharply with John Hewson's election style in 1993. At least John Hewson let the Australian people know what to expect if they got a coalition government. John Howard did not have the guts to go to the Australian people in March of this year with his plans for the country. He knew that if he <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2305"> shared his plans for Australia he would have been rejected, as John Hewson was rejected in 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, now that John Howard is in government, he is putting into effect his secret agenda. What we are seeing now is John Howard setting the scene for a reintroduction of the Fightback agenda. John Howard asked the Treasurer, Peter Costello, to start tilling the ground into which the Fightback seedlings will be planted. So the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) drew up the terms of reference for the National Commission of Audit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They drew up terms of reference so that they could get the answers they wanted. They wanted someone to tell them that it is time to slash and burn the public sector, to get rid of 28,000 public servants; they wanted someone to tell them to introduce Medicare co-payments and cut pharmaceutical benefits; to means test the child-care cash rebate; to charge people for the care they need in nursing homes; to dump responsibility for health, education and welfare on the states; to withdraw from public housing, to line the pockets of landlords with rental subsidies but not to build decent public housing; to make university education as inaccessible as it was in the 1950s and 1960s, when John Howard was a student and when you needed well-off parents to be allowed to set foot inside the gates of a university. Every pensioner is now on notice. They wanted someone to tell them to end Labor's indexation of pensions and pensioners have no guarantees past this budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first phase of the attack on the Australian people will be the August budget. It was foreshadowed yesterday in a document leaked from the Department of Social Security: cuts in family payments; attacks on the long-term unemployed; parenting payments to stop when a child reaches 12; slashing rental assistance&mdash;6&half; billion dollars worth of cuts. If they are not the cuts, there will be other cuts. They have exposed the second phase of their attack this week in the National Commission of Audit, which is their long-term plan for an assault on our standard of living in this country. The National Commission of Audit <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> report is the conservative's blueprint for their next term. It is wishful thinking for them, but if they were to be elected, that is the blueprint for the future for them.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A coalition will not get another term because the Australian people will reject these destructive policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Significantly, Mr Costello did not ask the Commission of Audit to consider revenue raising measures. Could it be that he knew his mates in the Business Council of Australia and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry could be relied on to keep up the pressure for a GST and give the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) the opportunity to do a somersault when, if there were a next term for this government, they could bring back the GST?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The GST is the third leg of the trifecta as far as the Liberal Party is concerned. The whole GST campaign is lovingly choreographed by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>. Despite our denials, they have even reported that the left of the Labor Party supports the idea. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> has some bizarre idea that the Business Council of Australia and ACOSS and the left of the Labor Party are going to work together to bring about a GST. That is how obsessed they are with piping their own line. Other journalists, unfortunately, are repeating this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We in the left, like our colleagues at ACOSS, are concerned about fair and broadly based tax revenue collection. We are concerned that the burden of taxation is equitably spread. We abhor tax avoidance, but let me place on record once and for all that the left of the Australian Labor Party does not believe that a consumption tax is a fair and equitable way of raising tax revenue. Not one section of the left of the Labor Party in any state have come forward with a proposal for a GST. We do not support a consumption tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The burden of a consumption tax disproportionately falls on those families on low incomes, who spend a greater proportion of the family income in buying necessities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consumption taxes never remain at the level at which they are introduced. We have seen the evidence of other OECD countries. In Denmark, where a consumption tax was introduced at the rate of 10 per cent, the rate <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2306"> is now 25 per cent. In Britain it was originally 10 per cent; it is now 17&half; per cent. Sweden went from 11.1 per cent to 25 per cent. On average the initial rate of introduction of a consumption tax is 12.6 per cent and the average rate after a few years is 17.1 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The usual reason for pushing the consumption tax line is that consumption taxes minimise tax avoidance. Let us minimise tax avoidance by all means but, for my part, let us look at the people who can afford to contribute more in this country. Mike Steketee had a whole list of areas we could tighten up in an article in last week's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>: dividend imputation, tax breaks for infrastructure bonds&mdash;that has been debated this week&mdash;and negative gearing. Let us look at those 80 people with assets of over $30 million each who have reported taxable incomes of less than $20,000 a year. Some of these people are claiming Austudy for their children. That is the sort of obscenity that we have in this community at present. Let us start with Australia's top 100 tax avoiders, whose names the department already has.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So as far as I am concerned the Labor Party has a united position of opposition to the main thrust of the National Commission of Audit. Of course there are positive things; I am not denying that. But the main thrust of the proposals is definitely from the extreme economic rationalist viewpoint and clearly reflects that agenda. We have even had the Liberal Party leadership so embarrassed by the proposals being so extreme that they are trying to move away from them. It is significant when we turn to the issue of the GST that the very last piece of legislation considered in this chamber just a few minutes ago, the customs tariff legislation, was a consumption tax where this government, because of their business friends and the pressure from them, moved to thrusting the tax burden onto ordinary people&mdash;a classic example of the priorities of this government. When business interests moved on them, they jumped.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that everybody in the Labor Party, as our leader has made clear, is opposed to a consumption tax. The left of the Labor Party, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the right, the centre and the independent people in the Labor Party all support the position that we have put in two elections opposing it. I just wish that the people who represent business, the Business Council and the business interests that are associated with this push for a consumption tax, would keep the debate to their own people because we on this side of the chamber reject their view.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to address three topics briefly. The first relates to the report of the Tripartite Working Party on Labour Standards, which I will be seeking to table later. Secondly, I will be referring to a collection of documents which show the infiltration of right&hyphen;wing elements in gun shows and expositions, and in the organisations of genuine shooters. I will be seeking to table those documents also. They have been cleared with the portfolio holders and the whips to ensure that there is no difficulty with having them tabled. Thirdly, I will advert to the Victorian government's sacking of 21 regional business facilitators. I am not sure whether that sacking has already happened or whether it is to be implemented soon, but it is something of great concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Tripartite Working Party on Labour Standards was established in response to a motion of mine which the Senate passed unanimously some 18 months ago. That resolution called on the government to take action on the issue of exploitation of children in child labour situations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tripartite working party has worked assiduously for more than 12 months under the chairmanship of a former Attorney&hyphen;General, the Hon. Michael Duffy, and has produced a report which, I believe, needs to be seriously considered by this government. The recommendations of the report call on the government to take action against core labour standards&mdash;which is code for forced labour, child labour and other labour conditions&mdash;and to give priority to occurrences in our region.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2307">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report says that we should and must incorporate issues of social importance, with particular reference to child labour, into our trade negotiations. It suggests that Australian government representatives and our financial institutions should build those issues into the programs and funding that they provide to other countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The recommendations follow reasonably closely the submission that I made to the tripartite working party. I put forward the view that simply prohibiting the importation of goods made by child labour will not fix the problem; we must address the abject poverty of families in many Third World developing countries, who are virtually compelled either to exploit their children in their own backyards or to sell them into bondage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I proposed that the AusAID agency concerned with overseas aid expenditure allocate a small amount to a pilot project providing primary school facilities in those areas where child labour is rife. I also proposed the expenditure of some money to generate work and income opportunities for parents. The report suggested expenditure of $15 million per annum over four years. I was more modest in my submission, asking for $20 million for the pilot program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had some discussions on this matter with the Minister for Trade, Mr Tim Fischer. I said that while I recognised that the government is concerned that labour conditions per se are the concern of the ILO and is therefore reluctant to move on these recommendations, surely there is some obligation on civilised nations like Australia to take some note of child labour and the 20 million children estimated to be subjected to extreme exploitation in our region. I said that the government should consider taking some specific action in that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report will now be available from the table office. I recommend that people interested in this issue obtain a copy. I seek leave to table this report.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The second collection of documents that I wish to address briefly was provided by a constituent of mine <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> who belongs to the Gun Control Group. The documents suggest that at gun shows and gun expositions held annually in Melbourne there is on display, unfortunately, some quite obnoxious material, including swastikas and other nazi insignia, and literature from right&hyphen;wing organisations, such as the Australian League of Rights and the Australians' Right to Bear Arms Association.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, at some of these exhibitions, old and banned copies of the magazine <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lock, Stock and Barrel</EMPHASIS> were available. Having been the target of quite sleazy and obscene attacks from that particular publication, and from leaflets distributed in several Melbourne suburbs, I appreciate the concerns of this constituent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These gun shows and expositions are not generally open to the public, and certainly not to the media, and it is, I understand, fairly difficult to access them. However, some people obviously were able to do that&mdash;have taken photographs, picked up leaflets and have placed this before us. I believe it is a matter of public interest to consider that and to suggest to shooters and shooter organisations who are genuine sports people and genuine hunters that they should ensure that these people do not infiltrate their organisations and do not use the occasions where guns are being sold for the propagation of extremist right&hyphen;wing propaganda which, surely in our society, we should avoid. I seek leave to table this set of documents.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The final item that I wish to briefly advert to is an article by Peter Hunt in the newspaper <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekly Times</EMPHASIS>  of 12 June. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Victoria's rural townships have been hit by a state government move to sack 21 regional business facilitators.</PARA>
<PARA>That is in the face of an independent study of the decline in services to rural communities, which was commissioned by the Anglican Church and which found that each facilitator assisted in developing at least 20 new suitable business ventures each year. The report's author, consultant Kate Hely, spent six months last year talking to 17 community organisations and 133 individuals in the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2308"> Mallee, the Goulburn Valley and the Western and Central Districts. It is not just a trumped up report. It really does show the value of regional business facilitators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also relevant to what is being done at Commonwealth levels. I draw the attention of senators to the so-called REDOs, the regional economic development organisations, which were established by the previous government and which, I hope, will be continued by this government. I wonder what this government will say to this move by a state government to withdraw its people and throw the whole load onto the Commonwealth government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was one particular community in Donald, in western Victoria, where I had occasion to meet Mr Graham Harris, the regional business facilitator of the program. The article mentions him and some enterprises. The Donald Fairmark shirt factory is mentioned.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in great sadness tonight to speak of Jack Boardman. Jack Boardman was a longstanding acquaintance of mine. He was a man I greatly admired. It is not true to say that we always agreed but, if we did not agree, I must say that I was always forced to acknowledge the overwhelming compassion he expressed and the absolute sincerity of the views that he held.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John Gorey Boardman died last Thursday, 20 June 1996, aged 77. He died from injuries sustained after being hit by a car on Monday night whilst on his way to attend a meeting of the Friends of East Timor. A long&hyphen;time member of the Labor Party, Jack Boardman and his wife Beryl were recognised in December 1993 with Outstanding Service Awards. With Beryl, he had a lifetime commitment to the socialist and pacifist movements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was a member of the ALP from at least the 1960s, and possibly earlier. He was a member of the Scarborough Karrinyup branch of the ALP, holding most positions in the branch over the years as well as being a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> delegate to the Stirling electorate council and to the state executive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Jack and Beryl worked tirelessly on every election campaign anyone could remember, often to the point where concern was felt for their physical wellbeing. Indeed, in the 1996 campaign, Jack was given a reasonably small area to letterbox in deference to his age, but he always beat the rest of us by taking on at least two other areas to do as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was a quiet and caring man of great compassion who put his views in a quiet and most dignified manner, even though they were often at variance with the prevailing view within the party. He was quite fearless in expressing his views, to the great annoyance and inconvenience of some and to the great admiration of others. Jack and Beryl's contributions to party debates on matters as diverse as Aboriginal affairs, the environment, social justice and foreign relations have been immense, impressive and generally well ahead of their time. Jack was a committed socialist and pacifist even during World War II, when he served with great distinction in the Air Warning Wireless Company in New Guinea, commonly known as the Coastwatchers, and later in the Z Forces in Singapore and the 2/8 Australian Commando Squadron in Bougainville. He joined the Commandos in Lae in 1942 and fought in the Bougainville campaign right until the end of the war. He was very highly regarded by his comrades at arms in the Commandos as a man of great courage and immense forbearance. As one of his comrades said, `If Jack was on your patrol, you knew your patrol had an edge.' He was also a man of great tolerance and understanding, who was always there for his comrades with an ear to listen and a shoulder to lean on in their moments of great trauma.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commandos operated almost exclusively behind enemy lines to harass, ambush and sabotage, make maps and take prisoners. They were the elite unit of the army at the time. That a man who had served his country with such distinction held the views he did, particularly regarding pacifism, strengthened his case immeasurably in the eyes of many of those he dealt with.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2309">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Jack was involved in many other organisations for the betterment of mankind as well. He was a long-time campaigner for Aboriginal land rights and the Aboriginal cause generally, most recently in the Swan Brewery dispute in Perth, and was frequently seen there early in the mornings, often in his old, yellow raincoat in the most atrocious weather.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Jack was a member of the United Nations Association from 1949 and he and Beryl gave countless hundreds of hours of volunteer service to it in the ensuing years. I mentioned briefly his support for the campaign to free East Timor. He participated in the voyage to Dili harbour of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lusitano Express</EMPHASIS> in March 1992 which was forced to abandon its mission by the Indonesian navy. Jack was a constant campaigner to free East Timor. This is but one example of his commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He also participated in many environment and conservation campaigns, including the building of high&hyphen;rise developments on the Scarborough beachfront and the construction of a major road through the Trigg bushland reserve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">His infectious enthusiasm and wonderment at his environment will be greatly missed by all who knew him. No more will we hear his warm and sincere expressions: `Is that right?', `Wonderful!', `Well, isn't that marvellous?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr President, I know you knew Jack Boardman too, and I would like to say: so long, Jack. I extend my sincere condolences to his wife Beryl and his three sons&mdash;Warwick, Ralph and Trevor and their families, including five grandchildren.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<TIME.STAMP>(7.53 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I wish to draw the attention of honourable senators to the increasingly responsible role and tasks undertaken by trustees of all the superannuation funds in Australia. The total retirement savings of all Australians has recently been estimated at $240 billion. This is predicted to grow to $2,000 billion by the year 2020. There are about 115,000 superannuation funds in Australia, of which 110,000 are small private funds with less than five members. These <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> small funds are called the mums and dads schemes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Insurance and Superannuation Commission estimates that some 180,000 trustees of those funds are so small that they are excluded from a lot of the detailed compliance requirements under the SIS legislation&mdash;about 25,000 trustees of the remaining 5,000 funds. However, the industry is dominated by a small number of very large funds; the top one per cent account for more than 83 per cent of all superannuation fund assets, and 97 per cent of members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Trustees are controlling increasing proportions of our national wealth, and their decisions can have a far&hyphen;reaching impact on investment in Australia. Superannuation funds control 25 per cent of equities listed on the Australian Stock Exchange, and a six&hyphen;fold increase is predicted over the decade of the 1990s. The import of the decisions made by the trustees of these funds on resource and infrastructure developments in our country, for example, is enormous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to take this opportunity of referring to some research undertaken by Dr Oldsberg, an economic sociologist and Director of the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees. Dr Oldsberg has just completed a major research of trustees' duties, responsibilities and levels of expertise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Using a sample of 550 trustees representing a cross&hyphen;section of various types of funds, she has found that: trustees are generally young; 40 per cent are under 40, mostly male; only 13 per cent are women and are usually a trustee of just one fund&mdash;about 75 per cent; trustees are extremely committed to their task&mdash;and that is the issue I want to emphasise tonight&mdash;and trustees are either nominated and appointed or elected to their board positions. The vast majority of them are not paid, and perform their duties in an honorary capacity. Rarely are trustees relieved of other duties to attend to their trustee responsibilities. The duties and responsibilities of these trustees are increasing. Their liabilities under the new Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act are becoming more onerous and there is mounting concern among some trustees about the difficulties of meeting this <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2310"> challenge&mdash;but I think they are rising to the occasion very well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> She also found that trustees are working hard to develop their expertise to meet the challenges of growing and increasingly complex funds. The vast majority of trustees have done some specialised trustee education and training. Sixty per cent of trustee boards have a special allocation for trustee education and training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees research reveals that despite the complexities of superannuation and the new demands of managing the funds, the trustees have an exceptional level of commitment and confidence in being a trustee. They have a personal commitment both to ensure that the funds perform as well as possible and thereby enhance members' retirement benefits and to safeguard members' retirement savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Trustees must be ever conscious of their responsibilities. They have not only a corporate but, unlike company directors, a personal responsibility. If they manage their funds prudently in accordance with the requirements of the SIS Act, they will have gone a long way to ensuring that the risk of fraud in their fund has been minimised and they will have discharged their responsibilities according to the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But a system whereby there is continual monitoring of funds and constant challenging of the effectiveness of the funds' controls and procedures is essential. They need to operate according to risk management procedures, maintain effective control and supervise vulnerable areas very closely. The responsibility for detecting and preventing frauds rests solely with trustees. They cannot delegate that responsibility, but they can take expert advice. For example, where an external administrator has been appointed, trustees must have foolproof assurance that this responsibility can be carried out within the context of the fund's internal controls.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Dr Oldsberg's research has found that, as the funds grow larger and member accounts become more substantial, trustees are beginning to adopt a more pro&hyphen;active approach. They are moving from being fund administra tors to becoming active fund managers. They are now more actively searching for investments which will provide the greatest rate of growth for fund members commensurate with prudential safeguards. They are increasingly choosing equity ownership of Australian companies. They channel about 40 per cent of their assets into local equities. These investments will continue to have an enormous benefit in fostering the growth, development and efficiency of our economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an increasing interest in issues of board structures and governance, remuneration and performance of company senior management, the relationship of executive and independent directors on boards. But, as the Trustee of the Year, Ross Greenwood says, the trustee's role is easy while the fund is growing. However, where there is a contraction of funds, some trustees around may be ill&hyphen;equipped to handle these situations. In this context training is absolutely essential. In this context the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees is setting up a national program of performance based training workshops for trustees, and I commend them on this particular initiative.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>
