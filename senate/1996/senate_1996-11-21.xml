<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That we are opposed to any moves to cut funding to universities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe that funding cuts to universities can only have a negative impact on society and will impede the development of our Nation.</PARA>

<TITLE>Higher Education</TITLE>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable President and Members of the Senate in the Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That we condemn the Federal government's proposed changes to HECS whereby the law degree will be placed in the highest HECS tier of the differential system for students commencing in 1997. We deplore this action for the following reasons:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. The differential HECS system is inherently inequitable in that it exacerbates existing disadvantages confronting many students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. Law faculties have long been funded at the lowest level of the Relative Funding Model. As a result law faculties have been increasingly under&hyphen;resourced and over&hyphen;crowded, compromising the quality of legal education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. Course costs cannot be used to justify placing law in the highest category. Such a system places law students at a double disadvantage&mdash;high levels of HECS and inadequate resources. Furthermore, the majority of law students are also required to pay considerable amounts for their practical legal training, and as such already face a significant financial burden.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">4. Law courses lead to a variety of occupations such that there are vast earning differences between law graduates regardless of whether they are in the legal profession or otherwise. The reality is that 50 per cent of law graduates will not enter the legal profession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We strongly oppose the Federal Government's cuts to higher education funding and proposed alterations to HECS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your petitioners, as in duty bound, most humbly ask that the Senate, in Parliament assembled, abandon these destructive policies immediately.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Honourable President and the Members of the Senate</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are saddened and distressed about the Hon. Alexander Downer's statement in Parliament on 5 November that `He is willing to meet with Tamil groups in Australia provided that they indicate to him, in writing, that they condemn the terrorist activities of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam'. By doing this, the Minister has made the inference that all Tamils/Tamil Groups in Australia are in some way responsible for actions of the LTTE.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We cannot honestly comprehend this rather peculiar position taken by the Minister against a section of the Australian community in a selective manner. We are also confused over the motive behind the Minister's statement at a time when it is the Sri Lankan government troops who are daily committing terrible atrocities against the innocent Tamils in the occupied areas and pursuing a military solution to the crisis under the pretext of waging a `war for peace'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are living in Australia and we are advocating for a peaceful resolution to the civil war. Regardless of what the minister said, it has always been the position of the Australia Tamils to condemn all violent activities in Sri Lanka, be it the LTTE or the Sri Lankan government. Thus, we are unsure about why he singled the Tamils out as the ones needing to condemn the terrorist activities in Sri Lanka.</PARA>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 amends the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 giving effect to the Government's Budget commitments of enhanced quality in education and provision of scholarships, increased independence <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5741"> for institutions and a more diverse higher education sector with wider choices for students. At the same time it contains a package of measures that contributes to the Government's savings task in the fairest way possible while advancing key objectives for the higher education sector and setting the framework on which the sector can build for the future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments contained in the Bill achieve a fairer balance between public and private funding of higher education. To achieve that balance, new Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS) charges will be introduced having regard to the anticipated salary levels of graduates and the wide range of course costs. Through another amendment, individuals will repay their HECS and Open Learning Deferred Payment Scheme (OLDPS) debt more quickly through a reduction in income thresholds at which repayments are to commence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will give Australian students the same opportunity as overseas students to purchase an undergraduate place at a Commonwealth funded Australian university. From 1998, universities will be able to charge fees for Australian undergraduate students only after the target number of places for HECS-only students are filled. For health policy reasons, the Bill excludes Medicine, as the Government wishes to limit the number of medical graduates. The overwhelming majority of students will continue to contribute to their education through HECS alone.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will give the Open Learning Agency the discretion to set the level of charges for its higher education units but will maintain at the present level the amount of the charge which may be deferred by clients under the OLDPS.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill furthers the Government's commitment to equity in higher education by providing annually 1,000 merit based scholarships, building over four years to a total of 4,000. The scholarships target equity groups including students from low socio&hyphen;economic, rural and isolated backgrounds and Indigenous Australians. Scholarship recipients will be fully exempted from the HECS charge.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill provides responsible levels of funding for teaching and research. Funding for research infrastructure, collaborative grants and Australian Postgraduate Awards is increased, and funding for the Capital Development Pool is continued as previously announced for 1997 and 1998. Additional funds are provided for administrative support to assist with the changed administrative arrangements during the transition to the new HECS arrangements. Supplementation is provided for price movements in line with the indexation arrangements announced in the 1995 Budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has developed a comprehensive package of measures for the higher education sector <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that gives greater flexibility to universities in generating revenue whilst ensuring that qualified students will not be prevented from entering higher education because of their inability to pay. Given the long lead times involved in planning for higher education institutions, it is important that measures contained in the Bill be in place for 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill represents a tightly integrated package of initiatives which contributes to the Government's savings task in the fairest way by achieving a more equitable balance between public and private funding. The legislation must be introduced and passed in the 1996 Spring sittings to ensure that changes to funding levels, including the increase in research funding, Australian Postgraduate Awards and funding for scholarships, are available to students from 1997. The measures in the Bill have regard to the planning timetable of higher education institutions and Government commitments not to increase the HECS levels for existing students.</PARA>

<STATE> (Queensland)</STATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee, I seek leave to table and incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  a report to the Senate on the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Legislative Instruments Bill 1996 and to move a motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The document read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As chairman of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances I would like to report to the Senate on aspects of the Legislative Instruments Bill 1996, which will make important changes to the ability of parliament to scrutinise and, if the Senate wishes, to disallow legislative instruments. The committee believes that it should report on the bill before the second reading debate, so that Senators can come to the debate with forewarning of a number of issues which the committee regards as matters of concern. At the outset, however, I am pleased to say that the committee supports the bill, subject to a number of important exceptions which I will address shortly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The basic structure and purpose of the bill is encouraging, resulting generally from recommendations of a 1992 Report by the Administrative Review Council, Rule Making by Commonwealth Agencies. An earlier bill to implement these recommendations was introduced into the Senate on 30 June 1994. The Selection of Bills Committee then referred the bill to the Regulations and Ordinances Committee. I am pleased to recall that the then government accepted all of the major recommendations of the committee, which has therefore already had a significant input into the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In my remarks on the bill I will concentrate on its effects on parliament. The bill will in a number of ways enhance the ability of parliament to scrutinise delegated legislation. The bill will increase the types of legislative instruments which are subject to tabling and disallowance, numbers of which at present may be made and operate without any parliamentary oversight at all. Also, the bill requires legislative instruments to be tabled within six sitting days, instead of the present 15. This is a considerable improvement, because 15 sitting days can cover a period of months, during which parliament may not be even be aware that an important instrument has been made and is in operation. The bill provides for tabling of Explanatory Statements. This again is an improvement. Although the efforts of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee have ensured that all legislative instruments are now accompanied by adequate explanatory material, formal provision for this is appropriate. A House of the parliament may also now require material which is incorporated in an instrument to be made available. Here also the Regulations and Ordinances Committee has not had any problems when requesting such material, but provision for this in the bill is not inappropriate. The bill also provides for motions of disallowance <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5745"> to be postponed for up to six months and in some situations this could be useful.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill, therefore, promises much, the second reading speech advising of a significant shift in control over delegated legislation back towards the parliament. However, the actual provisions include a number of exemptions which diminish that  parliamentary role.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee has initiated considerable correspondence with the Attorney&hyphen;General and with other Ministers about its concerns with the areas of the bill which dilute  parliamentary control. Together with the committee's Legal Adviser, Emeritus Professor Whalan, I have had several lengthy meetings with the Attorney&hyphen;General to discuss these concerns and the committee is grateful for this courtesy by the Minister. The efforts of the committee resulted in government amendments to the bill in the House of Representatives to meet some of our concerns and here again the committee is grateful for this action by the Attorney&hyphen;General. Nevertheless, four areas of concern remain.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first area of concern to the committee is a provision under which the Attorney&hyphen;General may give a conclusive certificate that an instrument is either legislative or not legislative. If the Attorney certifies that the instrument is not legislative then parliament has no powers at all in respect of that instrument. The executive can then make any laws it likes under that particular provision without parliament even knowing, far less having the opportunity to disallow the instrument. Such a certificate by the Attorney is reviewable by the Federal Court under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act, but review under that act is only available in respect of procedural legalities. In any event, anyone wishing to take action in the Federal Court would apparently have to pay tens of thousands of dollars in lawyers' fees. The power of the Attorney to give conclusive certificates, reviewable only on the procedural formalities, is a serious diminution of the rights of parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee believes that these conclusive certificates should be subject to disallowance by either House. This will ensure the proper position of parliament in what is really the starting point of the scrutiny of legislation. Delegated legislation only exists because it is authorised by parliament and it is appropriate that parliament should decide whether such instruments should be subject to scrutiny. In this context I note that the Regulations and Ordinances Committee and the House of Representatives Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee both recommended that certificates be disallowable. Of course, making the Attorney's conclusive certificate subject to disallowance will not affect the right of anyone to seek Federal Court review, if that is their wish. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, the bill generally excludes instruments which provide for national schemes of legislation from  parliamentary disallowance. These schemes, which involve the Commonwealth and the States and Territories, are likely to become more important and it would seem to be quite fundamental that parliament should scrutinise this legislation. To exclude it from  parliamentary control would not seem to be compatible with the stated aim of the bill to give parliament a greater scrutiny role. The committee believes that parliament should have the same options over such instruments as it has over other legislation, much of which is of far less consequence than national schemes. It is incongruous that the national  parliament  should not have control over national legislation. At present the committee scrutinises uniform national scheme regulations and, as the then chairman of the committee, Mal Colston, reported to the Senate on 19 September 1995, the committee has received good cooperation from ministers in this scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thirdly, the bill excludes Quarantine Act proclamations from disallowance, although not from tabling. This exemption was not originally provided for in the present bill, but was introduced as a government amendment. The supplementary explanatory statement gives no explanation at all for the exclusion of disallowance, which appears to be another unnecessary limit on  parliamentary control. Breaches of these proclamations incur various penalties of up to 10 years imprisonment and a fine of up to $100,000. It is inappropriate that legislation resulting in such penalties should not be subject to disallowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fourth and finally, but not least, the bill provides that prescribed instruments providing for terms and conditions of commonwealth employees are deemed not to be legislative instruments. This means that such instruments will not even be tabled in , much less be subject to disallowance. This exemption could include, for instance, determinations of the Remuneration Tribunal which provide for salaries and conditions of ministers,  parliamentarians, judges and members of Commonwealth statutory authorities. At present, of course, these are subject to full  parliamentary disallowance. Last year the Regulations and Ordinances Committee scrutinised 300 of these instruments which the bill now proposes may be excluded from the control and even knowledge of. Most of these were made under delegation or supervised by officers of the Department of Industrial Relations. The committee finds numerous defects in these instruments. In the last week alone I have signed letters to the Minister for Industrial Relations about one Determination which was certainly invalid, another which appeared to be invalid and others which did not comply with the enabling act. Here again this provision is incompatible with the stated aim of the bill to shift control over delegated legislation back towards the parlia <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5746"> ment. The fact that such exclusions must be prescribed is not a satisfactory safeguard, because there could be a period of some months between making and the next sitting day, during which defective instruments could be made and which would remain in force even if the regulations were disallowed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In summary, then, the Regulations Ordinances Committee supports the general thrust of the bill and the great majority of its provisions. The bill will assist the committee to carry out its function of ensuring that legislative instruments are of high quality and, as I mentioned earlier, will in most areas improve the position of parliament as against the makers of legislative instruments. However, there are exemptions to the main principles of the bill which exclude parliament from its proper scrutiny role and which may even take away scrutiny powers which parliament presently enjoys. On behalf of the committee I draw these defects to the attention of the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The statement read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, I present the report of the Senate Employment, Education and Training Committee on the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill makes a number of amendments to the 1988 Act. The Committee's report addresses three major initiatives introduced by the Bill, namely: modifications to the Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS); removal of the prohibitions on offering full fee paying places to Australian undergraduate students; and the provision for the Open Learning Agency to charge for delivering units of study.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill introduces three changes to HECS. First, it lowers income thresholds for repayment of accumulated HECS debt. Second, it provides for an overall increase in contribution levels. Third, the Bill introduces differential HECS contributions from 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These measures refine the current HECS system by striking a better balance between public and private funding of higher education. The differential HECS does this in two ways. The contribution students make will now more closely reflect the actual costs of the courses they study. It will also reflect more closely the private benefits to graduates in terms of expected income in their private careers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee noted that the average level of HECS contribution under the new system is about 27 per cent of course costs when discounts, such as the interest-free-deferral, are taken into consideration. In international terms, this level conforms to the general range of private contributions to public higher education.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is too early to predict the impact of the new HECS system on participation rates by students. The Committee therefore believes that the effects of the modified HECS are monitored closely. In particular, the Committee considers that high priority should be given to monitoring access and participation trends according to discipline and socio-economic status.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also believes there may be a case for science units to be assigned to a lower HECS band than is currently proposed. This depends on whether there is an adverse impact on demand for science courses as a side-effect of the differential HECS. Accordingly, the Committee has recommended that the allocation of science units to HECS band 2 be adjusted in the event of there proving to be an adverse effect on demand for science as measured by enrolments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill opens the way for universities to offer full fee paying places to Australian students. This measure addresses the current anomaly which allows for universities to offer places to foreign full fee paying students but prohibits universities <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5747"> offering full fee paying positions to domestic students.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important to note that fee&hyphen;paying places will be additional to the number of government&hyphen;funded places available to Australian undergraduates.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Universities will only be able to enrol fee paying students once they have fulfilled their HECS quota. With any course, the number of fee-paying students will not be allowed to comprise more than 25 per cent of enrolments. Any university which enrols a full fee paying student without first fulfilling its HECS course quota faces an automatic penalty of $9000 for each full fee paying student.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee believes that these restrictions will prevent full fee paying enrolments from crowding out HECS-funded enrolments in higher education. Indeed, it is possible that this measure will free up HECS-funded places in the higher education system for people who currently miss out on places. As some students elect to pay full fees for their first-choice course, they will leave open a HECS-funded place for other students to fill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also examined the claim that the provision for the Open Learning Agency to determine the fees it charges is a pilot scheme for applying a fee system broadly across the higher education sector. In the Committee's view, this claim appears fanciful as the unfunded OLA system differs from the government-funded undergraduate system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 be passed without amendment. I commend the report to the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This report of the Senate Employment, Education and Training Legislation Committee deals with the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 1996. The minority report is tabled within this report. The dissenting report is presented to the Senate by Australian Labor Party senators and Democrat senators, and seeks to highlight just how grave and unjust this bill is. It seeks to highlight the essentially inequitable basis on which this government is seeking to administer higher education policy in this country. This bill and associated measures in terms of reductions in operating grants are a means by which this government will seek to achieve drastic reductions in higher education expenditure over the next four years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In answer to questions that I sought from the department through the estimates process, the extent of those reductions is abundantly <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> clear. The answer to question Nos 9 and 10 published in the additional information booklet to the Senate from the Senate Employment, Education and Training Legislation Committee clearly shows the cuts to the higher education sector. Under program 2.1 they are given effect substantially by this piece of legislation and demonstrate that the government is seeking to remove over the forward estimates period $1.956 billion from the higher education system. If we include additional new initiatives the government is taking, the net effect of the reductions in higher education expenditure according to the department is $1.821 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government says, `That is not the real impact because the revenue measures being introduced through the changes to the higher education contribution scheme mean that the overall reductions are much smaller.' What are the attempts being made by this government to raise revenue? The total impact according to departmental figures is $1.130 billion. It is a very dramatic attempt by this government to change fundamentally the nature of higher education in this country over the life of this parliament. I do not think we have seen many opportunities for governments to embark on such a radical restructure of higher education as we are seeing by this minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an attempt to turn the clock back, to change the direction of higher education, to reduce its overall impact in terms of equity and access, and to make it much more difficult for ordinary Australians to go to university if they do not have the money. They are trying to change a system of higher education fundamentally based on achievement by merit to one of attainment by wealth. That, to me, is the essence of the fundamental injustice of these proposals that are reviewed by this report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For over a decade the Australian government has sought to turn Australia's education system from a minority elitist system into a mass education system. What this government is seeking to do is to undermine that achievement. We have seen the real level of Commonwealth expenditure increase by some 70 per cent under the Labor government. We <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5748"> have seen an expansion in the number of students by some 69 per cent. In fact, there was a growth in funding to support a program aimed at ensuring there was a mass higher education system in this country, which is fitting and highly appropriate for an advanced industrial country such as ours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, this is not the sort of model that this government wishes to follow. This government is seeking to ensure that there is no longer equality of opportunity, that there is no longer governments seeking to achieve that opportunity or equality but seeking to pursue a policy aimed at ensuring that those with wealth get the benefits out of the actions of government in higher education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Working class children and working class people will be disadvantaged as a result of the policies being pursued by this government. We are seeing a government pursue a policy which is fundamentally aimed at destroying the dreams and aspirations of many people in this country who believe education is their right. The government ought to provide assistance to ensure the achievement of that right of every Australian to go to university or enjoy the benefits of higher education through universities and TAFE colleges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite clearly that program is being undermined by this legislation. What we are seeing here is an attempt to increase the charges for higher education&mdash;increased fees and increased HECS. We will see an increase of over 70 per cent on average under this proposal. The government will seek to charge new students HECS contributions of $4,169 compared with the current rate of $2,478.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will see an application of a differential rate of HECS, so discrimination will be built into the system. This is an inherently discriminatory model adopted in pursuit of a budget driven agenda to back up this ideological obsession with the removal of government activity and to undermine the state responsibility for education in this country. That is basically what it is about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will be seeking through this Senate to have that policy changed. We will be asking senators to join us in avoiding some of the most draconian aspects of these policy changes. We will be seeking Senate support for a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> proposition to protect the rights of ordinary Australians to decent education standards and to ensure the continued protection of Australian students from the prospect of being charged up&hyphen;front fees for basic university undergraduate courses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all understand just how biased the system currently is. No-one pretends for a moment that the concept of equality of opportunity has been fully realised. It has been dramatically improved in the last 10 years, but it has not been fully realised. We all understand that. The government's response is to say, `We acknowledge that there are not enough people from various sections of our society going to university. To improve that we will make it more expensive. We will make it harder for the sons and daughters of working people to go to university.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the government's idea of improving equity&mdash;to increase the charges, to increase the cost of going to university. Quite clearly, that is a proposition that is not sustainable logically. I hope that a majority of senators acknowledge that point and seek to change the government's mind by not accepting this legislation and not accepting the premise on which it is based&mdash;the fundamental unequal treatment for different citizens of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not just HECS that is being changed through this legislation; there are a whole series of measures which are aimed at undermining the equity of the Australian higher education system. It is designed primarily to justify the reduction of some 17,000 Commonwealth funded places at universities across this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the minister will argue that there will be an opportunity to expand the number of places, but that is predicated on one assumption&mdash;that is, you do not have to have the brains to go to university, but you will have to have the money. That is a system of education that this parliament ought reject. It ought reject that basic unequal system of education and ensure that we restore some equity, some balance and some commitment to providing equal opportunities for all Australians. We should be striving to achieve that objective, not turning our back on it.</PARA>

He, like many of the people who appeared before the Senate committee, voiced his concern and outrage at some of the promoted changes for the higher education sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Carr said, the financial extent of the cuts that have been made to the higher education sector over the triennium is massive. The estimate that has been put forward previously by the Australian Vice&hyphen;Chancellors Committee has been a loss to the sector of around $1.8 billion over the three years. But, in fact, as Senator Carr reported and is mentioned in our dissenting report, in the estimates committee hearings we were told that an estimated $1.956 billion was to be ripped out of the higher education sector over the next three years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The higher education funding bill that we are dealing with not only details the proposed changes to HECS. We are looking at not only the introduction of differential HECS and the unfair bans that we see. We are looking at law studies being put in the highest bracket, for goodness sake!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The whole rationale behind the minister's differential HECS&mdash;that is, projected income earnings along with course costs&mdash;has been defeated only in the last couple of days with the release of the latest report on graduate starting salaries. It is worth noting that gradu ate starting salaries in this country are at an all time low. So the very rationale for differential HECS has already been exposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The HECS increases are quite sinister as well. We will see an increase across the board for current and future students. That goes against one of the policies that the coalition certainly claim to have had prior to getting into government&mdash;that is, a concern about retrospectivity. Not only will the HECS bans hit those students who are involved in current courses but so will one of the most sinister changes being promoted by this government&mdash;that is, the decline in the threshold at which graduates begin to repay their debts. It is a massive reduction.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Woodley, you are right. It has gone from around average weekly earnings, or $28,000 per annum, down to around $20,000, or around 75 per cent of average weekly earnings. That is the threshold at which students and graduates will now be expected to repay their HECS debts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the worst changes that has been proposed by the government in this budget is the proposal to introduce up-front and full cost undergraduate fees for Australian students. This essentially allows university administrations&mdash;that is, universities around the country&mdash;to charge up-front, full cost fees for all courses except medicine. We can only begin to speculate why medicine has been exempted from these proposed changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5750"> But what we are essentially looking at here is the absolute entrenchment of user pays education in this country. I must add that, while I agree with many of the comments Senator Carr made earlier, in my dissenting report I have made very clear the fact that the Australian Democrats continue to support a publicly funded and accessible higher education system. That means no fees and charges and no barriers so that people in this country have unfettered access to higher education if they have merit. That means people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, women and other traditionally disadvantaged groups&mdash;people with disabilities, indigenous students and people from non-English speak ing backgrounds. The process that I hold partially responsible for the changes that we are seeing here today is the introduction of fees not by this government but by the former ALP government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They unlocked the door. They allowed not only the introduction of user pays but also the reintroduction of tertiary fees in the form of HECS and the higher education administration charge back in 1988 and 1989. I think that is an important point to make because they did open the doors. They also allowed the deregulation of the postgraduate fee paying sector and they allowed up-front and full cost fees to be charged for postgraduate courses. What we see today is a continuation of that process by the coalition government who, according to the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill, will allow the charging of those fees for undergraduate places.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Essentially, what we are saying is that we are going to lock out those disadvantaged groups from higher education in this country. We are not even going to give them appropriate student financial assistance so that they can try to get their foot through the door, because some of the sinister changes that have been made in the budget relate to Austudy as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of other aspects of this report to do with scholarships that are worth reading&mdash;the so-called scholarships that will help people who are disadvantaged gain access to university. Under these changes that will mean 4,000 over four years. Big deal! We are yet to ascertain how those scholarships will be determined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have also been overall cuts to the research quantum. The minister has claimed that we will protect undergraduate places. However, that is going to happen at the expense of postgraduates. So I do not know what we are doing to the future of research and teaching in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats make it very clear in not only our comments in the dissenting report with opposition senators but also <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> our own dissenting report that we believe the changes we have seen are a continuation of a process that began in the late 1980s. Those of you who read the dissenting reports and the evidence provided by the expert witnesses will be very clear that the changes that are proposed by this government are regressive, prohibitively expensive and will lock out poor kids from higher education in this country.

Where are Senator Hill and Senator Tierney now with the outrage they were expressing during the term of the previous government in relation to regressive steps, moving towards a greater level of user pays and changing thresholds in terms of accelerating debt repayments?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ability of people to pay and to live after going through the stages of university has become more and more difficult. There is an assumption here that education is a cost when, in fact, quite clearly over time we know that education is a benefit. It is a benefit to the country and, obviously, it is going to be a benefit to the economy as well. Yet we are actually pulling it further and further away from people who are not rich in our country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is ironic that, just as quite a lot of work is being done to enable a greater participation rate from disadvantaged groups such as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, the courses leading to such things as medicine will become more expensive. Here we are saying that people should be pulling themselves up by their bootstraps but, in fact, we are pulling away the ability for medical services to be offered to indigenous Australians for their own communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a lot of instances here where we are going to see that tertiary education institutions will be a place of privilege. We will have a small group of people who will be the scholarship earners, but it is not exactly a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5751"> princely sum, and the numbers of people involved on merit will be a lot less than what was available before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think this is the wrong direction. Australia cannot afford to go in this direction. When you consider the billions of dollars that are given by taxpayers annually to prop up corporate Australia, what we see today, by way of this report, which says that it is a surprise that the committee recommends that the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 be passed without amendment, is a disgrace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I agree with Senator Stott Despoja that the ALP cannot stand with hands on their hearts and say, `We have not been involved with the beginnings of this,' because they were. We had lively debates in this chamber with Senator Hill and Senator Tierney involved in that debate. Where are they now?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with the sentiments of the preceding speakers, particularly Senator Margetts and Senator Stott Despoja. From the Australian Greens point of view, we should be moving to a free entry system to tertiary education for those people who have not been there before but who want to be equipped to take part in Australian society in the 21st century, when it is going to be even more important than it is now to have a tertiary qualification if you are going to be able to get a job and move into a workplace that is satisfying, productive and fulfilling.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead of that the impediments are growing and, as this minority report points out, the government is actually cutting support to the tertiary sector and putting the onus on to citizens through monetary barriers which they have to jump to be able to undertake their tertiary education.

As Senator Margetts said, at the same time the corporate sector is contributing less and less to the Treasury, so <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that governments at state and federal level are less and less able to fund the education that is necessary to ensure Australia is the clever country that we are touted to be in the last quarter of this century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We ought to be moving towards free entry into tertiary education. It should be the same as primary and secondary education. It is an essential part of a citizen's rights in this day and age. To be making it an elitist option for those who have money in their pockets or whose parents have money in their pockets is the wrong way to go. No wonder the government has taken so little part in this debate because it would be trying to defend the indefensible.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Howard budget which these appropriation bills implement reminds me of the total of the take advertising campaign which Coles ran in the 1960s. This was a campaign which was part of an intense competition between the retailers Coles and Woolworths. The campaign promoted the compelling message that customers when choosing between the two stores should keep their eye firmly on the total of the take, as opposed to perhaps one or two particular specials as were described as being offered by one of those department stores.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is exactly in the same way that Australians should assess the merits of John Howard's budget. They should keep their eyes firmly on the bottom line. If they do that they will see that what John Howard is offering with one hand he is snatching back twice over with the other. Take the family tax initiative for example, which we dealt with yesterday. Of course John Howard has made much of this initiative. For a one income family with two children, one of whom is under the age of five, this will mean an extra $17 a week. For a dual income family earning up to $79,000 it will mean $3.85 a week for each dependent child. That is great. We welcome any help for families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But John Howard's view of families is a very one dimensional view. He seems to think of them as some sort of a cardboard cut&hyphen;out and as being somehow all alone in the world. On this side of the chamber we certainly do understand that they are real. They come in all shapes and sizes and they are not alone. They actually sometimes do need help. They need services and they expect their governments to provide them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me point out during this second reading debate what John Howard's budget has done to some of those services. Take health for example. Notwithstanding his promise not to cut funding for public hospitals, he has taken $800 million from them. This will dramatically increase hospital waiting lists for those who depend on public hospitals. John Howard has also imposed big increases in the cost of prescription drugs. Pensioners will have to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5753"> pay an extra $100 million a year for drugs under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The cost of each script will be increased to $3.20 without any compensating increase in the pension. He has also completely abolished the Commonwealth dental health program to save $100 million a year. What about the Medicare offices where families get their Medicare and child&hyphen;care cash rebates over the counter? John Howard is closing down 84 of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All families want their kids educated and most rely on the public education system. This is a budget that cuts funding for public schools. Assistance for students with disabilities has stopped altogether. Vocational education has been cut and the Howard government has abandoned its agreement to fund growth in the TAFE system. If your kids are at university or hope to get there, you had better start saving, because gone now are the days when higher education was within the reach of all young Australians regardless of where they lived or regardless of their circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Higher education, you might remember, was part of the bad news that John Howard got out of the way before budget night so as not to take the gloss off the family tax initiative. But it does not alter the fact that operating grants for universities were cut by $624 million. Universities will charge more for degree courses and will be able to charge full fees for places above the target number of Commonwealth funded places, which Senator Vanstone has confirmed will be determined at the whim of the minister of the day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If graduates are lucky enough to find a job when they finish, they will have to start their HECS repayments as soon as they earn $20,701, compared with the previous threshold of $28,495. John Howard has set us on a path which will lead back to the bad old days when if you were well off, your kids were okay and if you were not, they were not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those families who use child-care services will find that the $504 million budget cuts will mean higher out&hyphen;of&hyphen;pocket expenses for child care or lower quality child care or both. For those families with family members out of work, this budget will make it much more <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> difficult for those family members to get back into the work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You could only describe the Howard budget in this area as a downright disgrace. John Howard is not game to commit himself to any jobs targets. He has put an end to the Commonwealth Employment Service, first started by Ben Chifley in 1946. He has abolished a huge range of employment programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So if you or your kids have ever benefited from any of these labour market programs, take note&mdash;they are either being slashed or completely abolished by these appropriation bills. Take note of them: jobskills, LEAP, new work opportunities, jobtrain, the special intervention program, accredited training for youth, skillshare, jobclubs, the mobility assistance scheme and the TAP program for Aboriginals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about the impact of John Howard's budget on older Australians? John Howard said that he had spread the pain equally, but he has spread it to the most vulnerable in our community&mdash;the sick, the jobless and the elderly. Elderly people in need of nursing home care will have to pay an up- front entry fee. There is no limit to what nursing homes will be able to charge. The average fee in hostels is around $26,000, but it can be as high as $88,000. On top of this, nursing home residents who are not full pensioners will be charged nursing home fees of up to $34 a day or $12,000 a year. This fee will be charged as soon as a person's income  goes $1 above the pension&hyphen;free area. Inevitably, many of these costs will fall to families of nursing home residents who are unable to meet them themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Maybe you have an elderly family member who is receiving care at home via the HACC program. They will be faced with much higher user fees for the first time as a result of this Howard budget. As I said before, the pensioner dental scheme has been axed. There are higher costs on access to hearing services and a total of three&hyphen;quarters of a billion dollars is being knocked off concessions for people on social security payments. This was sneakily done by the same John Howard who told us before the election that `the coalition <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5754"> will maintain all current Commonwealth concessions'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So on the one hand, yes, families will be getting some extra dollars from an initiative such as the family tax initiative and the private health insurance rebate. But no Australian should be dazzled by those dollar signs. If your family depends on public health or public education services or if it is dependent on child care or if you have someone in TAFE or at university in your family or you have a family member in a nursing home or if you are trying to get back into the work force, you will not have those extra dollars long enough to even realise you had them, let alone enjoy them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said as I commenced my contribution on this debate on the appropriation bills, you have to keep your eye on the total of the take. That is the trick from Mr Howard and his government. I am pleased to say that he is slowly but surely being exposed on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As an opposition we have made our position on the budget measures very clear. We are vigorously opposed to measures which betray election promises&mdash;as we have said many times in this chamber, there are very many of them in this budget of deceit&mdash;which infringe equity or detract from national savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have identified a very significant range of measures which fall into one or more of those categories. These are set out in general terms in the second reading amendment which has been circulated in the chamber. I give notice that I will move it at the conclusion of my speech in the second reading debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition will also be seeking to have Appropriation Bill (No. 1) and Appropriation Bill (No. 2) amended to reinstate vital programs which the government proposes to cut or to restore funding in other programs to the levels budgeted for by the former Labor government. These requests for amendments will be circulated shortly. Obviously, they will be moved at the committee stage of the debate on these bills. They will give this callous and vindictive government a last opportunity to reconsider the consequences of the impacts of some of these extraordinarily harsh budget measures.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that senators will take the opportunity that is offered by the second reading amendment that I will move on behalf of the opposition and by the requests to amendments that will be moved at a later stage to demonstrate the Senate's support&mdash;like the Labor Party's&mdash;for a fair go for all Australians.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The appropriation bills we are debating are special ones. Unlike other ones, they have a particular place in the constitutional structure of our nation through their intrinsic link to the concept of supply. We all well remember 1975 and the forcing of the constitutional crisis by the Liberal and National parties. I will not forget it. I do not want it to happen again. It is very destructive and should not be recreated. This why Democrat senators have pledged not to bring down a government in this way despite some of the disgusting things this government does in the name of policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We make no apologies for our ongoing commitment to stability of government. Our pledge not to block supply does not stop us though from requesting amendments to the appropriation bills, as I made very clear in my budget address&hyphen;in&hyphen;reply on 22 August when I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a tactic we intend to use with the clear and specific aim of putting pressure on Government backbenchers in marginal seats to stand up and be counted on the most damaging aspects of the budget.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what we are doing today and I hope that we receive the support of the majority of senators. We would all be aware that coalition backbenchers&mdash;particularly new members of parliament&mdash;would not have had input into the structure of the budget. In many respects, they would not even have known the fine detail of the budget any earlier than the rest of us. I hope they would have been horrified, as most of us were, with what we have called `the death of a thousand cuts' contained in the budget. So by initiating requests today, the Democrats and the Labor Party have shown that they are doing that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats will be giving these backbenchers&mdash;as I say, many are in marginal seats and are new members&mdash;an opportunity to reflect on the structure and impact of this budget, and to take personal responsibility for either imposing or lifting these cuts on some of the most vulnerable members of our community, normal human beings who live in their electorates. Let these backbenchers answer to their electors for their personal responsibility, not in regard to the architecture <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the budget but in the voting for the implementation of these measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats have identified a representative basket of issues within our requests. It covers Aboriginal Australians, the poor, regional development, the environment, the unemployed and public broadcasting. Specifically, through our requests we will be seeking to restore ATSIC funding, maintain ABC funding in real terms, restore funding to the Commonwealth dental scheme, restore the NEIS program, restore previous commitments to the development of the emerging ethanol industry and restore funding to the Daintree rescue package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, we will be supporting some of the other requests which have been foreshadowed by the Labor Party. A number of my colleagues will be speaking briefly in the committee stage of this debate to highlight some of the unnecessarily harsh measures. Senator Bourne will speak on the ABC, Senator Allison on the dental health scheme and Senator Woodley on ethanol.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To keep my comments brief, I am just going to comment on the NEIS program, on cuts to the environment programs and on cuts to ATSIC. We hear a lot about the predicament of the unemployed. I said on budget night that this budget was built on the backs of the unemployed. I genuinely believe that to be the case. I think the government acknowledges this; that is why the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has set up his special subcommittee to coordinate across&hyphen;department policies to deal with unemployment. We hope it works but the point is that it comes after the architecture of a budget which specifically chose to put the burdens of the future on the unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has said that most labour market programs are being cashed in because the percentage of positive outcomes from these programs is far too low. The government has said that funding for many labour market programs is being slashed because the programs have failed to deliver `real jobs'&mdash;that is, the government's view of `real jobs'&mdash;for the unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is also slashing funding for one labour market program which we <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5757"> think was highly successful&mdash;the new enterprise initiative scheme. It is a program which has created some 20,000 new businesses over the past 10 years and has consistently achieved positive outcomes&mdash;close to 84 per cent. But in this scorched earth, ideological, 20 per cent on everything approach to this budget, this government chooses to single out something which has a success rate of 84 per cent to slash funding to. We do not believe that the decision to do this&mdash;it amounts to a 17 per cent cut&mdash;makes any sense at all. There is not any justification for slashing funding for such a highly successful employment program when 8.7 per cent of Australians cannot find a job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The NEIS scheme was an example that the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) pointed to in his speech last Friday. When he talked about employment opportunities for indigenous Australians, he pointed to the NEIS scheme. I wondered at the time whether the minister for Aboriginal affairs actually knew the government had said, `Well, we are going to slash funding to this scheme by 17 per cent.' It is a successful scheme. Obviously cross&hyphen;department integration is not working yet, because one minister is saying, `Here is a good example of how we can promote Aboriginal employment,' but the Treasurer (Mr Costello) is saying, `Yes, but we're going to cut funds to this program.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On environmental matters, there have been several important buyback and protection schemes which have been reduced from existing levels under the budget this year, and I am requesting the government to top them up to their former levels of funding. Specifically, the government has decided to drop the amounts for the Daintree rescue scheme and the Sugar Coast rescue package, which was put in place to save the mahogany glider and other creatures in danger of extinction as a result of the expansion of the sugar industry. When we asked the government about this, it said that the promised amounts of money would eventually be met&mdash;however, it would take a longer period of time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very difficult to predict when blocks of land will go on the market and for how much. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> The blocks of land have been mostly identified and, if there are major blocks to come on the market for the joint Commonwealth-Queensland buyback schemes, it is very hard to say to a vendor, `Hang on. Wait until the budget in 1997 or 1998, when we have the next little bit of money to devote to this rescue package.' It does not work like that. So saying, `Oh, we're going to do it eventually,' is an absolute cop&hyphen;out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the wet tropics, funding for the world heritage management is $9.8 million. Yet in this overall pot, when divided up amongst Australia's areas, funding for the wet tropics has declined from $4 million to $2.8 million. We would just like to bring this back to the $4 million mark from the last budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for the Environment, Senator Hill, pointed out in the Senate on Tuesday that the wet tropics management plan is near finalisation. He said that the authority desperately needs money for management and for threat abatement work. What are they doing? They are cutting their budget by 40 per cent. Aren't we supposed to make these policy interconnections? Aren't we supposed to say, `Yes, good on you for giving priority to the Wet Tropics Management Authority. PS&mdash;Hang on, we won't take any notice of how you are reducing their capacity to implement this policy by cutting their funding by 40 per cent.' We believe the size of this cut to the budget&mdash;the 40 per cent cut to the budget&mdash;will make their work almost impossible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, our three requests in the environment area constitute an upkeep of protection and purchase for important places in North Queensland&mdash;places which are extremely important for endangered species.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the restoration of ATSIC funding, I think particularly relevant is the context of the recent and ongoing race debate in this country. Yes, we have focused on the need to address disadvantage, only I think we differ on how mainstream the addressing of that disadvantage has to be. As a result of the cuts to ATSIC, we saw health, employment programs and native title quarantined to some extent. We saw ATSIC's decision as a result of being told, `You'll have to cut your budget by this amount.' We saw the cuts that were <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5758"> made to youth programs, heritage and environment programs, women's programs, legal services&mdash;and that is particularly worrying&mdash;art, culture and language programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not see the delivery of services in indigenous areas as simply being about citizenship rights, and that is why I have always thought it necessary to address the wider issue of disadvantage in the broader ways. The contribution of women's programs and legal services to Senator Herron's concepts of self-empowerment cannot be underestimated. The publicity that surrounded the cuts to legal services in indigenous areas has highlighted the fact that indigenous views may not be represented or may be insufficiently represented. That is not acceptable. ATSIC needs every dollar that it had relied on in the past year to do its work properly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not walk away from comments on the need for auditing; I do not walk away from communities being identified as having to review some of their processes, but the bottom line of all of this is about addressing disadvantage and working towards reconciliation. I think a $474 million cut to ATSIC's budget makes a huge dent in achieving those two worthy aims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I imagine you will hear the Treasurer carrying on about what the Senate is seeking to do. I imagine we will be told, `This is irresponsible; you are breaking the budget. You can't do this to my deficit reduction strategy. It is sacrosanct.' Let me get in ahead of him. The requests being sought by the Democrats total $171 million for this year. This will not break the budget. It is one-eighth of one per cent of the total $136 billion in our budget. It will not do anything to interest rates, either. It will not affect our credit rating, either.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, it is well within the usual estimation forecast error parameters&mdash;the ones we have seen in the past, $1 billion here and there. A one per cent error on prices inflation, for example, would increase or reduce outlays by $400 million. I am talking about $171 million that I want this government to review and restore. There would be a fall in unemployment recipients. Say labour market programs did work, say NEIS was allowed to keep <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> operating the way it used to; a fall in unemployment of just 40,000&mdash;five per cent&mdash;would change the budget by $300 million. But more importantly, if this government were willing to review its decision and to reverse some of the meanest and most unfair of these cuts in the name of the fiscal responsibility that they are saying they are taking for Australia&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it is important, Senator Kemp, but it is how you achieve it that is important and the pace at which you achieve it that is important. If the government were to reverse these cuts, the harm done to sectors of the Australian community&mdash;to indigenous Australians, to rural Australia, to the unemployed, to the sick, to the environment&mdash;could be avoided.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I heard Noel Pearson talking about indigenous affairs on radio this morning. He was talking about guilt. He said that it is not about guilt, it is about having a bit of a heart. That is what has got to happen in this budget. We have got to stop thinking about these numbers on paper, and think about the people that are affected by these cuts. The government tells us we can rely on families benefiting from interest rate cuts, but what benefit is an interest rate cut to a family who cannot afford to buy its own house? What benefit is there for indigenous families, the chronically sick or the unemployed? They fit into this category.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1996 budget was not a fair or balanced budget. It pursued obsessive contractionary policy. Its pain was targeted too heavily at those who could not afford to pay. I do not care whether the headlines the next day said, `This is a good budget.' It might be if you are comfortable. But as this budget unravels we will see where the pain falls. If the government is concerned about maintaining this excessive level of fiscal tightening, then it has the other option of alternative revenue raising proposals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Take Premier Jeff Kennett's advice. Let us start talking about tax reform which includes alternative revenue raising proposals. We suggested tighter targeting of the family tax rebate using the same means test used for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5759"> family payments, to deny the payment to high income families. That would have saved $100 million just yesterday when we were debating that bill. A 20 per cent cut in the totally unjustified diesel fuel rebate would, for example, completely pay for all the requests we are making. It was appalling, in the budget context, that the preservation of this subsidy to some of Australia's richest companies, this $800 million handout, was announced on the same day as massive cuts to ATSIC&mdash;cuts felt by some of our poorest and most disadvantaged families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is those kinds of decisions which reflect the priorities of this government&mdash;maintain the diesel fuel subsidy in full; do not think about phasing it out a little bit, do not ask about its inefficiencies, which have been highlighted in auditor's reports. No, the priorities of this government are the excessive devotion to fiscal tightening and the pursuit of the dollar, well ahead of the needs of many vulnerable Australian families&mdash;maybe some of the battlers that the government thinks it has won over. But it will not keep them if we are successful in highlighting the decisions and the priorities that have been made by this government with respect to the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to finish by quoting from parts of a letter by Robert Fitzgerald, the president of ACOSS. Again, it anticipates some of the responses that the Treasurer is likely to make. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . these few positive features&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>in the budget&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">are massively outweighed by the negative. We share the Democrats' criticism of the unnecessarily rapid deficit elimination strategy chosen by the government, especially as it relies so overwhelmingly on the expenditure side of the equation to reach its target. Expenditure cuts contribute approximately three&hyphen;quarters to the task, while revenue raising measures contribute only one&hyphen;quarter . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is why we say this budget is unbalanced&mdash;three&hyphen;quarters of cuts and one&hyphen;quarter for addressing ways to raise revenue. He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The pace and method of deficit reduction adopted by the government in this Budget will cause severe social hardship and is very likely to be counter&hyphen;productive in economic terms. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>ACOSS calculates that at least 30 per cent of the expenditure savings over the next two years will affect mainly low income people. Further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many of these people are single and . . . will receive no relief from the family tax initiative . . . most low income families will not be fully compensated for the effect of these expenditure cuts and service reductions on their disposable incomes.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is certainly not a fair budget. In fact, in my opinion, it is a great deal worse than the 1993 budget. It is unfair, and its cuts are certainly targeted to those people who have the least ability to fight back. They are the people who already have the least power in our society and to whom, over time, as a caring community, there has been assistance given in various ways. There has been not just assistance but commonsense programs to provide the means by which our community can do what communities are supposed to do; that is, build on the strengths within the community. Often, those strengths are community self-help, the ability to survive and live in the future and the ability to provide those things that are basic to human existence. It seems that basic decency has been left out of these measures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will give one example. In education, something like $65 million has been taken out of government schools and given to non-government schools. We are taking money from the public sector and giving it to the private sector. You could call it the reverse Robin Hood syndrome. The Greens (WA) are very concerned; we have been right from the beginning of this budget. In March, we talked about the concern regarding the continued focus on one side of the balance sheet. What we are seeing is not good economic management. We are seeing an ideological push for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5760"> minimalist government. This is a philosophical underpinning to the government's response to the deficit problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is really quite interesting that there are a couple of deficits. There is the balance of payments deficit and the budget deficit. Many commentators say that what will have more effect on the economy is the balance of payments or trade deficit. But we are not admitting that we have industry and trade policies that are not even seriously looking at that issue. The only thing the government is doing is cutting government spending. It is also cutting taxes, where possible. It is keeping taxes down and trying to compete internationally to see who can have the lowest taxes within the region to attract investment. It is cutting environmental standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we have seen in the last couple of days, the government has been trying to put downward pressure on wages and conditions. In the words of the government via the principal object of their industrial relations bill&mdash;I will not call it a workplace reform bill; reform means a change for the better, and that bill is not&mdash;it is for international competitiveness and flexibility. Read that as the pushing down of wages and conditions so that we can attract investment. This government has added to what was done in the last government by destroying much of the ability of large parts of Australian industry to meet basic needs in Australia, such as food, clothing and shelter. It does not take people in their stores much to see what the structural changes are. They have been made worse by poor or negative government policy that does not recognise that the push for, and blind faith in, internationalism and the international free market are not getting us where anybody thought they wanted to go, at least not where I thought the major members of the community thought they wanted to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In April this year, we talked about the government's push to pursue big budget cuts in a lot of areas to do with social justice while leaving defence spending untouched. It highlighted the ideologically driven approach. Yet EPAC surveys indicate that taxpayers are willing to pay more taxes to get the services they want. They do not want more user pays <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> services. They believe that their taxes should be spent on such things as the environment and on social services such as health and education. If they thought there was any area that we could spend less on, it was defence. That is why we will be endeavouring to make requests in this bill in relation to major areas, such as education, health and social security, and other areas, such as the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is extremely important that people see what this budget really is. It is not good financial management. It is very narrow management. It is a blinkered approach to what is important. What this government is saying is important is an ideological and, in my view, irrational view about the international free market, although ironically within the coalition we sometimes have more doubters than we have seen from previous ministers in some of the Labor government portfolios. It is a blinkered approach not only to the benefits of the international free market but also to what is happening in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much of what is passed in this budget for budget austerity measures is actually a very thinly disguised excuse for rapid privatisation and a rapid reduction in the provision of social services. In that sense, there is a rapid reduction in accountability and buck passing. Along with that comes a rapid increase in potential conflicts of interest, such as when we have commercial operations involved with the traditional role of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are at a very serious time in our history. This budget will unravel as we deal with each of the measures. The reason for that is that those groups and people who will be most targeted will not even see the impacts until they are very clearly in front of them. We will be seeing a great deal of community hurt. Unfortunately, very little real information has been given to people about the likely impacts on them. I know for sure that we will be seeing enclaves of disadvantage getting worse. I can tell you for sure that we will have debates in relation to law and order in the states and in this parliament when we begin to see the social disruption between the haves and have nots that deliberate policies of differentiation will create in Australia.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5761">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We give billions of dollars annually to corporations. Absentee corporate heavies get billions of dollars worth of taxpayers' welfare every year in Australia. Yet we cut from the most vulnerable; we cut from the bottom. I am very sad to see that, because of the government's program mismanagement, they thought it was more necessary to do some nah nah nahs on industrial relations this week rather than give us a proper chance to debate the most important issues in relation to this budget and these appropriations. I do not think that is appropriate and I do not think it is the way to be handling the program. I do not think that making political points is more important than the real impacts of Australia's budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I obviously believe that debate on industrial relations was very important, but the government are now saying that we have to contract this debate and the proper consideration of the appropriations debate because the House of Representatives is not here next week and it forgot that we needed to have it by the end of November. First of all, we need to ask which departments are likely to run out of money. We need to find out why it was not considered important enough for us to rearrange the program so that we could deal with appropriations on Monday or Tuesday. The world was not going to end if, by Tuesday, the industrial relations bill was still on the program. However, that was not the decision that was made. That speaks volumes for the political strategies of this government and it speaks volumes for their priorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are issues that are important in the Australian economy, and those issues in my opinion are how you meet the needs of people in our society; how you create economies, especially in regional areas, which are truly sustainable; and how you look at appropriate economies which look at the real issues in our society like resources, energy, greenhouse production and the basic human social needs of the people in our society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> I have not seen any recognition at all that these issues are important to this government. I have not seen any recognition at all of the fact that they need to find out what a reasonable government&mdash;a responsible govern ment&mdash;needs to raise in terms of revenue. What they have done is decide to cut and slash as much as possible at the same time as trying to pull down taxes. I do not believe that is responsible, and I do not believe that that is what the average taxpayer wants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The average taxpayer wants a fair go. They do not want to see measures which make the rich richer and the poor poorer. They do not want to see measures which basically deny human dignity in our society in 1996.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has justified every one of its cuts on the basis that it has a substantial deficit which has to be reduced. Yet, when you look at the issue of the ABC and the cuts to the ABC and the way they were gone about, these cuts are not done on the basis of reducing the deficit. That is a side issue for this government. These cuts are there for a political purpose&mdash;to destroy the effectiveness of the ABC as a major broadcaster and telecaster in Australia.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5762">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cuts are absolutely savage. That was the word used by Mr Johns, the chief executive of the ABC, when they were announced. In this year's budget, the cuts are $11 million, which is basically the so-called 2&half; per cent efficiency dividend applied to all agencies. That is just on $11 million out of the 1996-97 budget. The next cuts&mdash;the real cuts; the ones that really will go about destroying the ABC as we know it&mdash;which will occur in the following three years, are $55 million a year out of the ABC's budget. That is the most savage cut to the ABC in its history.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Carr quite rightly points out, that is a $209 million cut to the ABC over the next four years. It is unprecedented in the history of the ABC that such cuts are being applied.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All governments from time to time have asked the ABC to make efficiencies and said that the ABC's wish list for an increase in its budget may not be able to be met. At times, various governments have frozen increases. But no government, as far as I am aware&mdash;not even when the famous Sir Henry Bland was appointed by Mr Fraser, then Prime Minister, in the mid-1970s&mdash;has tried to do over the ABC, so to speak. Even at that stage I do not believe the funding went down. There may have been a freezing of the level of funding but there was no actual reduction. Not even Malcolm Fraser got into the actual reduction of the money for the ABC, even though he put Sir Henry Bland there as chairman to try to fix up the ABC to be more ideologically sympathetic, I suppose, to Mr Fraser's viewpoint.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But this new government has gone a step further. It is reducing the amount of money. The government is not just freezing it&mdash;not just getting rid of the price deflator, allowing for an increase even under inflation, freezing it at that level&mdash;the government is reducing it in real terms by $209 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a complete contradiction to the promises made by this government in January and February of this year during the election campaign. I know Senator Alston gets sick and tired of having this quoted at him, but it <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ought to be quoted at him every day while he remains minister. In his better communications policy statement of 18 January, he said, `The coalition will maintain existing levels of Commonwealth funding to the ABC.' Further, in that same document, he said, `The coalition will maintain the current prohibition on advertising and sponsorship on ABC television and radio.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Alston was one of the commentators on election night. After it was clear that the coalition had won the election and Senator Alston would be the new communications minister, he was asked on ABC television by Jim Middleton about ABC funding. Senator Alston said that funding would be maintained absolutely. Jim Middleton asked, `Even if you find the deficit is bigger than you expected, will the funding be maintained?' Senator Alston said, `Absolutely. John Howard has made it clear that we will meet all our promises, and the ABC is part of that promise.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Subsequently, when the ABC was before us in the estimates hearing in the latter part of this year, I asked Senator Alston about these promises and about his remarks on election night. He passed this off by saying that his remarks should be excused because the euphoria of the occasion meant that they should not be taken quite as he had said them.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="CARR" NAMEID="AW5">

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right, Senator Carr. He said, `euphoria'. I asked, `Is this a new generic term for being drunk or drinking too much champagne?' Even if he had been celebrating too much, one would have thought that he would have had the wit to qualify that question that was put to him in black and white terms by Jim Middleton on two occasions. He did not. He said, `The euphoria of the occasion may have led some remarks being generously given.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point is that he is on the record. He and the government have now broken that promise completely. It is one of the more outrageous breaches of promise that Senator Alston and the government have made. One should remember that last year Senator Alston chaired a Senate committee that looked at the ABC and found that the ABC was well <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5763"> managed and doing a very good job. There was nothing in that report by the committee, chaired by Senator Alston, that would lead anyone to say that Senator Alston, as minister, would cut $209 million out of the budget of the ABC over the next four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite clear from the evidence now on the record that Mr Howard, since becoming Prime Minister, has criticised the ABC as being too politically correct and has said that we hear too much about Aboriginal affairs issues and other minority views on the ABC. That is John Howard's comment. Mr Costello made similar remarks when he released the audit report earlier this year. So we have on the public record Mr Howard and Mr Costello, the two most significant figures in this government, directly attacking the ABC. They have made these cuts for a political outcome: to reduce the effectiveness of the ABC to be a broad based comprehensive broadcaster in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The irony is that, if you look at any of the surveys over the years, you will find that overwhelmingly in many areas the people who listen to the ABC are coalition supporters. In rural Australia the regional ABC network is overwhelmingly listened to by people who overwhelmingly vote for the coalition. Even in relation to the major metropolitan ABC radio stations&mdash;5AN in my state, 3LO in Melbourne, 2BL in Sydney, et cetera&mdash;the demographics of the listeners of those stations are that they are overwhelmingly Liberal voters. So any charge of the ABC being biased is extraordinary when consistently it is Liberal voters who are listening to the ABC. The majority of the audience are Liberal voters, so this charge of bias in the ABC is extraordinary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We just have to accept that this is a political act. It is not a financial matter. It is just an excuse to achieve a political end. In relation to Appropriation Bill (No. 1), we will be moving a request to the House of Representatives to restore the $11 million to the ABC funding this year. I cannot move the same amendment to restore the $55 million because that relates to next year's budget. Unless this government sees some commonsense about the ABC&mdash;and let us hope that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the government can learn from its mistake and restore the funding to the ABC in next year's budget&mdash;it is going to be condemned as destroying one of the great national broadcasters in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I find extraordinary is that Senator Alston has admitted he has received 17,000 letters, or thereabouts, of protest about cuts to the ABC. In the estimates hearing, he said that several thousand of those were pro&hyphen;forma letters. But the majority were letters people had actually taken the trouble to write themselves to express their view. During my time in this parliament I do not think a minister has received so many genuine letters of concern from the Australian public on any issue&mdash;17,000 letters, of which a majority are not pro&hyphen;forma but genuinely written by people expressing their own view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time as Senator Alston received 17,000 letters, he received 60 letters complaining about the ABC's coverage of the gay mardi gras in Sydney. He wrote an extraordinary letter to the ABC demanding that they reconsider the coverage or delay the telecast et cetera because 60 people had written to him. He actually used that as an excuse to write to the management of the ABC. He gets 17,000 letters and does nothing. Sixty versus 17,000&mdash;it really does show the imbalance in this minister's attitude towards what he thinks is public opinion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think, in the end, this new government will face the music over what they are doing to the ABC because it is overwhelmingly ABC supporters in rural and regional Australia who are upset. The issue about regional Australia&mdash;and I come from a small state&mdash;is really important. There is no doubt that the $11 million cuts being imposed&mdash;not the $55 million; that's next year's business&mdash;have already reduced the operation of metropolitan ABC radio. In each state some of the best and well&hyphen;known radio announcers have been sacked or forced off air as programs are being merged to make savings&mdash;this is from $11 million. What is going to happen to the ABC next year when they have to take $55 million out? We know what will happen. Some radio networks will be closed down completely. Regional Australia will be networked out of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5764"> Sydney and Melbourne. It will be impossible for the regional network to survive when you take $55 million out of budget over the subsequent three years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government have been utterly duplicitous in what they have done to the ABC. What they promised in the election was utterly different from what they are carrying out in their political witch&hyphen;hunt and ideological drive, as they see the unpleasantness of some issue which they do not like being broadcast on the ABC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party is committed to support the ABC with its comprehensive charter as a broad based, national broadcaster providing services to all Australians, whether it be Triple J for the young people of Australia, whether it is the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Country Hour</EMPHASIS> for farmers to get information about farming issues, whether it is regional Australia to get local community news, whether it is the ABC FM fine music station, whether it is the national second network, whether it is the ABC metropolitan stations or whether it is ABC television, the drama production, which is about $50 million a year. These cuts are more than the total money spent by the ABC in one year on television drama, on Australian content. That could all go in one hit by trying to meet these savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, this government are being utterly duplicitous in what they are trying to do to the ABC. In the end, I do not think they will succeed because the reaction on this issue from ordinary Australians of all political persuasions has been ferocious. Seventeen thousand letters to a minister on any issue is unparalleled in my time in this parliament. I encourage the Australian citizenry to be as strong as ever in demanding of their Liberal and National Party members of parliament the preservation of the ABC as a comprehensive, broad based, national broadcaster.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to conclude on the other area of my portfolio responsibility, the issue of Telstra. At some time in the next couple of weeks I presume the government will finally bring back on the list the debate about the privatisation of Telstra. Over the last couple of weeks the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), in particular, has said the Senate has been <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> holding up the government's legislative program, including the Telstra privatisation debate. Yet it is the government in this place that will not put it on the list to be debated. It is not on the red sheet for today.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You could have had the debate two weeks ago. The debate on the second reading could have been completed and a vote taken on the privatisation of Telstra. The reason the government keep putting this off is that they are not certain of the outcome of the vote in the Senate and they still want to try to convince some senators to vote for their proposition. They have certainly not replied to Senator Harradine's proposal about a preferential share issue to raise the $8 billion dollars. Who knows when they will reply to that? Let us put it at rest. The opposition are not delaying the debate about the privatisation of Telstra; the government are delaying the debate because they are still trying to work out a way to convince the majority of the Senate to vote for it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the year just gone, Telstra paid a dividend, after tax, to the federal government of $1,368 million, after they withheld some profit for reinvestment in capital works, et cetera. I want to point out to the Senate that this is not an insignificant sum in the revenue of Australia. When you look at the revenue raised through taxation, you find that the dividend from Telstra alone is greater than the money the Australian government received from the withholding tax which was $1.349 billion. It was greater than the petroleum resource rental tax which was $791 million. It was greater than the capital gains tax which, for the previous year&mdash;only preliminary figures are available for 1994&hyphen;95&mdash;was $965 million. So the dividend which Telstra pays to the federal government is greater than the withholding tax, it is greater than the petroleum resource rental tax, and it is greater than the capital gains tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If, as the minister says is inevitable, the whole of Telstra will be privatised, the question I put to the government is: where are you going to make up the $1.3 billion of revenue that is now being paid as dividend to the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5765"> government and which is more than three other taxes which we collect individually? It is a significant amount of revenue. Ordinary Australians would say, `Perhaps you might privatise something that is losing money and costing us money to keep going, but why would you sell a business that is paying more revenue than three other taxes on the revenue base of Australia?' That is a question which the government ought to answer in this debate on the appropriation bills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I look forward to the minister, Senator Alston, making a comment about that, or even Senator Kemp, who represents the Treasurer in this chamber. How will the minister make up the revenue loss of $1.3 billion a year when he fully privatises Telstra? Where is he going to make it up? Which taxes is he going to put up to make up $1.3 billion? What further cuts will he make to government expenditure and programs to make up $1.3 billion?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I concur with the sentiments that Senator Schacht has just expressed. At the outset, I want to talk about the doctrinaire philosophy and the economic fundamentalism which underride this budget. It is the wrong way for this country to be going. It is going to lead to an increasing divide between the haves and the have nots in a country which has prided itself on its egalitarianism, on its ethic of a fair go.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> This is about nation splitting. It is going to lead us in the American direction, where the gap between the haves and the have nots is writ large for anybody who wants to walk the streets of any of the major cities to see people <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> who are panhandling and begging. There are 35 million people living below the poverty line, while there is one per cent of people living in extreme and obscene wealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are going to have a bonded society in the future, we have to lay down the prescription for that now. Instead of laying down that prescription for a fairer, more equal society, where everybody has an opportunity for personal fulfilment, it has to be done now with future generations in mind. You cannot have this doctrinaire economic fundamentalism which says, `Leave society to the law of the jungle, divest parliament of powers and translate them across to the stock exchange,' and at the same time have a fair go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After the federal budget, 114 of Australia's economists made a statement about the government's economic policy. The statement reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The federal government's commitment to reduce expenditure by $8 billion is economically irresponsible. Expenditure cuts of that magnitude will inevitably cause job losses&mdash;directly in the public sector and indirectly in the private sector as a result of the downward multiplier effects. There is a strong possibility of precipitating a substantial economic recession.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The goal of a balanced budget indicates pre-Keynesian economic thinking. It ignores the creative role which fiscal policy can play in economic management, especially in tackling unemployment. Moreover, the expenditure cuts would likely fail to produce a balanced budget anyway, because the consequence reduction in jobs and incomes would result in lower tax revenues being generated in the next fiscal year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More attention needs to be given to the role of government expenditure on repairing the nation's run&hyphen;down infrastructure, creating jobs and fostering industry and regional development. If necessary, increased taxation and other revenue options should be under consideration. Savage expenditure cuts are economically irresponsible and socially damaging.</PARA>
<PARA>This statement was sponsored by Associate Professor Frank Stilwell from the Department of Economics at the University of Sydney, by Emeritus Professor John Neville from the Department of Economics at the University of New South Wales, by Professor John Quiggin from the Department of Economics at the James Cook University and by Dr Phil O'Hara from the Department of Economics at <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5766"> Curtin University, and was supported by 110 other economists around the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the feeling that the government is going in the wrong direction is not just a political expression. It is not just a feeling of disappointment by those who want to see more money going in their direction in Australian society. It is a very strongly felt academic and analytic viewpoint from people who do not hold the government's doctrinaire economic fundamentalist viewpoint.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, I want to point to some of the specific implications of this budget, which we are debating here today under the government's suddenly found panic button, which says that if we do not get it through today we will run out of money because the House of Representatives is not sitting next week as the Prime Minister is away. Whatever the case, the government has just spent a huge amount of Senate time pushing through its industrial relations legislation. That bill had priority over the budget as far as this government was concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One cannot help thinking that this panic button approach to discussing the budget is simply a way of truncating and stifling that debate. The government has been able to stifle the full debate on the budget in the public arena. It has successfully got away with that, and it is getting away with it today because of the truncation of this debate. It should have been a matter being debated before the industrial relations legislation, which quite clearly does not have the relevant urgency that this legislation has for the whole nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn back to some specifics. I am going to apply some of these to Tasmania and to challenge the Tasmanian government senators opposite to get up and defend the impact that the budgetary measures they are shoving through here today&mdash;their cutting and slashing left, right and centre&mdash;will have on Tasmania, the island state.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Calvert sits over there waggling his finger as he cuts millions out of the Tasmanian budgetary allocation, as he cuts into the welfare of every <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Tasmanian by aiding and supporting the government on these matters. Let me put some of those to Senator Calvert, who is the only other Tasmanian senator in the Senate at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, we have the abolition of the Commonwealth dental health program. There is a national cut of $56 million in the next fiscal year. The estimate for Tasmania is that $1.6 million will be slashed out of that program. That is going to hit 15,000 Tasmanians, including elderly Tasmanians, each year from now on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let Senator Calvert explain to those 15,000 Tasmanians why he supports the government's cut to this very successful dental health program, which they have access to. The cuts he is voting for will, of course, result in increased waiting lists and fewer people being able to have access to dental health.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The homeless kids Austudy incidentals allowance is being abolished. This is a pathetic measure by this government. The national cut will be $3 million in the next year. The estimated cut for Tasmania is $54,300. People might say that that is not much when we are looking at a budget of more than $100 billion, but let us look at the individuals who are affected in the state which has got the highest unemployment rate in the country&mdash;an unemployment rate which is going to be substantially increased by the measures which the Tasmanian Liberal senators are voting for in this budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">About 180 homeless youth in Tasmania receive Austudy. The allowance involved here was a one-off payment of $300 at the beginning of the year for expenses such as books, equipment and course costs for kids who do not have family backup, who might otherwise be on the streets and who want to get a secondary education so they can go on to tertiary education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This allowance was to help them get books, rulers and equipment so they can go to school the same as other kids who have got the backing that they do not have. It is aimed at allowing them to have an education so they will get a job further down the line and will not be on the scrap heap.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5767">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are the Tasmanian Liberal senators voting for? They are voting to take from those kids that measly $300. That is going to lead to some of those kids failing. That will be the difference between whether they succeed&mdash;whether they make the grade against all the odds&mdash;or whether they fail. Quite clearly, those Liberal senators opposite do not care. I do not think they understand the situation that those kids are in with all its complexity, all its hardships and everything that is against them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But here is a measly $300 specifically allocated to get them a start up again in education and to help them make that positive decision, and these Liberal senators are voting to cut it out. That says a lot for their concern for the have-nots in our society. That says a lot for their concern for the unemployed. That says a lot for the heartlessness of this budget, which is going to pull the rug from under kids like that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another measure in this budget is a $30 million cut to the job program in Tasmania. The national cut is over half a billion dollars. There will be cuts to the LEAP, the jobskills and the new work opportunities programs, and they will lead to a loss of 3,623 placements in Tasmania. The government says, of course, `We are moving towards a private enterprise situation. We will put it to the employers themselves and we will divest government of the responsibility for helping people get a start up. We will cut the previous, successful Labor programs to ribbons and, in doing so, we will cut nearly 4,000 jobs.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what has the government got? It has a special employer support program, which will create some 800 jobs in the green corps&mdash;great name. It may attract some good, positive publicity to paper over what it is doing. It is the green wash brush out again. While the opportunity to get back into the workplace through reskilling will be taken from 3,623 people, including long&hyphen;term unemployed, this green corps proposal out of the government's public relations machine is going to create seven to 10 job placements in Tasmania. So they are slashing 3,623 jobs and putting seven jobs back.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we get to the cuts to the ABC&mdash;$209 million over the next four years. Pro rata that is a $7 million cut out of Tasmania where the ABC's listening audience is greater than anywhere else in the country. The ABC rates high because it gives current affairs coverage second to none. It rates high because it gives talkback, not available elsewhere on commercial radio. It rates high because Tasmania is a regional community without the metropolitan weighting that you have in the mainland states, and it covers the interests of regional and rural communities in a way that commercial radio simply does not and will not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet the ABC is having its budget massively slashed because the government does not control the editorial content of the ABC&mdash;nor does anybody else. It is that very independence that a Liberal government should be standing up for that is being punished by these budget cuts, which are going to quite unduly and unfairly affect Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A range of amendments have been flagged here today from the Labor Party, the Democrats and in particular the Western Australian Greens Senator Dee Margetts. I will be supporting those that move to redress the impact of this savage budget on Australians, particularly those who are vulnerable, those whom <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5768"> the Prime Minister said he was going to protect and those who are going to be extraordinarily disadvantaged by the cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might say that it is not just the cuts that are worrying. It is also the pouring of advantage across to the silvertails, to the Stock Exchange-led component of Australian life. Let us look at the diesel fuel rebate and support that being kept for the farmers and hospitals and so on. But how can you endorse the government handover in one year alone of $800 million to the big mining corporations, a return of their properly paid tax on fuel usage, with these savage cuts? How can that be justified except as a gift to the already wealthy, to the haves, to the people who are able to wield power on weak-kneed politicians and get their pockets lined at the expense of poorer people in our society? This year, the government is handing BHP, the big Australian, a cheque for $80 million on a silver platter at a time when it cannot find the money to give $300 to kids who simply want to buy books and go back to high school. That is the heartlessness of this budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After that, we look at the government's much touted effort to catch tax avoiders. Each year, $800 million is forgone there. They say they have a program in place to catch up $100 million of that this year. There is another $700 million&mdash;wrongly, I submit&mdash;going to tax avoiders at the big end of town at a time when this government cannot find $300 to give to kids who want to get back into school.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is no wonder there are only two government members opposite to defend the situation that this budget will put Australians into. It is no wonder there is so little support in this place for this bill that the government is wanting to rush through the Senate today on the pretext that it is too late to have a bigger debate, that it is too late to allow a more wide-ranging debate because the House of Representatives will not be sitting next week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Schacht said, $1.3 billion is to be forgone if only the government can get through its legislation to flog off Telstra. That is $1.3 billion in perpetuity. That is $1.3 billion that is going to have to be found through future tax increases or, more likely <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> with this government's split and divide attitude to the community, through further cuts to education, health, community services and employment schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is only one word to describe this budget&mdash;heartless. There is only one phrase that really covers it well&mdash;divide. The whole ethos of this budget is to take more power from this place to work for the common good of the Australian people, and hand it across to the Stock Exchange so that the haves can continue to accrue, in their interest, the benefits of an economic direction which is economic fundamentalism, away from the egalitarian viewpoint that has been so much espoused as the Australian ethos.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(11.43 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to close the second reading debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) and Appropriation Bill (No. 2) which are before the chamber. This budget has been widely welcomed in the public arena and seen to be a fair budget. It has been extensively debated; probably more debated in the estimates committee procedure than any other budget that has come before this parliament. The opportunity for debate on this budget has been huge, Senator Brown. If you were not there to make your views known, I am sorry about that. Let me say to you that very many senators took the opportunity to take part in those estimates hearings, which, I think I am right in saying, were the longest in memory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget has been very extensively canvassed. It has been welcomed by the public. It is a dilemma for opposition senators and other non-government senators and Independents that this budget has been very widely welcomed by the public. We can recall that on the day after the budget a headline read `A fair go'. That summed up the way this budget was received in the public arena.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The unreality of what we are hearing in this debate is quite extraordinary. We have had the Lindsay by-election, we have had the estimates arrangements and we have had the very satisfactory consequence already flowing through from a responsible budget of pressure being taken off interest rates, which have <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5769"> come down substantially since the March election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I repeat: we will not be supporting the various requests which the opposition, the Democrats and, I think, the Greens will be proposing, although we have not seen amendments from the Greens. As far as I am aware, I think Senator Brown mentioned there are some amendments that the Greens are circulating, but we have not seen them. I checked just prior to standing and I notice that you refer to them in your remarks, but they have not been seen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The requests by the Labor Party would cut budget savings by, wait for it, $1 billion in 1996&hyphen;97. One is reminded of the famous old quote of the Bourbons which seems to relate also to the Labor Party&mdash;they have forgotten nothing and they have learnt nothing. They have not forgotten how to spend money and they have not learnt that it is important to be responsible and fiscally responsible. This $1 billion is before we learn what they wish to do in detail on the taxation front. This is just for starters, Senator Faulkner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were a number of issues raised, all of which have been very extensively canvassed over a long period of time and during the estimates process. I wish to make a few brief remarks on the importance of the budget and the appropriation bills in particular which should be passed in full.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget is a key element of putting Australia on a better path. We recognise that we had to make some tough decisions in this budget, but failing to act now would only make the decisions even tougher and more painful down the track. The facts are very stark. In the past five years the Commonwealth under the Labor Party amassed some $70 billion in deficits. In other words, they spent $70 billion more than they were prepared to raise. Commonwealth debt now stands at $100 billion. Our public interest bill is over $9 billion a year and is almost as much as the Commonwealth spends on defence and education. That, Senator Brown, is one of the consequences of overspending, which the previous government did with a vengeance. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This debt and interest burden is placed on all Australians and must ultimately be repaid by all Australians, including future generations. Passing this budget offers the Australian people a better way. It offers them less debt. It offers them lower interest rates. It offers them more jobs and better living standards over the medium term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most importantly, this budget is consistent with the promises we made to the Australian people when they elected us to office on 2 March. The budget makes good our promises on helping families, through the family tax initiative, providing incentives for private health insurance, helping small business by reducing the provisional tax uplift factor, providing the CGT rollover relief, and implementing the modern Australian apprenticeship and traineeship scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget has been endorsed by the people. It is one of the most popular budgets which has been brought down. As I said, that shows the unreality of so many of the comments which have been made in this debate so far. It is clear that the budget has been widely accepted by the Australian people. It is a fair&hyphen;go budget. The people want this government to be given a fair go. It is a budget which deserves the full support of the Senate. I commend the appropriation bills to the chamber.</PARA>

<PARA>The terms of this particular request have been circulated in the chamber. I say at the outset that I will not take up much of the committee's time on this request. From the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> opposition's perspective it is important that we honour the spirit of the changes that we introduced in government&mdash;and which in fact I introduced in my previous incarnation as <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Manager of Government Business&mdash;to the way that the appropriation bills are handled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I appreciate that it has become unusual since the adoption of these procedures for the bills to be debated in committee, but we are dealing here with an extraordinary situation. We have a budget which flouts the government's election commitments in so many areas and spreads the burden of the government's fiscal consolidation strategy to those who can least afford to bear it. It is those same disadvantaged members of the community whom this government gave an ironclad commitment&mdash;an ironclad promise&mdash;to protect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to put on the record the Labor Party's protest about the way in which the government has handled these bills. I want to draw on the comments which Senator Harradine has just made to the chamber. We are all aware that they have been on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> for weeks, in fact since 11 October. It was only last night that I received frantic information that the government had discovered that these bills had to be passed at all costs today. That might go part of the way to explaining why a number of opposition speakers who had intended to make a contribution to the second reading debate on these appropriation bills did not exercise their right to make that contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was literally last night when we had fevered advice from the government that it was now or never in terms of today for the appropriation bills. I might say that this advice came at a time when there had been many opportunities which the government could have exercised to interrupt the debate on the workplace relations bill at any stage to deal with the appropriation bills. I am sure that most of the senators sitting in the chamber at the moment who made contributions on the family tax issue yesterday would have been willing to make them at a later stage and give more time to dealing with the appropriation bills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do think that the government has had ample opportunity to better order or re&hyphen;order its business in such a way as to allow these particular bills to be passed in good time. I do not believe that any senator in this chamber <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5772"> would have had any difficulty with such a proposal if it had come forward from the government. It did not come forward from the government at any stage. As I indicated, it was only last night that I received a telephonic communication that the bills had to be passed today. I can only come to one of two conclusions as a result of this situation: that is, that we face yet another example of serious mismanagement of the Senate program on the part of the government, or the other conclusion that this is simply some sort of a ruse to force these particular bills through the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me make absolutely clear that from the opposition's perspective, given the changes to the way the committee stages of the appropriation bills will be dealt with, as I have indicated we will honour the letter and the spirit of those changes which were introduced by the previous Labor government. I will quickly move to speak in support of the request that stands in my name before the chamber. I might say that the remarks I make now can also be held to apply to Appropriation Bill (No. 2) when the committee moves to deal with that bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The request for amendments to these two principal appropriation bills before the Senate does provide the Howard government with one last opportunity to reconsider the budgetary folly that it embarked upon. In making this request, the opposition is calling upon the government to right some of the most serious and some of the most grave injustices that are contained in the budget, particularly in relation to cutting funds for labour market programs, for child-care assistance and for nursing homes. Also, there is the termination of the Commonwealth dental health program, which is perhaps the unkindest of all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition considers that the funding increases contained in this request are not economically irresponsible, as was suggested by the minister in his response to the second reading debate. We consider that any attempt by the government to whip up some sort of air of fiscal crisis to justify the budget cuts, which this request seeks to change, really is nothing more than a very transparent, very <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> self-serving ploy on the part of the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth of the matter is that, on all the available international comparisons, the Commonwealth's finances are in sound shape. That is the truth of the matter. Even before this budget, we had the third lowest level of public expenditure in the OECD, the fourth lowest level of public debt and the third lowest deficit. The argument of the opposition is that a more moderate form of fiscal consolidation was required from this budget. What was not required was the hairy chested, ideologically driven rush to fill the phantom black hole&mdash;the black hole that we hear very little about any more from the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On this view, the reinstatement of the funding nominated in this request would be consistent with public finances, and is consistent with sound public finances, and the opposition does commend them to the Senate. This is a way of forcing this government to reconsider some of their most short-sighted and most heartless and most vindictive budget cuts. I commend the request to the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats's requests basically come in four parts for Appropriation Bill (No. 1). The first one is an increase to ABC funding, which would return the so-called efficiency dividend&mdash;really an inefficiency dividend&mdash;for this year. As we know, the most severe cuts start next year. We also know that the ABC is now preparing for those severe cuts. Because they believe that they will happen and that they do have to prepare for them, many programs are being cut and many staff are being made redundant. So we believe that it is essential to move those requests at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second lot relate to the new enterprise incentives scheme. The Leader of the Australian Democrats (Senator Kernot), in her speech <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in the second reading debate, gave reasons for why we are moving those amendments, so I will not be talking to those. The third relate to the ethanol bounty. Senator Woodley will be speaking for a very short while on that. The fourth group of amendments relate to ATSIC funding. That has been covered also by Senator Kernot in her speech. Senator Kernot also mentioned where the money would come from if all of these amendments were passed. It is not impossible to find the money; it is quite possible to find it. We believe that they are essential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will speak for a couple of minutes to the increase in ABC funding. Basically, the reason why we believe that the efficiency dividend should not apply to the ABC is the same reason that it has not applied to the ABC for several years now&mdash;the ABC is a different organisation from most organisations to which the efficiency dividend is applied. That is because most of their money goes on programming, and most of their money goes on money to pay staff to do that programming.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have lost a lot of money in the past that other organisations have not lost. It is ridiculous to say that they are not efficient. They are efficient. It is a very efficient organisation. Very many studies in the past have shown that they are efficient. In fact, in the March 1995 report of the Senate Select Committee on ABC Management and Operations&mdash;chaired by the now Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston); I was the deputy chair&mdash;we found that the ABC should not be subject to the efficiency dividend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I still agree with the recommendations of this report. I believe it is important that we give the ABC the indication that we do believe that their funding should not be slashed&mdash;of course, they are about to be. Even this first $11 million is a very difficult amount of money for them to find. I believe that we should stand by our report and our recommendations in the report of last year. Because the ABC is so important&mdash;we need to send this message to them&mdash;and because they are a different organisation from those to which the efficiency dividend applies, or <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5774"> would apply differently: those are the reasons why we should be passing our requests to the House of Representatives to look at increases in ABC funding for this budget. Senator Woodley is going to speak for a few minutes on why we should be looking at the ethanol bounty.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because of the way this debate came on, there have been discussions between offices about requests and so on. As we speak, requests have been readied relating to the Greens (WA) amendments to Appropriation Bill (No. 1) and Appropriation Bill (No. 2). It is my understanding that they do not intrude on any of the other amendments either by the opposition or by the Australian Democrats. When they arrive, I will be able to speak to those.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will speak to the issue of affordability. I point out the fact that tax bills will be coming up in the next couple of weeks. I flag that we will offer revenue options for the government, like a 20 per cent minimum corporate tax, which should be able to raise the government about $1 billion. We will offer revenue raising measures of 50 per cent dividend imputation, which could raise the government around $700 million. We will offer the elimination over three years of the diesel fuel rebate for mining, which should raise the government about $1 billion. So there is no problem, in my understanding, of funding&mdash;even for the maintenance of the reasonable funding that is here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not as if the departments are overly resourced. A lot of the time it is people who have been cut. If you are providing services and you cut people, it is not efficient at all; it is inefficient. My definition of efficiency is being able to provide a service better. If you have more people waiting, fewer people able to access the services and fewer regional branches and so on, that is not efficiency at all. It is only a limited version of productivity a la the government's industrial relations ideology that if you have more jobs and more throughput, throughput equals productivity. It is not outcomes. It is not real efficiency. In my belief, it actually generally leads to greater inefficiencies because, if services <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which were provided are not able to be provided, it shifts the onus on to other, sometimes emergency, services. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the ability for people to deal with their own problems is reduced, then you end up with greater problems. For instance, if you cut from the environment programs&mdash;very modest environment programs, I must say; I do not think we have ever put enough resources into looking after or repairing the environment and looking to our future environmental expenditure&mdash;you do not save money. All you do is transfer the debt from now to the future. The debt, certainly on such things as environmental programs, means that you pay a lot more in the future rather than a smaller amount now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know some people put no value on future debt, no value on what the generations are going to have to pay in the future&mdash;whether or not it be a poor quality education system, a decreasing level of health equity, a change which limits the ability of people to access quality public education at public primary and secondary schools. That debt goes on to the community. We are not saving money. We are actually creating a debt for the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Greens (WA) support the amendments put by Senator Faulkner from the opposition in relation to Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1996. We certainly will be wishing to add to that discussion once our amendments are circulated. It is very important to remind ourselves that the amounts, such as the $578 million in labour market and training assistance programs, that have been mentioned are essential. We cannot pull out systems that are working and assume that somehow or other those people will just go away. They will not just go away. They are hundreds of thousands of real people. We worked out that something like 120,000 got missed off the list in relation to different categories of people. There will be more added to the list when service providers to the community are cut out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Decreasing wages and conditions in the community leads to more unemployment. It affects our ability to pay for basic goods and services, such as small businesses that operate in an area to provide lawn&hyphen;mowing, hairdressing, window cleaning, carpentry or car repair work. The ability to purchase goods and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5775"> services operated by the community changes. In terms of wages and conditions, the average worker on a federal award has known what the future holds. The ability to purchase goods and services from the local community and small business becomes a great deal weaker once you decrease wages and conditions simply for the ideological purpose of trying to be internationally competitive, even though a great number of people in Australia are producing goods and services to be used in Australia. It is very short-sighted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These cuts in labour market and training assistance will haunt the current government. You cannot pull out assistance like that and not expect that the large group of people who will be currently disenfranchised from the system will not turn up in some other area as a large and growing socially disenfranchised group of people. Be it on the head of the government if they continue to think that is possible and that they can get away with that kind of thoughtless, single-minded and short-sighted approach. I will be supporting the opposition's amendments in relation to maintaining&mdash;I do not think there are any outlandish increases&mdash;decent levels of funding for basic programs and providing basic government services.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> I know, however, that the official view of the government is that they are not in favour of this measure which the Democrats are pushing. They have set their mind against it&mdash;or should I say very directly that the minister has. This is very clearly an action by a minister who has no concern for any alterna tive to the fossil fuel industry because of his own involvement in it. That is all he can see.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister is a great supporter of the coal industry, as we know. I believe that the petroleum industry has also got to him. Because of that, the abolition of the ethanol fuel bounty is really an ideological position that he has adopted. He wants nothing to do with an industry that is on the verge of having a significant future in this country. It is an industry that would contribute significantly to the environmental obligations that we have in this country. It contributes significantly to rural jobs, rural industry and regional development. It contributes significantly to value adding for primary industry. Despite all those advantages, this minister says, `No, thank you. I want to support my friends in the fossil fuel industry, so I am going to get rid of a competitor', which is exactly what ethanol is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is about time that government members opened their minds on this one, even if they have to offend their minister. The rest of the government ought to pull him into line. This country pays something like&mdash;this is a minimum figure&mdash;$5 to $8 billion in direct subsidies to fossil fuel using and producing industries that damage the environment. They also contribute to global warming with their encouragement of fossil fuel use. The fossil fuel industries are very much against the development of the ethanol industry in Australia and have apparently put pressure on the government to drop the scheme. It is a bad decision by the government for many reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am conscious of the pressure of time. I would like to spend a lot of time speaking on this, but I will not. I am prepared to try to fit in with the government's program. Because they have stuffed it up completely, they now have to put this kind of pressure on the Senate. They really do not deserve cooperation. However, let me say again that this bounty will help greenhouse gas emissions significantly. It is promoting regional industry and jobs. It is value adding to primary industry. This government wants to send it down <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5776"> the tube.

What I would like to see this committee do, and the Senate do, is adopt certain requests which we have some confidence that a substantial number of government backbenchers, if not the government, would support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a whole range of requests here that have been provided to us by the opposition and by the Australian Democrats. As I indicated, there has not been a great deal of time to give detailed consideration to all of them. Indeed, I received the draft late last night after knock-off time&mdash;what is knock&hyphen;off time around here anyhow? I noted that the date on which the amendments were circulated was today's date at, I think, 10.03 a.m.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there has not been a great deal of time to give full consideration to them&mdash;on the basis that we need to, apparently, get the appropriations through for them to be sent to the House of Representatives. I understand if we do not do that today then there will be a cost of $300,000 to bring the House of Representatives back for them to do it in time for the fiscal purposes of the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I would like to see happen is the isolation of a couple of requests which do in fact have the support of a number of government members. If we pass this this afternoon with, say, a raft of amendments which go, really, to the heart of the budget, the House of Representatives will be waiting to deal with it. If the House of Representatives is told, `Yes, there are requests that have come from the Senate,' I would suggest that those requests would get short shrift. But if we isolated two areas where we know that there have been substantial concerns by members of the government and those areas are not going to the heart of the government savings program, then that is what I suggest we might do.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Madam Acting Deputy President, I did not get advice last night that this was likely to happen. Today we thought that, amongst all the other work that we do, we would have a chance to circulate our own amendments to this very important appropriation bill. I also did not get the impression this morning that we would not have access to debating time this afternoon. The reason that was given as to why we had to do it today was that the House of Representatives is not sitting next week and, therefore, it would cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to bring members back. We listened to that, and many people are trying to cooperate here in relation to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now we find out that, not only is it too inconvenient and expensive&mdash;which we understand&mdash;to get the House of Representatives back to deal with an issue which should have been managed early this week by rearranging the program, but we are told that the House of Representatives is sitting until only 5.30 p.m., that members want to get <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5778"> away early on their flights and, therefore, we cannot use debating time this afternoon to finish this off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am trying to be as cooperative as I am able in the circumstances but, as I say, I did not hear about this last night. I was not aware of this until just the last couple of minutes. We understood that, no matter what time was available this afternoon, there would still be government documents. I did not have any idea this morning, when this shemozzle was mentioned, that this meant there would be no debating time to finish off the appropriations bills this afternoon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that it is still Thursday, not Friday afternoon and not Christmas Eve, if it is important to save the $300,000&mdash;and I agree that is reasonable&mdash;I suggest it might not be unreasonable for the adjournment of the House of Representatives to be fitted in so that the reasonable effort that is being made by the Senate to properly deal with this bill is taken into consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From the point of view of the staff, and certainly from the point of view of my staff, it is not fair to suggest a sudden change in the program when we are not given the lunchtime to get things in order and deal with this bill properly. I do not think it is reasonable. I can see that if we go to a vote the numbers might well go against me. I do not think this is good practice. If the government in the House of Representatives is asking for it, it should do its part also. If it is an important bill to the government, it should do its part along with the Senate to try to get this bill dealt with properly.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I think some of the points that Senator Margetts has made have some substance in terms of the shemozzle the government is responsible for this morning. However, having been informed that there is a genuine urgency about the appropriation bills, I did indicate in my contribution during the committee stage debate that the opposition would do all that it could to facilitate the passage of the appropriation bills. I am not going to resile from the commitment that I made. </PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems at this stage that the best and most sensible approach for us to take is to delay general business this afternoon after the taking note of questions. I would suggest a period of dedicated government business time for anything up to two hours after the taking note of questions after question time this afternoon. So that would commence at approximately 3.30 p.m. That would give ample opportunity for the Senate to finalise its approach. Obviously, any requests that are passed have to go to the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate sits next week, and it is the timetable of the House of Representatives that is of concern to the government. I think we need to acknowledge that. The House of Representatives is not sitting next week, otherwise we would not be having this debate at all. I suggest that, if we have that two-hour period, all amendments can be dealt with in a reasonable time frame. It will certainly give the House of Representatives an opportunity to consider the requests of the Senate if any are carried to appropriation bills Nos 1 and 2.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask whether, in the same spirit of cooperation that has been clearly evidenced by the approach of the opposition, the government would consider that a sensible way of dealing with the impasse that we now find ourselves in, given that as it is almost 1 o'clock we normally deal with non-controversial business. If other business were not to be conducted, it would have been possible to have series of one-minute divisions perhaps going through to 1.45.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the points that Senator Margetts makes about the circulation of her amendments and the like are not without some substance. So, in the spirit of genuinely trying to address this matter, I ask the Leader of the Government whether the approach I have indicated would be acceptable to the government. That would mean that we would move to non-controversial business. I believe there is one bill listed for debate at lunchtime today. So I ask the government for a response.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make it clear that the arrangements for dealing with the wool stockpile were introduced by the former government in 1994. We acknowledge that the then opposition, now the government, basically supported those arrangements. The issue that we are dealing with now with the wool stockpile and its hopeful disappearance by the year 2000 is that, since 1994, the program has worked very well to reduce the stockpile and its influence on market prices. I think that the real issue for the wool industry is how we got into that situation in the first place with the wool stockpile.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad you interjected, Senator McGauran. I remember John Kerin, as primary industries minister, coming to the Labor Party caucus to seek approval for the guaranteed floor price scheme. The wool industry, dominated by wool growers, was recommending that the floor price, the average price, the guaranteed price, consistently go up and up. When the market started to get a bit shaky, his recommendation, on behalf of the wool industry itself, to the federal parliamentary Labor Party and to the government was that we should guarantee the price. This is what the wool growers wanted.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what happened? Over a period of a year or so, when prices were collapsing in the marketplace, the Australian government picked up the guarantee, which, I think, within 18 months, reached nearly $4 billion. What had happened? In the late 1980s and early 1990s, but particularly in the late 1980s, the industry, in my view, got greedy and tried to use the price mechanism to overcharge the world market for wool.</PARA>

In the end, it was left with the unreality that people in the world market were being asked to pay 800c or 900c per kilogram for wool when the marketplace was not willing to bid. So, when the wool was on the market floor, the government had to pick up the guarantee and purchase it because it was not reaching the reserve price.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, you have got your history wrong, Senator McGauran. The first reserve price scheme for wool was introduced by the Whitlam government in 1974. It was a floor price scheme. It was floor priced so that there was a bottom through which it should not fall. What happened in the late 1980s was that the wool industry, to be blunt about it, got a bit greedy. It tried to shift the floor price up to become a ceiling price which, in the attic, we could not fall through. So instead of being a floor price to guarantee minimum income for wool growers, we tried to fix the market level at a price for wool which, in the end, the world market was not willing to pay. Then we said to the Australian taxpayers, `We want you to guarantee this price so that we can try to beat the world wool market in forcing them to pay this higher price.' In the end it all came tumbling down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember at the time someone pointing out that New Zealanders and Argentineans were getting a real benefit from our reserve price for wool. Why? Because when we were setting it at 800c a kilogram, they were selling just underneath, at 750c, disposing of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> their wool because their price was a bit cheaper than our reserve price. Our reserve price scheme was the best thing New Zealanders and Argentineans&mdash;two of the world's major producers of wool on the export market&mdash;ever had working for them. Our taxpayers made the Argentinean and New Zealand wool industries very profitable. What a mug bunch we were!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say I cannot prove this outside of the caucus room but, Senator McGauran, through you, Madam Acting Deputy President, I was one of the first members of the federal parliamentary Labor Party to question John Kerin. I asked: how long are we going to go on providing a reserve price, a guarantee, for the stockpile, because in the end the country cannot afford a $3&half; or $4 billion guarantee?</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These are simple economics, Senator Panizza. You have had some experience in the wool industry. The real issue with the reserve price scheme when it became a floor price rather than what we tried to turn it into&mdash;a ceiling price through which we could not fall&mdash;was that we tried to play around with the international market because we were the major growers in the world, the major producers. We all but destroyed the wool industry as a result.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that, back in 1974 when the Whitlam government introduced the first scheme, I was an enthusiastic Labor Party supporter of it&mdash;with some rural background&mdash;as everybody was. But what we actually did to the wool industry was to say to the wool producers, `Produce whatever wool you like, whatever amount you like, in whatever quality you like, and someone else will have the responsibility of marketing it.' We removed from the wool growers any incentive for them to think about the quality of their wool and about the marketing of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The comparison we could make is with the cotton industry, where there was never a reserve price scheme operating in Australia. It was a totally free market where the cotton producers looked at selling on the futures market, getting forward contracts and so on. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5781"> This was all, of course, strongly opposed by a lot in the wool industry who wanted a guaranteed price. The cotton industry very rapidly grew in this country to become one of our major export earners, with no reserve price scheme operating, no guarantee operating, with the cotton producers themselves taking the responsibility of working out what was the best price. That is an example. Unfortunately, the wool industry has had to learn the hard way and, I have to say, the Australian taxpayer has had to learn the hard way, over the last half decade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that the bill before us today gives greater flexibility in the way in which the remaining part of the stockpile will be disposed of by the year 2000. I am told in the bill, which we support, that 31 December 1998 has been set for the final repayment of the debt and that the last bale of wool goes out of the stockpile no later than 31 December 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The history of Australian agriculture, with the events relating to the stockpile, and the collapse of the wool market and the wool industry in the late 1980s to early 1990s, is one that this parliament should never forget. It should never be removed from our institutional memory that trying to play around and rig a market, because we are the major producers, and to do it at the taxpayer's expense and as a taxpayer guarantee, is not a responsible way to go. It has done the wool industry enormous damage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should obviously dominate the wool industry, not only in production but also in processing. If we had spent a small proportion of the money that we had guaranteed to wool production on marketing and processing in Australia, instead of exporting hundreds of thousands of bales of wool full of dirt and grease and so on every year, we would be exporting finished cloth. There would have been value added to the process, creating a lot more jobs. It is very good to see, in so many cases now around Australia, individual wool growers taking the responsibility of producing wool for a particular part of the market, following it through with their own processing, with direct contracts, and producing <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> finished, high quality woollen garments and exporting them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Ballarat 18 months ago a wool producer bought his own equipment and was scouring, spinning and weaving the wool and producing high quality, individually designed patterns. He employed several scores of hand&hyphen;knitters around Australia who took his high quality yarn and knitted it into individually designed jumpers. Those jumpers were put into special packs and exported to the American market and were selling for $200 or $300 each. That is an example to us all of classic, perfect value adding. That was a wool producer taking&mdash;from one end to the other&mdash;total control of his own economic destiny. We should encourage many more of our wool producers to do the same, either individually or collectively, through cooperative arrangements with each other. They are then taking control of their own future by being involved in working out contract arrangements to sell their wool, and working out what is the best quality of wool that the market wants at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No longer can any agricultural industry, let alone the wool industry, argue that to produce it is the only issue. That is the easy thing for Australian agriculture. You have got to get the production, the marketing and the value added processing right. The whole debacle&mdash;that is the only thing it can be called&mdash;related to an industry trying to fix the market, not at its own expense but at the expense of the Australian taxpayers. Ultimately, many farmers did suffer horrendous losses, because not even the taxpayers of Australia could sustain a guaranteed price of 800c to 1,000c per kilogram&mdash;the level at which it was set in 1990. The opposition supports this legislation and looks forward to seeing a more prosperous wool industry as a result.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HX5">Senator WOODLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, and I even agree with some of the history; but there are other perspectives on history, as you know. History is always written by the winners. The Democrats, having had the agony of debates that had gone on at least since 1990, were trying to represent some of the wool growers who had a contrary opinion to that of both the government and the coalition, even in 1993.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was going to spend a lot of time reading what was said at the hearings in 1993. Some of the things those wool growers said were quite prophetic. They warned that the very rigid fixed release schedule, which was put in place, would operate as a factor in forcing the price of wool down while the stockpile remained high and while the 187,000 bales on average per quarter were being pushed onto the market. They warned the  auction system for new wool could not withstand competition of large amounts of wool from the stockpile being pushed onto the market. They were right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Except for a couple of peaks, we have had no improvement in the price of wool during the last three years. While people will argue with me and say, `There are a lot of reasons for that,' very few in the government or the opposition are prepared to admit that one of the contributing factors was the rigid fixed release schedule. No&hyphen;one can convince me that it was not a contributing factor. I was going to read a lot of what was said in 1993, but I am not going to do that because&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, because I would have had to pick pieces out. But it is worth repeating that the words of the wool growers at the hearing on 22 October 1993 who warned us about what would happen were prophetic. They warned us that the fixed release schedule would have the effect that it has had. There are always, in this kind of debate, a number of truths. The other truth that has to be put alongside this one is that there is a very real argument which says that the stockpile had to be reduced as quickly and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> significantly as possible. The fixed release selling schedule has had that effect. The stockpile is now at a much more manageable level.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government had to be dragged screaming to make this minor amendment to the fixed release schedule. In 1993, the then shadow minister, and now minister Anderson, did not want to hear any of the arguments which were put to him. It has to be said that even this year the minister was reluctant to make any alteration to the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It may be that we have reached a stage where this amendment is almost irrelevant because of the reduction in the size of the stockpile. I think we should have given Wool International the flexibility in marketing that it needed a lot earlier than this. We put up the idea of a trigger price. If it had been put in place in 1993 it would have given Wool International flexibility. People will argue about that with me till the cows come home, but I will keep saying it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now, towards the end of the whole process, we are at last giving Wool International a bit more flexibility through reducing the amount from the stockpile which has to be sold and also giving them a little bit of flexibility at the upper end so that they can sell from the stockpile if the market improves. That is important. The Democrats will support the legislation. I commend the legislation to the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Wool International Amendment Bill does two things. Firstly, it replaces the current terms of the fixed disposal schedule of the wool stockpile with more flexible provisions and reduces the 185,000 bales a quarter to be sold initially to 135,000 bales a quarter. Secondly, it provides for a change in emphasis of the role of Wool International, requiring it to have regard to the effect of its disposal on the market. In effect, it therefore requires Wool International to maximise the profitability of wool growers both in terms of the value of their fresh wool and their equity in the stockpile.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5783"> This legislation comes substantially out of the second wool round table conference in August. Minister Anderson is to be congratu lated in bringing all the disparate wool groups together twice this year&mdash;in May and August&mdash;to get some agreement. As Senator Woodley said, there had been enormous pressure from the Wool Council, the stud merino breeders and many others for a change of the stockpile disposal. I suppose the story of the wool industry is a bit like that of Greek political parties: if you have five Greeks, you generally have at least six political parties. If you have five wool growers, you have six solutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are no easy solutions with wool&mdash;and it has been a very long and painful seven years. I guess this legislative change today will go some way to finding some solutions; hopefully, it does. Out of the second wool round table, commonsense and compromise prevailed and all the participants came to a position which they could all reasonably accept. The participants included interests, both overseas and Australian, from all sectors&mdash;manufacturers, processors, brokers and growers. The position on future stockpile management is well known and I will not go through that because of the shortness of time allowed for this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is the beginning of the final chapter of what has been a disastrous seven years for the wool industry. The first attempt to handle the 4.7 million bale stockpile and the $2.8 billion debt was an attempt to sell enough wool to meet debt repayments. That had a disastrous effect because, when we got to the end of a period where a certain amount of money needed to be repaid, the market came under enormous pressure. It was speculation in reverse. That was just not a way to sell anything.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second attempt was the setting up of Wool International by the previous government, which we supported. Again, there were no easy answers and the set stockpile reduction of 185,000 bales per quarter came into operation. This worked adequately for the reduction of the stockpile and the debt. But pain to wool growers continued for the whole of the period, and it continues and can never be underestimated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These new changes are all about increasing the value of the stockpile and also of fresh <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> wool sales as soon as possible post 1 January next year. This is an attempt to provide the market signals that will give wool growers hope and profitability, and also encourage them to continue growing wool. That is something that also cannot be underestimated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to make a couple of brief final points. The first is to wish our colleague Senator Winston Crane a speedy recovery. I mention him in this context because Senator Crane is one of the staunchest supporters in this place of the wool industry. I do not think it has a greater friend than Senator Crane. As chairman of the rural and regional affairs committee he has been vitally involved in the evidence that was provided to the Senate on the options that might have been available in changing the actual stockpile sales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point is to note that the wool industry reached another milestone this week in stockpile sales, with the stockpile falling to below two million bales. So it has more than halved in the last three years from its high of 4.7 million bales. By June next year, the stockpile will be 1.7 million bales&mdash;that is, a massive three million bales will have been sold down over six years. The debt, which peaked at $2.8 billion in 1991, will be $900 million by the end of this month. By June 1997, this debt should be reduced substantially, to around $600 million, and the equity remaining will be of great assistance to wool growers. Hopefully, it will be in excess of $500 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5784"> Access to that equity is for debate at another time, as is the role of Wool International in forward marketing proposals and the proposed wool joint venture. Of course, the future funding and role of promotion is another big issue for debate at another time. With those few words, I applaud the minister for the work he has done in the wool industry. He has had an enormous requirement to come to grips with a very difficult historical record of problems and the enormous number of different solutions that have been put forward. With great tenacity and a capacity to master the facts, I think he has been able to provide a framework so that we can go on, hopefully, to a time of much greater prosperi ty and development in a very great Australian industry.</PARA></SPEECH>

The problems came about not necessarily because of the greed of the growers, but because of the growers' peak body. I agree with that. The change away from 187,000 bales per quarter was not necessarily brought about totally by the industry.

The measure of the importance that the Senate, if not the parliament, has given the Wool International Amendment Bill 1996 is that it was given priority as a matter of urgency. It jumped over many other seemingly equally important bills to be voted on at this very moment so that it can be enacted on 1 January 1997. That is the importance the Senate has given it.

I thought he was a little too kind to Senator Schacht, quite frankly. Senator Schacht is not a bad senator, and he was a very good dairy farmer in his day, but I think he had a bit of difficulty grappling with the wool industry's history. There was a touch of rewriting there.

You should not take advantage of Senator Panizza, because he can bite back just as hard on people like you. He is in a good mood today, but I cannot allow your trying to rewrite history to that extent to go by. Of course, elements of what you said were true: there is no doubt about that.

We all have our version of history&mdash;some versions more truthful than others&mdash;but I cannot come to grips with trying to understand what happened inside your caucus meeting. Do you want us to take it on faith that in fact the caucus actually discussed the wool industry, do you? Even that idea surprises me, let alone that you stuck up for it. I am surprised that the caucus ever got around to discussing the wool industry, when it had so many other things to discuss, such as how much you were going to flog off to the union that week, or what special grants you were going to give that week, and what person was taking an ambassadorial position, ready to go. Anyway, I am quite happy to think that at one stage during your 13 years of government you bothered to discuss the wool industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Getting down to the legislation in the very short time that we have all been given for the debate, because we want the bill to go through, I will say that, a bit like my Democrat colleague, we are all aware of the history of the Garnaut report and its recommendation, which was taken up by the coalition and the then government for a fixed schedule. But <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that time has run its course for whatever benefit it did have.

The wool growers have sent that message loud and clear through the ranks of the industry. I am glad to say that that message got to the round table, but not without a bit of effort by the wool growers to shake up all industry bodies to get that message through. And now we have an acceptable piece of legislation rushed through the parliament. The fact that matters of urgency can be taken through the parliament in a short space of time shows that the parliament can and does work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was only one party that disagreed with this legislation and did not even want to debate it: the Green movement. They had their own particular agenda.

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The good news, Senator Ray, is that, for around two million eligible Australian families with children, the initiative will commence on 1 January 1997, just six weeks away. Australian families will be delighted with the present that will be coming from the coalition government just after Christmas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is another election promise delivered, as the Treasurer says and reminds us frequently, in full and on time. It is an election commitment that will put $1 billion a year into the pockets of Australian families. The coalition framed the policy to give families <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> hope for the future after 13 years of neglect by the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The policy recognises the central importance of the family and the costs of raising families. It offers families choice in whether one parent wants to stay at home to care for children. The family tax initiative recognises that not all Australian families are identical. It recognises a wide range of family structures in Australia. As well as nuclear families, it covers sole parents, grandparents caring for grandchildren and foster families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consistent with our election policy, the initiative is being delivered in two parts. The first part is to increase the tax free threshold of $1,000 per child for families that meet the family income test. This translates to a $200 tax cut per year per eligible child. This part is available to all types of families, including single income families, provided the income tests are met. An eligible family with three dependent children will receive a tax cut of $600 per year, or some $23.10 per fortnight, under this part of the initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the second part of the initiative, single families, including sole parents, with at least one child under the age of five, may be eligible for an additional increased tax free threshold of $2,500. This is an additional tax cut of some $500 per year. This part recognises the additional costs of raising a young family&mdash;and we make no apology for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A family which meets the criteria for both parts with two children under five will receive a total tax cut of some $900 per year or in the order of $34.60 per fortnight. Families do not have to wait until the end of the financial year to access the tax cut. It can be accessed through the PAYE system or on assessment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Low income families which do not have a high enough tax liability to benefit fully from the benefit of the tax cut will have the alternative of receiving the family tax initiative as an equivalent fortnightly cash payment from the Department of Social Security called family tax payments. Some 900,000 families will receive an immediate boost to their disposable income through this payment option from 1 January.</PARA>

The circumstances were as a result of the previous government's policies in relation to these matters. In fact, I am told that a lot of it is purely and simply because of the concerted drive by the previous government to remove support from the private sector. First, the contribution to the reinsurance pool was gradually phased out between 1983 and 1989. That loaded some $100 million onto the funds. Then the bed day subsidy was done away with in September of 1986 at a cost of $135 million. Then the Medicare rebates for in&hyphen;hospital services were reduced to 75 per cent with the funds being required to cover over 25 per cent. Also the Medicare agreements of 1993 gave the states every incentive to increase public patient throughput at the expense of private patients, thus pushing private patients into private hospitals with increased costs to the insurance funds.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Boswell for that question. You do not know how pleased it makes me to answer it. As Senator Faulkner rightly identified, 10 September was not a good day for Labor members and for the Democrats. In a rush to make a very cheap political point, they disallowed a number of regulations and of course realised later what they had done. What they had done was cause enormous heartbreak and concern in rural communities, communities which Senator West pretends to look after. She accuses the National Party of walking both sides of the street when in fact she does the same herself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The regulations that were disallowed were in fact the previous government's own regulations. They disallowed their own regulations; their own budget decisions from the 1995&hyphen;96 families package. They came in here and disallowed their own minister's regulations. They were decisions that were taken by the previous cabinet and endorsed by the previous cabinet including some members opposite here. Then they came and voted against them to make a cheap political point. The disallowed regulations actually came from the then minister, Minister Free.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition's decision to support the disallowance was done in haste and they wiped out Austudy assistance to rural families in exceptional circumstances in drought affected areas. This would have taken assistance through to the end of the year in which the drought recovery period ends. The action of the Labor opposition was completely irresponsible and could have dealt a very savage blow to rural Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As usual, the people opposite created the mess and we have been left to fix it up. This government was very concerned about the mess that was created by Labor members opposite. Drought exceptional circumstances were revoked from parts of South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland on 11 June and students from those areas would not have got Austudy until <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5790"> the end of the calendar year if we had not acted. That gap might not mean a very large amount to some, but it is a lot to the people who were expecting it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Boswell, together with Senator Woodley&mdash;who graciously and rapidly recognised the error of his ways&mdash;moved to rescind the disallowance on 9 October 1996. This week we have reintroduced these Austudy regulations to ensure the assistance to rural Australia. We have re&hyphen;established student assistance measures to ease the plight of families and students in drought affected areas who otherwise would have been so harshly affected by this opposition move.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we had not moved to reintroduce this Austudy drought relief measure, many students from needy rural families would have had their student allowance reduced or stopped altogether before the end of the year in which they were studying. Students would have been left only getting Austudy for a six&hyphen;month period following the revocation of drought status. In addition, struggling rural families will receive a significant boost from the $81.5 million package of drought recovery assistance recently announced by Minister John Anderson.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The drought recovery period has now been extended from six to 12 months and that extension will assist in securing the future of students from farming families. Together with the government's reintroduction of previously disallowed Austudy regulations, this means additional assistance for rural families. Families in areas whose recovery period would have ended on 11 December will now be able to access student assistance under special concessions until the end of next year. These measures demonstrate the strength of the commitment of the government to assist rural families and our willingness to clean up the mess that Labor creates.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp. With regard to the advice that Minister Fahey's accountant has provided&mdash;that there are no tax implications regarding the directors' loan from Lochreagh Investments Pty Ltd to Mr Fahey&mdash;will you confirm that the advice categorically states that no liability for taxation arises under section 108 of the tax act? The tax act says, in part, `If a private company pays an amount to an associated person by way of an advance or loan so much, if any, of the amount paid or credited as, in the opinion of the commissioner, represents a distribution of profits shall be deemed to be a dividend paid by the company.' Given this, will you refer this issue to the tax commissioner in order to seek his opinion whether section 108 of the tax act does, indeed, apply to the directors' loan to Mr Fahey and, if you will not refer it, why not?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

If it is part of the CSO, then it is enshrined in legislation. If it is not, then it is difficult to see why a company should voluntarily accept a social obligation, particularly when it is facing much greater competition, when even now it is under competitive pressure and when it does want to ensure that its products are delivered at the lowest cost.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5797"></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="5797" SPEAKER="Alston, Sen Richard" NAMEID="LD4" ELECTORATE="VIC" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Communications and the Arts" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The decision to phase out the analog service over the period up to the year 2000 was one taken back in late 1992 by the then Minister for Communications, Senator Bob Collins. You will recall by that time he had been pretty much pilloried by every editorialist and cartoonist in the country about the satellite licence fiasco. I think that one can also say that this was another example of a decision that was technology specific and a very dangerous thing to do in a deregulated environment, one in which new technologies are constantly appearing out of left field.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nonetheless, the decision was taken. A lot of water has gone under the bridge since that time. The licence conditions attached for both Optus and Vodafone provided them with very clear entitlements, particularly insofar as any change might be applied by the government. It was not one that would be able to unduly erode the value of the carriers' rights. As far as Vodafone is concerned, their agreement specifically made clear that the government would proceed with the phase&hyphen;out. On that basis, they chose to roll out a dedicated digital service. Vodaphone's rights could only be taken away or affected by the minister with their approval.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is against that background that, when we came into office, we carefully reviewed the implications of that decision and decided not only that might we expose the Commonwealth to claims for potentially hundreds of millions of dollars but also that it had gone too far down the track to reverse it. On that basis, we were particularly concerned to ensure that the interests of rural users were preserved. We were particularly conscious of the fact that Labor had shown no concern for the implications in rural areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our policy approach will not abandon rural Australians. Instead, by the time we get to 1999, there will be a review of the phase-out and the progress that has been made according to the timetable we announced several months back. That review will determine what planned service areas should continue to receive a mobile telephone coverage either from GSM or any other technologies which might then be commercially available. On that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> basis, we will have an infinitely superior policy approach to that of the previous administration, which was simply concerned with blindly implementing technology specific decisions without regard for the interests of rural consumers. On the approach we have adopted, we will be ensuring that those who might otherwise find themselves at the mercy of a decision that might leave them altogether without coverage will not go uncared for. Our policy will ensure that rural communities will get a much better deal as a result.</PARA></ANSWER>

From 1 July next year, when we have full and open competition, there will be the opportunity for many new services as well as competition to existing services to be available. We certainly expect that, as the profit margins reduce as a result of increased competition in urban areas, a number of the players will start to focus on meeting what I think is a significant level of unmet demand in rural areas. Certainly already we are seeing the building of cable TV networks or MDS systems in some regional or rural areas. That will certainly accelerate come 1 July next year.</PARA></TALK.START>

These changes were undertaken to an office which, since its construction in 1978, has had very little by way of upgrading or refurbishment. In the past 18 years the carpet was replaced only once, and that was in 1988. I am told that the total cost of the work undertaken in the office was just under $8,400 and that no work has been undertaken on the Sydney office used by Mr Max Moore-Wilton since his appointment.</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION></QUESTION.BLOCK></QWN>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill), to a question without notice asked by Senator Neal today, relating to private health insurance premiums.</PARA>
<PARA>I have to say that the entire response provided and the actions of this government to date on this whole issue are a ringing example of the deceit of this budget. This certainly is a lie that has come home to roost. The fact is that your lies, like vultures, will continue to gather and eventually those lies will tear apart this government because fundamentally the basis of this government is that it has entirely a lack of integrity in relation to this budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On budget day and since the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has affirmed that the private health insurance rebate will have some worth when it is introduced on 1 July next year. This is obviously not the case. At a total cost to this community of $600 million, the rebates for health insurance were brought in and they were meant to provide some benefit to the battlers of Australia. But obviously this is not the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Originally they were meant to give some relief to the huge premiums payable&mdash;$125 for single people, $250 for couples without children and $450 for families with children. But obviously this is not going to be the case because already this is the second round of increases not only since this budget measure was introduced but also since the Prime Minister referred the matter off to an inquiry <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5802"> and assured us that he would look with some askance at any applications by insurers to increase their premiums. But obviously the health insurance industry, like much of Australia, does not give much regard to what the views of the Prime Minister are, because despite his views as expressed the industry has applied for increases&mdash;and not just minor increases, but increases of between $190 and $240 for families with top cover insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does that mean? It means that, for couples without children, already some six months before these rebates come into effect the rebates are worth nothing. For those people who have children, substantially the rebates are of no value. So, if you look at it as a matter of logic, do you think the large proportion of Australians are going to believe that the expenditure of $600 million over four years will be money well spent when the vast majority of Australians are going to be worse off by 1 July with regards to the amount of money that they are paying for their private health insurance? I really do not think so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you look at the fact that they spend that amount of money in that area but they are cutting back in other areas of health, you really have to question the government's priorities and whether this government really understands what the priorities of the Australian people are. While the government is spending $600 million on a rebate that does not put money in the pockets of battlers but puts money into the pockets of those private health insurance firms, what is the government doing to the battlers? It is closing down 86 Medicare offices. That is what it is doing. What else is the government doing? It is taking approximately 400 doctors out of circulation, stopping them from getting provider numbers every year. It is cutting $3.12 million out of public hospital funding as a result of only this budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The fact is that this government's priorities are wrong, and they are particularly wrong in terms of health. This government took money out of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. It introduced an additional charge of 50c for pensioners and an additional charge of $2.70 for non&hyphen;concessional cardholders for every script. It has cut funds to the Medicare sched ule. It has taken out $400 million over four years. They are not the right priorities; this is deceit.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1X4">Senator WEST</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, certainly fish&hyphen;net stockings seem to get into it as well. What we have seen is a paltry amount being offered to people to take out private health insurance. Before that comes into operation, we have seen increases in private health premiums that will erode just about the whole amount that is to be returned to people in the form of assistance. What would $125 assistance for single people buy in terms of private health insurance, private health insurance which would exempt people on higher incomes from having to pay an increased Medicare levy? One hundred and twenty five dollars does not buy very much. It might buy one or two months of basic cover for a single person. For a couple, it is $250. What does that buy? About the same. And $450 for a family! That would not even cover the basic premium for a single person.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government obviously do not care. They say they believe in families and they talk about families being important, but when it actually comes down to it they do nothing. What does buying private health insurance mean for low income people? It buys them debt, because when you have private health insurance the doctors can charge you what they want&mdash;and they will charge way over and above the schedule fee and people will be paying the difference out of their pockets. That is what buying private health insurance means for people. It buys them bills; nothing more, nothing less.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People are going to have to find the money, first of all, to pay for the private health insurance, even with the rebate, because it will not cover anywhere near half of the amount they are going to be required to pay. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5803"> Then every time they have to use it, they are going to be charged more money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot of people say that this will encourage people into private hospitals. The occupancy rate of private hospitals has not declined; in fact, it has increased in recent years. Some people are choosing to go to private hospitals and they are choosing their method of payment. It might be a variation of self&hyphen;insurance, but they feel happier putting the $1,000, $2,000 or $3,000 a year that they would otherwise spend on private health insurance into a bank account and collecting the interest which they can then utilise themselves. They are making those choices and we have to be very aware of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To paint this as a method of caring for people is a very cruel and false thing to be doing. It is not really caring for people; it is just transferring. We hear a lot from this government these days about cost shifting. This is another example of cost shifting. This is shifting the obligation of the government to provide health care for all Australians onto the individual. It almost reeks of an implication that when people get sick it is their own fault. This is the whole tenor of the response and the program that the government is promoting. It is a really false and cruel thing to be doing to people, particularly when you see that it is making huge cuts to programs such as the Commonwealth dental health plan that are of great benefit to people on low incomes. If people have good dental health they also have good nutrition, they have an improved health status and they visit the doctor less. But that is not the way with this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also see the government attacking pensioners by increasing their contribution under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, by 50c per prescription, with no commensurate increase in their pension rate, unlike what we always did. If there was an increase in such charges, we increased the pension to cover it. All these sorts of things that this government is undertaking show a government that does not care about average people and that is totally out of touch with the budgets and needs of the average person.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With a contribution like that to add to our intelligence and insight, how could we go wrong? Heavy irony, Senator! What you do not know about health would fill volumes. What we know is that some interesting points have been made today. The premiums of private health funds have just rocketed again, making absolutely valueless, useless, your great promise of tax rebates to help people with the cost of private health insurance. </PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5804">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason people used to take out private health insurance and why it was introduced was to protect people from big bills. The only way you get a medical bill now is if you have private health insurance. It is completely useless. Let me say it once again&mdash;you will not hear it, but I do not mind saying it once, twice or three times: the only way you get a bill in health these days is if you have private health insurance. It has been completely defeated in terms of what it was established for&mdash;to protect people from very large health costs that could cripple them or their families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now have a system that protects people completely from the costs of big bills. It is called Medicare. The only way you get a bill in the health area is if you have private health insurance. That is the principal reason. There are three reasons people have been leaving private health insurance. The first reason is the simplicity, equity, fairness and availability of Medicare. The second reason is that the only way you get a bill is if you have private health insurance. A lot of people have sat down and thought, `I can have this operation for no further outlay under the public system, or I can go into the private system and get a very big bill.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you have not seen the letters, I will tell you about the ones that I have received. `Dear Senator, for 30 years I have had private health insurance and have never really claimed against it. The other day I had to use it and now I have a bill of $3,000. How can I pay that back on my pension?' The answer is that they can not. That is exactly what they are saying to us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third reason people are dropping out of private health insurance is that the premiums continue to rise, and rise and rise. Mr Howard, not knowing the process, rushed to interfere. `Don't worry,' he said to the people of Australia. `I'll stop the tide of rising health premiums. I'll fix it. We'll have a little committee to inquire.' That was very foolish of Mr Howard, because what he discovered is that that is not how the process works at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The process is an estimate of costs and outlays and reasonable financial statements according to certain rules through the department, and it is no more than a rubber stamp <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> by the minister for health. The Prime Minister has no capacity, short of changing legislation, to intrude in that at all. So big&hyphen;noting himself on the floor of the House of Representatives has meant that he has finished up with mud on his face, if not egg, because he got it wrong. He can do nothing to stop these latest increases. What they will do will contribute to more people leaving health insurance and therefore premiums having to rise even further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator West has said very properly and very exactly that private hospitals have had increasing use, despite the introduction of Medicare. They said Medicare would be the ruination of them. Indeed, it is exactly the opposite. They still have spare capacity and are desperately looking for custom, and they have had increased use through the private hospital system. So you cannot say that the private hospital system is suffering, but you can say that the cost of private health insurance is now outside the reach of most people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If people are sensible about private health insurance, they will make a choice not to buy it because it is so expensive and the one thing it guarantees them is a big bill. It is associated with doctor of choice and it is associated with more rapid access to a hospital bed. Under Medicare anybody in this country, privately insured or not, can get into a public hospital according to need and no other criteria. I find it very offensive that that is not the case in private hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why should people have to wait a longer time when there is a bed available in a private hospital but no doctor prepared to operate on them for Medicare benefits only? That is the big scandal in this area. That is the scandal that should be addressed, not a cheap handout of $600 million as a straight tax give&hyphen;away for people to induce them to keep private health insurance. It is a very bad piece of government economy, and it is not working.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the further answer given by the Minister for Communications and the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5805"> Arts (Senator Alston) today, to a question without notice asked by Senator Calvert on 10 October 1996, relating to the proposed partial privatisation of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA>Today Senator Alston, 42 days after a dorothy dixer asked by Senator Calvert, explained that his information was wrong. What I find astonishing is that he asked Senator Calvert, clearly by prior arrangement, to ask a question saying that Senator O`Brien in his maiden speech was wrong about the employment numbers that would be affected by the privatisation of Telstra in Tasmania. We now have an explanation from Senator Alston saying that he was wrong and that, instead of it being two per cent loss of jobs in Tasmania as a result of privatisation, it is eight per cent&mdash;116 jobs would go in Tasmania rather than about 20 or 30.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that answer he gave on 10 October, we had a minister arrogantly rolling around with the figures saying that the opposition was wrong. This was a question he set up for himself to have a go at Senator O`Brien's maiden speech. In three or four days he could have got the information from Telstra, yet it took 42 days to apologise to the Senate that he had it wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not the first time the minister for communications has got employment figures wrong. In the estimates hearing, he claimed that since 1991 there had only been a few thousand job losses. Senator Carr demolished that. In the end, he had to disown even what his own office had put before the Senate in the estimates committee, saying, `That clarifying answer was not approved by me.' So he bagged one of his staff members. The next thing he will do is probably blame Telstra, as the letter was sent to him on 21 November, 42 days later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is astonishing that Senator Alston could get up in three days to bag Senator O'Brien and his maiden speech, but 42 days later Telstra sends him a note to clarify it. As I say, this is not the first time the minister has got his employment figures wrong in Telstra.

The loss of 116 jobs in Tasmania will have a bigger impact than it would on a bigger city on the mainland of Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not, as I say, the first time this minister has misled the Senate on job losses in Telstra.

Today in the Senate he has said, `I am sorry, 42 days ago I got it wrong.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is astonishing that he got it wrong in answer to his own dorothy dixer. He did not get it wrong in answer to a question without notice from the opposition that he got without warning. He gave the question to Senator Calvert to ask. He could not even get the information right from Telstra to give the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, this bill will give legislative effect to an agreement entered into by the Commonwealth Government with the State of Victoria to return windfall tax associated with the announced settlement of a long running dispute between the Victorian gas utilities (GASCOR and GENVIC) and their gas suppliers (ESSO and BHP). The dispute concerned the ability of the producers to pass on to the Victorian utilities the impact of the Commonwealth's Petroleum Resource Rent Tax (PRRT). <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5808"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth has long supported a negotiated settlement to the dispute as being in the best interest of both parties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The agreement reached between the parties involves, among other issues, the Victorian Government making a payment to the producers of just over $1 billion to resolve the dispute.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A key element underpinning the agreement between the producers and the Victorian Government was the understanding that windfall tax arising from the $1 billion would be paid to Victoria through a payment to GASCOR. The settlement would not go ahead without this arrangement being put in place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Taxation Office has determined that the settlement payment made to the producers is subject to both Company Tax and PRRT. This will involve a payment to the Commonwealth of an amount of tax of around $625 million. The Commonwealth has determined that approximately $555 million of that amount reflects windfall tax, that is, Approximately $70 million, representing tax payable on amounts previously unpaid by the gas utilities, but not relating to PRRT, will be retained by the Commonwealth and applied to the Budget deficit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The genesis of this dispute dates back to the extension of the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax regime to the Bass Strait, through the enactment of the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax Legislation Amendment Bill 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The act provided that PRRT was to apply on profits recovered from the Bass Strait permit area on or after 1 July 1990, replacing the existing excise and royalty regime. It was expected that the change in taxation arrangements to one based on taxable profits from a petroleum project rather than on production levels would encourage increased activity in the area. This in fact proved to be the case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was recognised at the time that the transition to a new taxation regime could cause changes to Victorian gas prices, with possible disruptive consequences for industry and domestic consumers. The then Government provided the Victorian Government with a special grant of $30 million for each of the first two years of application of the PRRT to minimise these transitional pressures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, what was not known by the Commonwealth at the time was that clauses in long-term gas supply agreements between the Victorian gas utilities and ESSO/BHP would give rise to a dispute about the ability of the producers to pass on the impact of the PRRT to the utilities. This dispute has been the subject of arbitration over a number of years. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be recognised that it has always been the intention that the PRRT should be a tax on above-normal profits (that is, profits over and above project expenditure and a threshold rate of return) associated with offshore projects and should not necessarily flow through to gas prices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the unintended nature of the pass-on dispute, and in order to facilitate its settlement, the Commonwealth has indicated that it should not seek to benefit financially from this settlement. Hence this bill is intended to provide a mechanism to return the windfall tax flowing from the settlement. This should be seen as a fair and reasonable outcome for all parties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The short time frame for consideration of this issue by the Parliament is unavoidable, given the sensitive nature of the complex negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The settlement has been structured so that a simultaneous exchange of cheques between GASCOR, ESSO/BHP, and the Commonwealth will be made on the payment day. However, if the payment to Victoria is not able to be made on the contracted day, the Commonwealth has agreed to pay to Victoria an additional amount reflecting interest accruing up to the actual payment date.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The agreement also puts in place a mechanism to ensure that should future events mean that the assessed tax payable on the settlement amount is changed, this will be reflected in a corresponding flow of funds between the parties. It is designed to ensure the Commonwealth would be no better or worse off under these circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The resolution of this dispute, in a manner acceptable to all parties is to be welcomed. Passage of this special appropriation bill will facilitate the settlement process. It is also expected that the resolution of this dispute will facilitate the opening up of gas markets in Victoria to the benefit of gas consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the explanatory memorandum which contains an explanation of the provisions of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In relation to Appropriation Bill (No. 1) a major issue is the inequity of the government's budget program. First of all, the teacher professional development program has been cut by $17 million. This simply maintains the item at approximately the same level as last year's appropriation. In relation to teacher programs, teachers are under more pressure than others with government cuts, larger class sizes and so on. It does not make any sense to cut professional development in that way. It is not that the states are necessari <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5813"> ly going to have the extra money to provide that, because their funds are being cut as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under environment, in relation to the costs of the Great Barrier Reef, the government is pulling money out of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, which does not make any sense considering the same government said that they want to protect the environment by seeing how many reef fish you can take out by not totally destroying the reef. To protect the Great Barrier Reef we want to maintain at least $1 million in funding. This measure is very mean spirited.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under health, $15 million allocated to maintenance maintains funding at approximately the real level of last year's appropriation. There was a slight budgetary increase, but it is actually a real decrease in national health. In therapeutic goods, the government proposes effectively to reduce access to therapeutic goods. This is just maintaining the real dollar line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about the Commonwealth dental program? This is the administrative component, the running cost of the scheme found in Appropriation Bill (No. 1). We introduce it here because it was left out of the requests of other parties. We are happy to support the request for the dental program reinstatement from the other parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To reduce the waiting time for elective surgery, we would need an increase of $3 million. Once again, we have seen a mean-spirited proposal. If you are talking about such things as efficiency, you wonder how it might seem to the person who is having to wait longer on the queue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once again, what about reinstatement for the national health program, rehabilitation services, transport and regional development? In spite of all their rhetoric in terms of their commitment to regional Australia, this government has gutted funding for regional and local development. This is just a re-establishment of that level of funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The re-establishment of the national urban development program, once again, is important for equity and reducing oil dependency in relation to greenhouse reductions. I know this government is busy selling coal as fast as it <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> can but, in fact, the international community is expecting Australia to pull up its socks and do better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the integrated local area planning and coastal management, we have had another mean&hyphen;spirited response. We want to increase the funding by $1 million, which sets it at last year's level. For better urban design, we would need an increase of $10 million. Greenhouse effects, urban public transport and so on, we would need a $5 million increase.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there is the National Railways Commission. It makes no sense to cut railways when we are heading to what, I believe, is a petroleum crisis. This proposed increase brings it to last year's funding level. Last year's program may have terminated, but rail <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5814"> is important and should be substantially improved for energy and farming and mining and industry. If those are industries that you want to support, it does not make any sense to decrease the funding for railways.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there is the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. We have a lot of debates in here in relation to the quality of the work done by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. We are not going to be able to maintain that quality if we cut their funding. It will reduce their ability to do the work that they do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I commend the request for amendments to the Senate. Therefore, I move:</PARA>

Firstly, Senator Alston came in here after question time with his tail between his legs to indicate what I think was a very serious error that he made in the conduct of his ministerial duties in that he misled the Senate in relation to job losses in Telstra in Tasmania. He got it very badly wrong. The two per cent&mdash;according to Senator Alston&mdash;job losses, the 28 jobs in Tasmania, turn out in reality to be at least eight per cent job losses.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5K4">Senator FAULKNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was miserable. It was basically as ungenerous and vindictive as you would expect. What the then Labor government had to do was go through a series of 12 divisions in this place to right the wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to say to Senator Alston, Senator Hill, the current Manager of Government Business and the former Manager of Government Business, whom you had the good sense to dump, that that is not the way we do business. I hope that the pattern has become entrenched, with the opposition showing good sense in terms of the procedures and processes in this place. I hope in the future we will see the same approach if a Labor senator misses a division. And I note that it is more and more becoming the practice, depending on which side of the chamber they are voting, for the Democrats to be paired for a division. It is a perfectly reasonable demand from the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say that this is not the spirit you have demonstrated in the past. It is not the way you do business. It is about time you thought very carefully in your own party room about some of those issues. I am pleased that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) from the other chamber has come in here to tell this mob how to run the show. He might not be much good over there, but he has to be better than the way this mob operates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make that as a very serious point to the government in terms of the way we do business and the way that they have done business in the past. It is a serious situation to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5820"> have a vote recommitted because the Assistant Treasurer of Australia was on the telephone and did not believe it significant enough for the regional economic development program of the budget to be taken to a vote. That is what happened just now. It was not important enough for the Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate to come into the chamber and vote on the cut to the Commonwealth dental health program for health card holders. I genuinely believe the cut to that program is without doubt the most despicable, the most contemptible, the most vicious and vindictive in this budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are talking about is administrative money and running costs. When we get to Appropriation Bill (No. 2), we will be able to deal with the substance of the program. This request before the committee at the moment is about running costs. I can assure the government that we are serious about the dental health program. We are serious about seeing the program reinstated for the disadvantaged, underprivileged and low income people in our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are serious about the dental health benefits that this program delivers, and we are serious about proper process in this chamber. It is for that reason that, if Senator Alston rises to his feet to ask for leave for this particular matter to be recommitted, from the opposition's perspective we will grant leave. But I hope he and the government understand the spirit with which the opposition will grant leave.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope, Senator Alston, that you have found both your misleading of the parliament earlier in the day and this most recent experience of missing an important division in this place in the committee stage of the appropriation bills a sufficiently humiliating and humbling experience. I hope you will give some consideration to that experience in the way you and your colleagues on the front bench approach your parliamentary responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is for those reasons that the opposition will grant leave for this question to be put to the committee again, if Senator Alston asks for leave. But, let me say, we will be demanding, if and when an opposition senator or a senator paired with the opposition misses <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a division, which has happened once&mdash;out of the last six occasions we have had a senator miss a division&mdash;not to have the miserable response that we have had previously from the coalition. The Labor Party has had to right the wrong through 12 divisions. On the five occasions your side have dropped the ball, when your own team has let you down, you have been granted leave by the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Think about it. Think about the difference between the way we operate and the way you operate. Think about the difference between our respect for this parliamentary institution and yours.</PARA></SPEECH>

I have asked the committee beforehand if we could narrow up and possibly get through one or two matters that the House of Representatives might consider.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The first request relates to medical research institutes capital funding. Medical research institutes are important. Australia has a reputation for reasonably good medical <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> research. This could be interpreted as an anti-intellectual campaign against research in education as well as an attack on the quality of health. National public health was de creased in real terms. This request maintains it. A further matter is reducing waiting times for elective services. Waiting time is an central issue in public hospitals. With a $3 million cut from Appropriation Bill (No. 1), this makes for a $23 million reduction in funding for reducing waiting time. It is not acceptable, and I do not think it will be acceptable to the general public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of Medicare agreements and other health services, Medicare has never been a program favoured by the government. The reduction here will effectively result in increased costs for services for people on Medicare. A number of government initiatives are designed to make Medicare payments a base payment on top of which an increasing level of supplementary payments are added by doctors. Limiting doctors and limiting an increase in Medicare coverage creates pressure for doctors to move from bulk-billing to billing with top&hyphen;up payments that must be paid in full by patients, who then must take the receipts to the Medicare office to get a partial refund. It is the kind of thing that Senator Crowley was talking about today and which Senator Panizza found difficult to understand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another issue is referral services for women escaping domestic violence in rural and remote areas. Well, how mean can you get! We are asking for the funding to be maintained by $0.5 million. This service is an item where underspending has been common and where there seems to have been a general unwillingness to implement policies, and this means both governments. Unfortunately, domestic violence is on the upswing, particularly in rural areas, where it often results from isolation, a lack of employment and increasing difficulties and so on. We believe that it is entirely appropriate to maintain funding for this item. It is not a big ask.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the social housing subsidy program, we are asking for $3.5 million. We started to provide recurrent funding to the states for financing rental accommodation and shared equity programs for low and moderate income earners. Last year, the program was refocused to develop the policy of private sector leasing, which I disagreed with. It <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5828"> included schemes, such as in New South Wales, to buy and build 260 dwellings that would be used for community housing schemes. The government has cut this program and is pushing instead for private sector provision. I disagree with the move to private sector leasing on public housing. I do not think any moves to provide funding for community housing or rental housing for low income earners should be cut back.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another issue is the implementation of the noise amelioration program for Sydney airport. That is fairly self&hyphen;explanatory. This maintains funding at the current level. The people of Sydney would be pretty ratted off that it is not being kept up to that level. In terms of the national mental health program, $30 million is being asked for. The mental health program has been discontinued. This is not appropriate at all, given the problems of mental health and the problems created when mental patients are pushed into halfway houses. We do not think the situation is acceptable. It is not acceptable for the government to terminate the national mental health program without replacement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The residential care for older people program involves $2.5 million. This is simply another example of government attacking the most vulnerable sectors of the community. Our request is that the funding stay at least at the nominal level of last year's funding. The supported accommodation assistance program is within the crisis accommodation program. The supported accommodation assistance program has been designed for a range of people who would otherwise not be able to afford or have access to basic housing. I therefore ask the Senate to support our requests for amendment to Appropriation Bill (No. 2).</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was, I think, good of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator Campbell) the other day, when dealing with the industrial relations bill, to acknowledge that the judges of this court were of the foremost quality and that they had, in effect, performed their functions in a quite outstanding way. Fortunately, those judges will now go into the Federal Court. They were all members of that court and they will carry out their functions in that jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I noticed in the report that the retirements of Justices Northrop and Keely have been referred to. In recent times, they have turned 70 years old. They were quite outstanding judges and quite outstanding barristers when they were at the Victorian bar and I would like to acknowledge my respect, and no doubt the respect of the Senate and the parliament, for the work that they have done. Also, I notice that during the year there was appointed from the Victorian bar Justice Shane Marshall and Justice Anthony North&mdash;or Tony, as he was known&mdash;quite outstanding advocates and people who, had the court remained, would have proved great judges of the industrial court. I have no doubt that they will become great judges of the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the previous government showed great initiative in setting up this court. Senator Cook, who has had vast experience in the industrial area, would agree with me. He was a member of the cabinet that set up this court.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to identify myself with the remarks of Senator Cooney with respect to this report. Senator Cooney has lauded the establishment of the Industrial Relations Court and, rightfully in my view, identified, acknowledged and praised the very fine work of many of the learned and distinguished judges who have sat on the bench of the industrial court. This was, as Senator Cooney said, an initiative of the former government. At the time that this court was legislated for, I had the honour of being the Minister for Industrial Relations and presented that legislation to the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, indeed. It was nonetheless I as the first person in the collective of the government who had the honour of doing it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important on this occasion to reflect just a little on some of the underpinning reasons why an industrial court, rather than an extended bench of the Federal Court, was the chosen format of the former government. One of those key reasons was touched on by Senator Cooney himself when he said that industrial law is a discrete practice of its own. It certainly is. If you blend it with all of the other responsibilities of the Federal Court, it would be wrong to automatically assume that the Federal Court's mind will not be as competent as that of an industrial court. I certainly do not make that allegation. The Federal Court is an extraordinarily competent jurisdiction. It is nonetheless true that over time judges sitting in this discrete area of law as an industrial court hone their sensitivities <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5831"> and knowledge of this area of law more expertly than will judges sitting in a wide jurisdiction such as the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The argument that has been put by those from the conservative side of politics&mdash;that industrial relations should not be treated separately but be part of the wide practice of law&mdash;is fallacious in the sense that the argument is often mounted as if industrial relations were just another part of trade or industry or corporate law. It is not. Industrial relations is not just a mechanistic operation. It involves people in the workplace interacting together and disputes arising with very potent legal implications between them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think you can practise industrial law with the same mind&hyphen;set as would be brought to other areas of the law, for the very sound reason that the human factor is a much more potent consideration here than it might be in other areas where the dispassionate mind of a bench can direct itself. So I think there is an extremely good case to have a bench dedicated to this field of legal practice. I do think not immediately but over the longer haul the ability of Australian jurists to come to grips with some of the underpinnings of industrial relations will weaken, and that will make the nation weaker.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you for that interjection, Senator Cooney. We are now embarking on a voyage of discovery in Australia with the new industrial relations act. Many things have been claimed for this act. Very few things about those claims are proven. A lot of those things claimed are theoretical. They do not have any basis in practical experience. It is at that very time that you will need a bench able to thread its way through the complexity of this field of jurisdiction and across the precedent more than any other.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The information referred to in the Report provides no sound evidence of deficiencies in Australian Customs Service processing of goods subject to this control.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In recommending a single facility, the Committee seems to confound the particular and exclusive requirements for safe storage of the various categories of radioactive waste. Nevertheless, the Government accepts in principle the recommendation of a storage facility for long lived intermediate level waste (Category S waste) which is not suitable for near&hyphen;surface disposal. This would include waste to be returned from reprocessing of Australian research reactor fuel at Dounreay (Scotland). Establishment of such a facility will be raised in the Commonwealth/State Consultative Committee on Radioactive Waste Management to assess the extent of State and Territory support for the proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For low level and short&hyphen;lived intermediate level radioactive waste, international standards and practice clearly indicate that near&hyphen;surface disposal is appropriate rather than storage as recommended by the Committee. Accordingly, the Government intends to proceed with the study commenced by our predecessors to identify a disposal site for low level and short&hyphen;lived intermediate level radioactive waste. The study will also consider the proposal that this repository be co&hyphen;located with an above ground storage facility for long lived intermediate level waste in order to secure the benefits of shared infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In recommending above&hyphen;ground storage of all categories of radioactive waste (Recommendation 17 and Paragraphs 6.47 and 6.57), the Senate Committee has given considerable weight to the hope that technology will be developed for destruction of radioactive materials. Transmutation may eventually be possible in the context of high level actinide wastes from the reprocessing of spent nuclear power reactor fuel. However, it is unrealistic to expect this technique to be applied to low&hyphen;level wastes. In any case, transmutation still results in some radioactive tails being produced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is also evidence in the Committee's report of confusion between "disposal" and "storage" of radioactive waste. For example the Committee contends that: <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">"The international nuclear community has been unable to come up with an answer on how to dispose of radioactive waste other than that classified as exempt"</EMPHASIS> . This is patently incorrect. Many near&hyphen;surface disposal facilities for low&hyphen;level <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5835"> and short&hyphen;lived intermediate level wastes are operating overseas at present as acknowledged by the Committee (Paragraphs 6.69, 6.73, 6.74).

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to respond to the government's response to the report of the Senate Select Committee on Dangers of Radioactive Waste. It is at least pleasing to see that the government have noted a lot of the recommendations. They have not thrown them out of hand but will consider a number of the recommendations. There are still some unsatisfactory responses, and that includes the important recommendation No. 17 that a national above&hyphen;ground storage facility be established with the capacity to take low, intermediate and high level radioactive waste.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My personal view in relation to storage facilities was mentioned in the dissenting report that was signed by former Senator Bell. I was not of the opinion that there should be a national repository. I thought it would be more appropriate to have state based, locally based or in situ based properly designed facilities. While we still do not know how to handle radioactive waste, we certainly cannot dispose of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government accepts in principle the recommendation of a storage facility for long lived intermediate level waste which is not suitable for near surface disposal. It would seem that they are looking at that for waste such as that to be returned from reprocessing of Australia's research reactor fuel at Dounreay. I certainly would not like to see us burying that. I think it would be correct to say that we should have an above&hyphen;ground, properly engineered facility for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the government response states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For low level and short&hyphen;lived intermediate level radioactive waste, international standards and practice clearly indicate that near&hyphen;surface disposal&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>for which read `burial'&hyphen;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is appropriate . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Low level does not necessarily mean short term. So you have low level and short lived intermediate level radioactive waste.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the problems that came out during the inquiry was that a lot was lumped in together in relation to radioactive waste. In fact, most of what the government considers as waste in Australia is classified as low level <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and short lived intermediate level radioactive waste. So, with the exception of the waste that we will get back from the fuel rods from Dounreay&mdash;lucky us!&mdash;it seems that they are still talking about digging a hole and burying most of the rest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not consider that that is properly engineered. In Esk in Queensland they do have a facility which is engineered. It cost them a few million dollars&mdash;not a huge amount of money&mdash;but it is monitored and regularly controlled. They do seem to have taken a great deal of care to try to get the community involved in the process. I would not say that all of the community are thoroughly enamoured of the idea, but at least they have worked on dealing with the level of community concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think a dollar&hyphen;driven approach to dealing with radioactive waste&mdash;which is what this seems to be at this stage&mdash;is ever going to meet community approval anywhere in Australia. I know that, during some of the hearings, one community group said, `Don't worry, we don't want it, but Western Australia does.' I can guarantee you that the vast majority of the community in the goldfields does not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is partly due to the fact that there is this assumption that when radioactive waste is out of sight it is out of mind. The people who would like to make money out of accepting radioactive waste are certainly not going to be around for the thousands upon thousands of years that that radioactive waste stays active. They are certainly not going to have to deal with it. They may think that, if they dig a hole and put trees on the top, people will forget that it is there after a while. Perhaps they will, but it will still be there. We have not yet found ways of dealing with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also disappointed to see that recommendation 18 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the national facility be adequately engineered to withstand all possible climatic conditions, no matter how unlikely.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not think that is an unreasonable thing. At a time when there is a growing consensus about climatic change, you should not, for instance, choose an area in what is generally <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5837"> an arid zone and engineer the facility working on the assumption that the area is arid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even the goldfields area in Western Australia, often considered a target point for governments wanting to get rid of waste of all sorts, cannot be guaranteed to be arid. They have had some quite substantial rainfall events within the last two years. They may have been one in 100 year events, but two or three occurred in the last year. The indications are that there is a band of rainfall which is more likely to happen in areas like the goldfields due to climatic change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the committee was asking that you do not go just on the law of averages and say, `This place is generally arid, let's produce a facility and engineer it for what we would like to think it might generally be.' I do not think that is smart and I do not think that is meeting the needs of the community. Heavy rainfall and floods do occur around the goldfields from time to time, as Senator Panizza would know.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you wanted to get the community on side, the way to do it is not by saying, `We will engineer this facility on the assumption that this is an arid area.' I am not offering the goldfields in any manner, way or form. Although the government continues to say that it is going to ensure a thorough safety assessment, it is not making people feel very assured at the moment considering it is still saying things like, `"Adequately engineered" means we looked for an area which is distant from large communities and has an arid climate.' I do not think that is acceptable to the people living in those areas and I do not think that it is an acceptable method of risk assessment, especially in a time when there is ample and growing evidence of climatic change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to mention briefly another point. The government's response devotes an entire five lines to the not insubstantial dissenting report. It does not deal with the issues&mdash;it just says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the dissenting report exaggerates the potential hazards presented by the radioactive waste produced in Australia and takes an unduly pessimistic view of management options . . .  <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>It does not deal with the issues. It does not deal with the points. It does not answer my concerns nor those of former Senator Bell and the great number of people who gave written and oral evidence to the inquiry. I find that very disappointing and I will follow up with questions to the relevant minister to find out why such an inadequate response to those serious concerns was considered to be appropriate in relation to such an important issue. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The resolutions adopted by the UNGA and CHR, which Australia co&hyphen;sponsors, make specific reference to the need to ensure the physical integrity of prisoners and to eliminate the practice of torture.   The resolution on Burma adopted by the 51st session of the Commission on Human Rights has a specific clause reminding the Government of its obligation to put an end to the impunity of perpetrators of violations of human rights, its responsibility to investigate alleged cases of human rights violations, to bring them to justice and to prosecute and punish those found guilty (1995/72, operative paragraph 12).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CHR resolution 1995/72, which Australia co&hyphen;sponsored, makes specific reference to measures which have been taken by the Government of Burma in co&hyphen;ordination with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to provide training of military personnel in international humanitarian law, and requests it to intensify its efforts in that regard and to extend them to police and prison personnel. In an apparent response to pressure by the international community, Burma has ratified the Geneva Conventions, and the ICRC has undertaken a series of training programs to sensitise the Burmese Armed Forces to the implications of this action.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While these are encouraging developments, the Australian Government recognises that there is considerable scope for much greater activity in this area. We will continue to urge the Government of Burma to develop policies and programs, with the assistance of international agencies, that will further educate relevant officials in humanitarian law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has strongly and repeatedly urged the Burmese Government to agree to providing the ICRC full, repeated and confidential access to prisoners in all Burmese gaols. It is a co&hyphen;sponsor of UNGA and CHR resolutions urging the Burmese Government to co&hyphen;operate fully with the ICRC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Government was disappointed to learn in June last year that negotiations between the ICRC and the Government of Burma on access to political detainees by the ICRC broke down after several years of discussion. The ICRC stated that the reply it received from the SLORC to its offer of services was "not satisfactory, as it took no <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5840"> account of the customary procedures for visits to places of detention followed by the ICRC in all the countries where it conducts such activities."  On receipt of this response the ICRC informed the Government of Burma that it acknowledged the failure of the negotiations and would close its office in Rangoon in July 1995. The ICRC said that "it was prepared to resume the dialogue on a constructive basis as soon as the Myanmar authorities invited it to do so."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Government registered with the Government of Burma, through its Embassy in Rangoon, its strong disappointment with the failure of the negotiations and its hope that the negotiations would resume and reach a satisfactory conclusion that permitted the ICRC access to prisons. We understand that while agreement on access has not been reached, the Government of Burma has not ruled out the possibility of agreement and there is scope for negotiations to resume. The Australian Government will continue to urge the Government of Burma to resume negotiations with the ICRC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Government will also continue to make bilateral representations about specific detention cases.

While it is difficult to assess accurately the extent to which uniform application of this directive has occurred, the decision indicates that the Burmese authorities are responsive both to internal opposition to the demands of corvee labour and to expressions of international concern at the continuation of the practice.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Government supports international action to address the trafficking issue and shares the growing concern in the international community regarding the exploitation of women in the sex industry.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is aware of international meetings of non&hyphen;government organisations and individuals <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> concerned about the growing international traffic in women were held in Manila and Brussels in March 1993.

The Government is considering what further work might be done to develop a new Convention on trafficking which makes the distinction between forced prostitution and prostitution entered into voluntarily.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important to note that one major obstacle in tackling the issue of trafficking is the lack of any authenticated data available to determine the extent of the problem. For this reason, decriminalisation of prostitution should be considered as a viable strategy in the elimination of trafficking. Decriminalisation would provide an avenue for monitoring the conditions of prostitution. Such a position is in keeping with the distinction in the Convention to Eliminate All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW)  between the exploitation of prostitution and prostitution <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">per se</EMPHASIS> . Decriminalisation would also assist in shifting the focus of prosecution away from women subjected to trafficking and towards the organisers of trafficking (see (b) below).</PARA>

Given the events of late November 1995 the possibility of increased NLD participation in the National Convention now appears even more remote. Following the resumption of the National Convention on 28 November 1995 the NLD announced that it was suspending its participation in the Convention because the SLORC had not responded to its call for a dialogue. In the absence of a dialogue the NLD view was that it would not be possible for the National Convention to successfully achieve its aim of drafting a constitution consonant with democratic principles that would lead to a genuine multiparty democracy. On 30 November the Panel of Chairmen of the National Convention revoked the delegate status of the NLD delegates. The decision was made pursuant to the Convention procedures which permitted revocation of delegate status if a delegate was absent without leave for two consecutive days.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 9 November 1994, the Senate asked the Committee to inquire and report on : <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5855"> </PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The administration and management of all aspects of the operation of the Australian Quarantine (and) Inspection Service"</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following receipt of written submissions, the Committee conducted extensive public hearings. Its report was tabled in May 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 14 December 1995, the former Government announced an independent Committee of Review of Australia's animal and plant quarantine policies and programs&mdash;the Nairn Committee. Its terms of reference also cover some of the issues addressed by the Senate Committee. On taking office, this Government strengthened the scientific capacity of the Review Committee through the appointment of one extra member. The membership of the Committee and its terms of reference are attached (Attachment A &amp; B). The Committee is to report in November 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As this is the first major scientific review of Australia's quarantine systems since the Lindsay Committee reported in 1987, the Government will consider those recommendations of the Senate Committee which deal with quarantine policy issues in the context of its examination of the Nairn Committee Report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate Committee report has been provided to the Nairn Committee for its consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government endorses the view of the Committee that a strong and effective AQIS is central to our dual goals of maintaining an effective quarantine system that protects our advantageous plant, animal and human health status and increasingly building on our reputation as a provider of safe, high quality food products to world markets.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 1:</EMPHASIS>  <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The Committee recommends that AQIS should ensure that industry is fully aware of the costs associated with providing services and the methodology used to recover them.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response : Agreed. AQIS will continue to convene its Industry Charging Review Committees to ensure that all members of relevant industry organisations are kept fully informed on costs and methodology used to determine AQIS charges.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 2: The Committee recommends that AQIS carefully monitor the effects of the implementation of third party delivery arrangements, particularly during the first year of operation. AQIS should give particular consideration to the effect, both in terms of charges payable and efficiency of documentation provision, on exporters not based in major centres</EMPHASIS> .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response : Agreed. Since the Committee's report AQIS has introduced third party auditing provisions <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> into its Dairy export program and third party inspections into its Live Animal export program, in both cases with the full support of the relevant industries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are contrary views within the horticulture industry as to the benefits of third party inspection systems. Accordingly, AQIS has not implemented the proposed system pending further consideration of the issues by the Government and further consultation with industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 3: The Committee recommends that AQIS develop strategies to better explain and disseminate information on its risk analysis and management approach to quarantine and inspection.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response : The Nairn Committee is examining the basis of Quarantine Policy in Australia. It is considering the current approach to risk management processes. The Government's response to the Nairn Committee will inform and explain future approaches to quarantine decision making by AQIS.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 4: The Committee recommends that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, recognising that scientific and technical expertise must increasingly underpin the operations of AQIS particularly in quarantine, undertake a review of AQIS's resources and capacities and, if necessary, increase staffing and resources.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response : Agreed. This is being addressed by the Nairn Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 5: The Committee is concerned that the scientific research on the basis of which AQIS must make an assessment of risk should be comprehensive and relevant to Australian conditions. The Committee recommends that assessments of risk should not be made until such research has been done.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response : Agreed in principle. Quarantine decision making must be based on the best available scientific and technical information. That expertise however, does not always reside in Australia; nor is it feasible in every case to ensure that research is "comprehensive and relevant to Australian conditions."  Often, this would require the importation of live viruses to test their impact in Australia, which may represent a greater risk than the importation of the product itself.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In quarantine decision making it is usual for there to be incomplete scientific data available to aid assessment. This lack of data can relate to how the disease in question could be established and maintained in the Australian environment. The Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Agreement allows conservative measures to be implemented where there are significant information gaps. This is consistent with the approach AQIS has taken. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5856"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 6: The Committee recommends that AQIS should have wide&hyphen;ranging consultations with relevant industry groups before publishing a draft IRA. The Committee considers that such an approach will protect the integrity of AQIS's scientific reputation, reduce the likelihood of protracted and acrimonious debates, and ensure stable investment environments in the relevant industries.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response : Future processes for the conduct of major risk analyses will be determined in light of the Nairn Committee Report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 7: The Committee recommends that AQIS review NAQS in order to ensure that any incursion will automatically trigger coordinated and clear strategies and responses. These should include contingency plans, consultation and coordination between State and Federal agencies. The Committee considers that this is a significant lesson that can be learned from the incursion of the papaya fruit fly.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response : AQIS commissioned a review of NAQS in January 1995. The review was carried out by Professor Malcolm Nairn and Dr Ian Muirhead and the report was presented to AQIS in August 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the wake of the papaya fruit fly incursion and Japanese Encephalitis outbreak in 1995, the Government has agreed to strengthen AQIS activity in Northern Australia, including the NAQS program</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> additional resources totalling $14.6m have been provided for a range of <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> activities over the next three and a half years to June 1999, including increased <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> scientific effort, increased resourcing for Torres Strait and Cape York <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> quarantine border activity, and an expansion of public awareness.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">NAQS is collaborating with QDPI in developing an on&hyphen;going containment strategy for the papaya fruit fly and other exotic fruit flies in the Torres Strait, under the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Resource Management (SCARM) auspices. The program is to be carried out by NAQS, under contract from QDPI which retains the primary responsibility for response to incursions. NAQS is developing projects to address the risks posed by other high&hyphen;risk pests such as red&hyphen;banded mango caterpillar, mango weevil and banana skipper. Research projects are being commissioned into monitoring and detection methods for Japanese encephalitis, screw&hyphen;worm fly and Asian honey bee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the SCARM has established a Task Force on Incursion Management to identify key exotic pests for which surveillance is to be undertaken and develop early warning systems and to update emergency response plans to manage exotic plant and animal disease incursions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 8: Other matters relating to quarantine were raised during the Committee's <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> hearings in Cairns.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> investigate whether it is appropriate and feasible to establish a quarantine post at the Jardine River, Far North Queensland;</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> ensure that Commonwealth departments with responsibility for land management issues, including wilderness and native title, are aware of relevant quarantine concerns and strategies.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response : In considering whether to establish a quarantine control point at the Jardine River, it is relevant that the river itself is not a natural barrier to birds, insects and other animals which either fly or swim across or can walk across in the Dry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the strengthening of quarantine operations in the Torres Strait and Northern Peninsular region it is not considered that a checkpoint at the Jardine River would be required for international quarantine reasons. Notwithstanding this, a major public information campaign funded by AQIS is in place in the Northern Peninsular area involving FM radio announcements, brochure distribution, announcements on ferries and signage in campgrounds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Queensland Government is responsible for intra State quarantine issues. They advise that papaya fruit fly (PFF) road&hyphen;block inspections at Laura, on Cape York Peninsular Development Road, began stopping motorists heading south through the road&hyphen;block from August 16 1996 to further restrict the possible movement of plant pests and diseases from the Peninsular area. The inspectors are presently undergoing training to enable them to detect high risk fruits, plants and plant material. The move was prompted by the recent detection of black sigatoka disease in banana plants at Weipa and industry concerns that the disease could inadvertently be transported to major growing areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AQIS has written to Commonwealth departments and agencies responsible for land management issues, including wilderness and native title, alerting them to relevant quarantine matters and strategies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 9: The Committee recommends that, as a matter of priority, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy establish a task force, comprising relevant government officers, industry groups, in particular representatives of the meat industry, union officials and other relevant parties to identify and address critical issues in industrial relations between industry and AQIS with a view to achieving a co&hyphen;operative working relationship based on efficiency, flexibility, trust and good&hyphen;will. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5857"> </EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response: The Government is committed to reform of AQIS's meat inspection program to ensure it delivers an efficient and effective service to industry. A statement outlining future processes for implementing the necessary reforms is attached (Attachment C).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 10: The Committee recommends that, as a matter of priority, AQIS carry out its commitment to the Committee to extend workshops on client focus to all staff. The effectiveness of these programs, particularly in relation to the prevention of situations such as developed at the Traralgon abattoir, should be closely monitored and, where necessary, follow up programs should be instituted and the Committee informed of the results to enable it to make its own assessment.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response : There are five major elements to AQIS's Client Focus Program of which client focus workshops are one element. The program also included a client feedback system, the development of a charter of service, client surveys, workshops and assisting clients to improve their access to export markets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In March 1994, the then Minister announces the implementation of the Client Feedback system. AQIS has distributed over 20,000 pamphlets to clients encouraging their use of the system. The system allows clients to have direct access to senior departmental and AQIS management, where they feel this is necessary. Most matters referred to AQIS, however, have been able to be dealt with effectively by the relevant senior managers in AQIS's regional operations. The AQIS Client Feedback pamphlet was recently updated and re&hyphen;released in September 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second element of the client focus program is the development of a charter of service for AQIS. This will reflect AQIS's commitment to its industry clients in relation to its services and document performance standards by which AQIS services can be judged. The charter had been developed in general framework form and is currently being redrafted into more program specific forms to include commitments specific to AQIS service units which establish both quantifiable as well as qualitative service standards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The third element of the client focus program is a process of formal client surveys. These provide a structured process of feedback on aspects of AQIS's operations. An initial pilot survey of the export meat industry and import brokers was conducted during 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During 1995 and 1996, these surveys were split into 3 phases. Phase 1 involved fish (land&hyphen;based), dairy, eggs, dried fruit, poultry and domestic meat industries and was completed in September 1995. Phase 2 involves imported foods, customs agents, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> import clearance and live animals. The final report from this phase should be completed by the end of November 1996. Phase 3 involves horticulture, grains and export meat and is expected to commence in November 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fourth element of the client focus program are staff workshops and training. During November and December 1994, 270 staff participated in pilot workshops to improve their understanding of what the client focus program is all about and to assist the development of a charter of service. They were also to provide the basis for future training for all staff and the development of associated training materials. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The client focus kits developed as training materials for these workshops have been updated. The kits provide a resource tool for senior managers throughout AQIS to use in an integrated way during the course of regular training and development activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, competency based training programs have been developed for quarantine inspection staff who have transferred from State to Commonwealth based employment during the last twelve months and for new recruits. This course incorporates several modules on important elements in providing better quality service to AQIS clients. These include Communication Skills (21 hrs formal training and 10 hrs on&hyphen;the&hyphen;job training); Conflict Management, Negotiation and Liaison Skills (14 hrs formal training and 14 hrs on&hyphen;the&hyphen;job training) and Client Service Delivery (7 hrs formal training and 14 hrs on&hyphen;the&hyphen;job training).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An important part of AQIS's initial training and development activities in relation to client focus activities had been to concentrate on fraud and ethics training for all field based staff. This has been undertaken by the Business Ethics and Security Investigations Unit (BESIU) of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. It covers the Australian Public Service `Guidelines of Official Conduct' and uses tailored case studies to examine such issues as conflict of interest and acceptance of gifts and benefits. A pilot course was conducted in SA in late 1995&mdash;with full implementation of the course commencing in January 1996. To date, over 400 staff have participated in the training. It is intended to deliver the training to the remaining AQIS staff within the next eight months.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fifth element of the client focus program is a more pro&hyphen;active approach to assisting Australian industries gain or improve access to export markets. It involves sitting down with particular industries to identify technical barriers to Australian exports and assisting them to work through importing country requirements. This is being reinforced with additional resources going into the `Supermarket to Asia' concept. The Government has agreed to provide funding to AQIS for this program to the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5858"> extent of $2 million per year over the next three years. AQIS will allocate these funds to technical market access activities and other identified priority issues. Some resources will also be devoted to stationing AQIS officers in Asia to implement and facilitate the program on the ground.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The continued implementation of a client focus program along the lines outlined represents an integrated response to the Committee's recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 11: The Committee recommends that the Government undertake a review of staffing and resource levels, so that the integrity of Australia's quarantine and inspection services can be maintained. The Committee also makes specific recommendations on staffing and resources in relation to scientific and technical expertise, and international liaison.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the Committee reported, the Government has</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> allocated an additional $14.6 million to enhance scientific, technical and operational resources in Northern Australia over the period to 1998&hyphen;99;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> increased funding for the Airports program to enhance quarantine security from the $11.054 million allocated by the former Government in the 1995&hyphen;96 Budget to $14.325 million in 1996&hyphen;97 rising to $16.359 million in 1999&hyphen;2000;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> allocated an extra $6 million over the next three years from 1996&hyphen;97 to employ additional scientific and technical staff to address technical barriers to market access for Australian exports into Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other resources issues will be considered, as necessary, when the Nairn Committee has reported.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 12: The Committee recommends that AQIS develop and maintain more effective channels of communication to on&hyphen;site inspectors, ensuring that they are routinely informed of the outcomes of the investigation of matters raised by them and whatever remedial action has been taken.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response : Agreed. AQIS, through its Compliance program has implemented a variety of systems to improve communications with on&hyphen;site inspectors in relation to feedback on incident reports lodged. These enhanced systems include new written notifications, a regular Compliance newsletter and more emphasis on personal contact and understanding between Compliance and Inspectorial staff.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When an incident report is lodged with the Compliance program by on&hyphen;site inspectors, the Regional Compliance Manager acknowledges receipt in writing to the on&hyphen;site AQIS officer. Often Compliance staff and inspection staff discuss these issues over the telephone or meet in person to clarify and progress resolution of incident reports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Compliance program is also working to improve interpersonal communications through an <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> enhanced approach to investigation of incidents which indicate the existence of systemic problems. Compliance staff are more often working directly with on&hyphen;site inspection staff in investigations or providing assistance at operational task groups.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Compliance newsletter has been developed and is distributed fortnightly to each of the program groups. The newsletter covers items of interest, prosecution results and general items of interest concerning investigation and Compliance activity. This newsletter has been well received by field staff.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All AQIS staff must ensure that communication processes are continually improved as the organisation moves from the traditional command control inspection systems to the new team based quality and HACCP based systems. Whilst the Compliance program is working to ensure feedback to inspection staff the requirements of the criminal justice system must be complied with and the integrity of the privacy of clients protected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 13: The Committee recommends that AQIS urgently review how its procedures and performance contributed to the adverse findings of the US Food Safety &amp; Inspection Service review of Australian export meat establishments. The Committee further recommends that the implementation of the results of this review must be given the highest priority to ensure continuing and sustained operational compliance to Australian Export Meat Orders and overseas requirements.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response:  Consequent to the USDA review of November/December 1995 AQIS immediately met with the Australian meat processing industry and developed a comprehensive Scheme for Corrective Action (SCA) which contains modified procedures and some new procedures with immediate and long term objectives. The essential elements of the SCA are :</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the use of performance triggers to identify establishments with apparent performance problems which are then subjected to intensified AQIS review and categorised according to findings.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>I will briefly comment that we will no longer be seeing any major, significant financial reports from that part of that department called Regional Development because it was basically abolished by this government in July&hyphen;August this year. It just indicates the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> commitment that this coalition has to regional development&mdash;no care and no consideration. It was done in a most callous, off&hyphen;hand way; they reduced the staff from 220 to six. It has a budget now of $5 million but we do not know what the criterion is for how that budget will be expended. I am still waiting for questions on notice to be answered to explain what that criterion is going to be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now the department disagrees with me and they disagreed with me during the estimates hearing when I asked how they could continue to maintain the name of the Department of Transport and Regional Development when, in fact, they had abolished the Regional Development. They informed me, `No, Senator, there were still six staff there; so there is a presence but it is a minute one.' How you can have part of a department's title for six people is quite beyond me but what the impact is going to be on rural and regional areas of this country has yet to be estimated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The regional development program it had undertaken was getting regions together&mdash;getting groups of councils and interested people active and involved and caring about their communities and working out the priorities for the development and the future of their region. That has ceased. The funding to those organisations has been cut back dramatically. In a very short time, some of them will be running out of funding and not be up for any recurrent funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the callous, uncaring sort of attitude you see from this government . You see it very clearly because we know that the National Party members are very concerned about regional development. We see their Liberal colleagues just walking right over them, taking no notice of them and abolishing things that are of benefit to the bush. The government is to be condemned for this. It is very sad when you read through the Senate estimates <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> and discover just how the department was abolished, just how people were told they had no jobs and were going to be forced to take redundancies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It happened when one afternoon the minister made the decision, went over and told the people. Some were away at staff development conferences. This is a great way <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5862"> to have staff development, to be told you are going to get the DCM&mdash;don't come Monday. It is very sad that department completed its wind&hyphen;up this week. When the announcement was made, the Public Service certainly attempted to get its support mechanisms there to help people. That did not happen until the next day, so people were forced to go home, to have to tell their families and their spouses and their friends that they were going to be without a job and they spent a night of wondering what their future was going to be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When people lose jobs and people are retrenched, that is almost the same as losing a family member. People have to grieve but the people of this department were not allowed to. The minister did not give them adequate support to get on with the grieving as soon as they were told what their future was. That is something which the department and the coalition government are to be condemned for&mdash;that lack of caring and compassion for people whom they are putting off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This program and people have been very good. The people have worked hard. The program has been very successful and has done good things for the bush but this government does not care and has abolished it.

<PARA>I want to pay a compliment to this particular council; I have to admit to being the Leader of the Opposition's representative on it. This is a little&hyphen;known organisation which performs a highly commendable role and actually does a great deal in fostering a better understanding of parliamentary systems within Australia and also overseas. This organisation has a number of counterparts overseas and fosters greater understanding and cooperation by the process of exchange visits. On a number of occasions you would have seen young people being shown around the building, functions being held for young people and opportunities <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for politicians to meet young people who are politically active in their own countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ten years ago I had the honour to be part of a delegation of this council to the United States to observe the 1986 mid-term elections and, more particularly, to view the gubernatorial race that was taking place in the state of Kansas and the senatorial race taking place in the state of Missouri. This was an opportunity that I relished and I have benefited from greatly. That was the time that I actually learnt and understood how the American political system works and just how different it is to the Australian political system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This visit was an opportunity to make friends with opposition members, members from the Democrats, the National Party and the Liberal Party&mdash;major political parties who send delegates. It was also an opportunity to make friends in the United States and to make contacts there. Several years later one of the people we met in Missouri came to Australia as a delegate from the United States political exchange program. It was delightful to be able to meet and greet a fellow friend, somebody we had met before. A few years after that the escort person from the United States&mdash;someone who had been our escort person when we had been in the states&mdash;came back to visit Australia. I was able to continue the relationship and the friendship with Andy when I visited and greeted him and his wife when I was in the States again last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is this sort of meeting, greeting, understanding and getting to know people at a personal level that stands international harmony and goodwill in excellent stead. It is the sort of thing that we need more of, particularly as we are seeing so much these days one of the Independent members from the other House wanting to talk about differences that people have and differences in other countries. This program shows you their differences and their culture, but also the similarities and enables you to meet these people as friends and equals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of countries involved in this program. The United States program has been going the longest. We are now building one with Japan. The Japanese were out earlier this year. We have had the German delegation <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5863"> here. Hopefully, shortly a delegation will be coming from the United Kingdom. We are also working to get delegations from Korea and a number of the South-East Asian countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, this is a very important program because it provides people with the opportunity to mix and to greet and to understand. There have been many people from both sides of this parliament who have had the opportunity to travel to the other countries that are involved in this program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This program works very closely. It is not all government funded. It is a program which also receives funding from the private sector. I think it is this mix of private and public sector involvement that also lends to it being a very vitally important program for the education and the greater understanding that parliamentarians and young political activists actually have in how politics works in other countries. It leads to a much greater understanding and important friendships and links between Australia and many overseas countries.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>This report on the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority covers a very important organisation, which looks after one of the major wonders of the world in Australia. This organisation is responsible for maintaining the reef off the coast of Queensland in its pristine condition. I know that it is very dear to the heart of Senator Reynolds, a senator who resides in North Queensland and who shares my appreciation for the reef.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sad part about this report is that the government has decided to change the structure of an environmental management charge which was previously levied by the Labor government. The charge was a nominal $1, which was devoted to research. Now we see that the government has moved away from that and is seeking to increase the charge. I believe it was recently reported that the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> charge would rise from $1 to $2 from 1 January 1997 and there would be an additional $4 charged from 1 January 1998.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This increase in the levy was seen by the government as being a compromise but, really, it is not a compromise for the tourist operators, as I understand it. It really leaves them in no better position than they were when the government first announced the increase in the levy. The tourist operators in the areas that I visited are particularly small operators and to bear any increased cost is fairly horrendous indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current proposal by the government in respect of the reef tax, as it has become known, is to see that increase phased in by 1 January 1998. If one looks at the packages that the tourist operators have out on the Great Barrier Reef, one sees that those packages have fixed prices until April 1998, some three to four months after the last $4 will apply. I believe that this has left a number of operators in that area fairly disconcerted and disillusioned with a government that had promised them earlier in the year, as part of its major election promise, that there would be no increase on taxes in the tourist industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is with regret that one sees that happening and that one sees that the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority is going to have a major role as a tax collector rather than as an overseer, a purveyor, of the maintenance of the reef in its pristine condition. I see that this is a most unfortunate thing to be happening to this great authority. I think the authority has, over a period of time, shown its commitment to the environment, shown its commitment to the management of the reef and should not be in any way distracted from its major charter, which is the preservation and the maintenance of the reef in as pristine a state as one could reasonably expect.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(7.01 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would certainly endorse the comments of the previous speaker, my colleague Senator Hogg. This tax that has been imposed is a very discriminatory tax. It is a tax that has been directed at northern tourism but not southern tourism. Earlier in this debate Senator Cooney made some very appropriate remarks about the National Gallery, but I note <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5864"> that there is not a 500 per cent surcharge on visitors to the National Gallery. Nor would I advocate that, I would like to emphasise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point is that we have a government that is treating tourist attractions in a discriminatory fashion. If it is good enough to impose a 500 per cent increase on the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, if tourists visiting the reef have to pay that impost, why would we have differential standards for the National Gallery? It gets something in the order of $24 million for its running costs. I am a great supporter of the Australian National Gallery, but it is the discrimination between different types of tourist facilities dependent on where they are located that I find unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority is world renowned. It has an outstanding reputation in its field of research. The Great Barrier Reef Wonderland and Aquarium that operates from Townsville itself has run extremely effectively for many years now. It does not get the kind of financial assistance that the National Gallery, the Australian War Memorial or the Sydney Maritime Museum get.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although Senator Ian Macdonald from North Queensland has recently been appointed as a parliamentary secretary&mdash;and it is welcome that the government has at last recognised that they need a voice from the north in cabinet&mdash;he seems to have been unable to influence Senator Hill to date in terms of amending this decision. The decision to phase in the 500 per cent increase is not the answer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question is: are we going to have a 500 per cent increase on all tourist attractions in Australia? Is that what we want? Is that reasonable? If the answer is no, it is no for the reef, it is no for the National Gallery and it is no for the War Memorial. It is not differential. It is okay for the reef, yet we have a different standard for other tourist attractions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very regretful that it seems that the government is determined to press ahead. It will make it very difficult for some of the small operators. It is something that I find totally unacceptable because it is discriminatory. I do not believe that this government <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> should be singling out the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority for differential standards in terms of the imposition of this 500 per cent increase. It is in fact a tourist tax that applies only to tourists visiting North Queensland.</PARA></SPEECH>

<STATE> (Queensland)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(7.06 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would also like to speak on the issue of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. I do not have quite the same appreciation of its work that the two previous senators who spoke had. I think they were a little over the top in their praise of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. I think there are some problems with that authority, but the Democrats certainly do not want it to be abolished.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If it can be improved and if it can be funded properly, then certainly it will play a very important role in the future. It has played an important role in the past. There is no way we want what is happening at the moment to be a way in which the government can gut the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. That thought has crossed my mind. There is no way that the inquiry, which the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) has signalled, will be allowed to be simply a way of abolishing the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority or so rendering it ineffective that it might as well be abolished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the reef tax, which is bound up with this whole issue, again, the Democrats hear the arguments put by the previous speakers. I am fairly swayed by them, but we still have one question in our mind&mdash;that is, ought not those who use the reef and those who do damage to the Great Barrier Reef also pay for its maintenance and upkeep? That is the question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem with the proposal the government has made is that they are only fixing on one user; that is, tourists. They are an easy target. There is an obvious way of collecting the tax through them. What the Democrats would like to see is all people who impact on the reef contributing towards its maintenance and upkeep.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HX5">Senator WOODLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is the dilemma exactly, Senator Hogg. That is why I am certainly tending towards the arguments you are putting in this debate. I have to say that the Democrats have not yet arrived at a final position, because we are wanting to hear the arguments on this whole debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other concern I have is that these taxes&mdash;as with many of these taxes introduced by a government, supposedly to do a particular thing&mdash;are simply another revenue raising device, rather than being a device which will raise funds to protect the reef. Again, this is one of the problems when you connect something like a reef tax to funding for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. What you are really saying to the marine park authority is, `If you increase the number of tourists and collect more reef tax, you will be better off in terms of your own revenue.' That is a real catch-22.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that kind of connection ought not be made. That device would make it too easy to interfere with the running of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and change its character from one which is given the task of protecting the reef to one which simply issues licences for more tourists. In fact, by that very device you increase the damage to the Great Barrier Reef.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what I am saying is that we have some real concerns about what the government is doing in terms of this reef tax and its intention for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority in the future. We are concerned as to whether or not it really is going to take account of those members of the coalition in North Queensland who made a lot of noise about how they were going to turn this around and what they were going to do. In fact, it is pretty easy to roll the environment minister. I was surprised that he just did not roll over, because he seems to do it&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the budget sought to do was quite similar. It sought to increase the charge to meet the increased cost of operating the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. The proposed increase was from $1 to $6. I make no bones about that fact. As a result of work that has been done&mdash;for example, by Mrs Kelly, the member for Dawson; Mr Neville, the member for Hinkler; Mr Entsch, the member for Leichhardt; and me&mdash;we went to the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) and we said, `There are some problems.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Conroy, of course, was not here when the Labor Party introduced the environmental management charge, because the Labor Party never bothered to talk to industry. Not once did the Labor Party consult with the tourism industry on anything that it did in North Queensland, because the Labor Party is full of people like Senator Conroy, who just make a decision from the blissful ignorance of Victoria or wherever they come from.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first thing we did was sit down with members from the industry. They said, `Thank <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5866"> goodness we have a government that is willing to discuss government decisions.' So that is the first thing that those on the other side of the chamber should bear in mind: that the industry accepts that this government is much better in terms of consultation than the Labor Party ever was or ever could dream of being. After all, let's face it: who would want to go to a consultation with some of the people we have on the other side? There are a few good senators on the other side. I will exempt them from that but, I tell you what, there are a lot of very poor ones on the other side as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The industry met with us. We organised a meeting in Brisbane with the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) and the minister responsible for tourism, Mr Moore. That meeting was also very successful. The industry asked for a number of things&mdash;and I do not think I am spilling the beans here. They asked for a review of the operations of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority; they asked that the charge be deferred or reduced; and they said they really believed it was important that the industry kept on talking to the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So that process of consultation continued. Most importantly, the industry identified that they were willing to live with an increase in charge, provided they could defer it so that it did not impact on forward sales that they had already made or were committed to making.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember, for example, Ed Green from Reef 2005 phoning me up one evening and saying, `Look, Bill, the industry will be happy if you take this charge to just $2.50 next year.' I said, `Ed, it's a bit of an ask, but we'll do whatever we can.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right, Senator Woodley, another tax. This tax is really going to mean a lot of people are going to be disadvantaged. A lot of people are going to be forced to lose money because this government does not want to introduce a sensible administration scheme. That will mean a huge increase in the number of complaints at the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. It has no chance&mdash;no chance whatsoever&mdash;under the current funding levels of coping with that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a steady increase. As this legislation has been used more and more by <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5867"> members of the funds, the demands on the complaints tribunal have been increasing. That is shown in the report. There will be further increases as more and more members of the funds are unfairly taxed because this government will not come to its senses and introduce the new tax via the PAYE system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is obvious to everyone but the government is that it should be levying this tax via the employer. It is a simple two-step process&mdash;the employer notifies the tax office of who is above the threshold and then the tax office advises the superannuation funds who the levy or tax should be put on. It is that simple. But the government has got itself in a real mess on this one. They cannot afford to do that. They have made this bogus promise that they were not going to increase taxes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have walked into government and have suddenly discovered that the one that applies to superannuation was not a core promise. It is one of the three out of 10 that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) talked about&mdash;the three out of 10 where people have been forced to pay extra. We support that. We do not have a problem with that. But if you are going to administer it, you have got to do it fairly. There is no point in putting a tax on everybody to slug the 300,000. That is what is going to happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Transport Workers Union fund has about 120,000 to 130,000 members, and not many of them will be up for the surcharge. But every one of them is going to be paying to find out who is. It may be only 1,000 members, but all 120,000 members are going to be affected. All of them are going to feel fairly aggrieved, and they have a right to be aggrieved. You have the situation where the complaints against funds must rise. People are going to start to ask questions about the way the funds are managed, the way that this unfair tax&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was with great sadness today that I learnt about the sudden death of Senator Liam Naughten, Chairman of the Irish Senate. Last month I was fortunate to lead a parliamentary delegation to Ireland. During our visit, we spent many enjoyable moments with Senator Naughten. The warmth of his welcome and his generous manner left an indelible impression on all delegation members.</PARA></TALK.START>

Anyone who has spent any time in the Irish parliament would know the high regard with which Senator Naughten was held. While his death is a great loss to the Irish people, it is an even greater loss to his family. I have asked the Irish Speaker to pass on the delegation's sympathies to Senator Naughten's widow, six sons and two daughters.

<TIME.STAMP>(7.22 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the successful visit to Australia, including to Canberra yesterday, by President Clinton, the President of the United States of America. Overwhelmingly, we must all be very pleased with the success of the visit. It certainly demonstrated the close friendship and relationship that Australia and America have, both at a diplomatic governmental level and, above all, at a people level.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A couple of matters, image wise, were small irritants on the side. The government mishandled the arrangements to invite a cross-section of Australian women to have a private meeting with Mrs Clinton in Sydney today. I do not think it looked good that invitations were hurriedly being reissued or issued today to such people as Senator Kernot, the Leader of the Australian Democrats. There is also the argument that, while it appeared that a balanced list was drawn up, there may have been a process whereby either the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), his wife or his office went <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> through and added people to the list and took other people off it. There has been a rather unseemly side to that, which could have been avoided. I do not think that reflected well on us in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also have to say that there are some other images about the visit that I personally thought&mdash;though others would disagree&mdash;were a bit out of date. I noticed that one article in the paper today commented on the fact that Mrs Howard and some of the spouses of government ministers wore gloves and hats, as in the 1950s. Maybe I resonate to that a bit, but others probably would not. Again, they are minor issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue I really want to raise is that of the speeches made by both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) on two public occasions yesterday. It has been reported in the press today by a number of commentators that they thought Mr Beazley's speeches were in many ways superior, had more emotion about them and were more memorable than the speeches by the Prime Minister. I got the transcript of both the speeches by Mr Beazley and the Prime Minister, Mr Howard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all acknowledge that Mr Howard is an excellent parliamentary debater. He is very good at speaking off the cuff. In jousting in parliament and in responding to interjections, he is as good as any parliamentarian. He is recognised on all sides as being an excellent parliamentary speaker. But it is clear that on occasions, such as the one we had yesterday, where he was speaking on behalf of all Australians, his reliance on being able to make a good speech off the cuff fails him and, therefore, Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not the first time that people have commented on this. As Leader of the Opposition last year, he spoke off the cuff in his televised address in reply to Mr Keating's address about the theme of Australia as a republic. It is clear that Mr Howard is missing out on a number of opportunities to present Australia in a way that people, including our guests here, such as President Clinton and Mrs Clinton, would regard as memorable. It seems to me that the Prime Minister should not rely on making speeches off the cuff on <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5869"> such occasions. He should, as Mr Beazley did yesterday, prepare a speech and speak to it. He should memorise it, if necessary. He should have a speech that has some memorable phrases and images in it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One noticed yesterday that Mr Beazley, in his speech at the luncheon, mentioned his knowledge of, and interest in, American history. He said that President Clinton was the first Democrat President elected from the south for two terms since Appomattox. He also mentioned General MacArthur in his speech to parliament in the House when welcoming Mr Clinton. He also used the occasion to reassert our interest in President Clinton's commitment to a non-racist society, et cetera. That was all done in a quite appropriate and very effective way, with people saying that they were memorable images.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In both his speeches, the President, without doubt one of the most effective personal communicators of any politician in the world today, spoke from notes, but he did it in a way that made it appear he was speaking off the cuff. He is very skilled at that. He mentioned in his speech at the lunch that Benjamin Franklin had given a special order that Captain Cook was not to be interfered with by the American navy at the time of the War of American Independence because Captain Cook was recognised as a major explorer. Again, in his own speech in the chamber, on several occasions he touched everybody by raising a level of emotion and commitment on issues that everyone would feel strongly about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me&mdash;I do not want to be accused of partisanship, although I will because I am a Labor senator&mdash;that there was nothing memorable in the Prime Minister's remarks. There was nothing memorable that would be recorded and taken down as a direct quote. There was nothing that people would say reflected the occasion. There was nothing that in several years would be remembered or recorded and replayed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I call on the Prime Minister to stop trying to make off the cuff speeches on such occasions. He should at least prepare a speech and give it great thought. With the help of staff, et cetera, he should work through it properly <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> so that it reflects well not only on him as Prime Minister but on all Australians, as he is our Prime Minister. The Prime Minister should accept the fact that, on such occasions, speaking off the cuff in a parliamentary style is not appropriate. You cannot interject on the Prime Minister at such occasions. You cannot rely on the robust nature of a parliamentary forum styled in the Westminster system to create life. In your speech, you have to create your own images and points of contact with the audience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thought both of the Prime Minister's speeches yesterday reflected his competence in welcoming somebody but did not represent the significance of the occasion. The occasion was only the third visit of an American president to Australia in our history. It is only the second occasion when an American president has addressed both houses together. It is also an occasion where a major luncheon was held, with over 600 people present. It was an occasion when the remarks made by all speakers&mdash;both Mr Howard and Mr Beazley, and the President&mdash;were recorded on television and played around Australia. Segments would certainly have been played overseas, including in America. I wonder what grab or section of the speeches that Mr Howard made people will remember.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some might say it is gratuitous advice by a member of the opposition, but I do think that Australia is not getting good value from our Prime Minister, who thinks that the best way to do this, because he is a good parliamentary debater, is to speak off the cuff on such occasions. I think he should have spent time with appropriate staff writing speeches. Remember that the great speeches of all time that we recognise&mdash;whether they are from Lincoln, Churchill or even his own political mentor, Mr Menzies&mdash;were not memorable speeches off the cuff; they worked at them.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to draw attention to the ramifications and the effect that one of the announced budget measures is now about to have. It is the one in the health budget to make cuts of $75 million to compensate for cost shifting between the states and the federal government in the sector of health care.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a recognised thing that, over the years, cost shifting from the state governments to the federal sector has occurred. Nobody denies it. It is very difficult however to quantify. That is something that we attempted to elicit during the estimates procedures. We wanted to know what procedure was undertaken to measure what was cost shifting and what were, in fact, the normal increases that would be expected to be occurring as we have an ageing population and we wanted to know the impact of an ageing population upon our health care system, which will see an increase in that happening. Certainly, at estimates we were told that the minister&mdash;and this was at the end of September or early October&mdash;had not yet determined the basis on which the adjustments to the Medicare hospital funding grants for individual states and territories would be calculated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have been told that there was some methodology to be used. The methodology to be used to derive an estimate for the cost shifting was to calculate the growth rate in services per capita in each state and Australia from 1994&hyphen;95 to 1995&hyphen;96 and to calculate a new national average growth in services per capita for 1995-96, excluding the two high growth rate states of Victoria and Western Australia. It goes on with some further calculations to be undertaken. Using the above <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> method, an amount of $75.2 million was calculated for cost shifting in 1995-96.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This week we saw the results of that exercise. As I just said, the two high growth rate states were Victoria and Western Australia. Which is the state that has copped the slug in this $75 million cut? It is the state of New South Wales. I know we are the most populous state, but we are not the state in the last 18 months that has been indulging heavily in cost shifting. In the last 18 months we have had a Labor government in that state, and that government has endeavoured to abide by the spirit of the agreements. But, for its troubles in the last 18 months, New South Wales is being cut by $34 million. That $34 million is for this financial year. This financial year is one&hyphen;quarter or more over. This means that this state is going to have to find $600,000-odd per week from its health budget to just maintain current services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know how that is possible, because $34 million equates to something like the treatment of 17,200 patients, 400 hospital beds and 900 doctors and nurses. This state cannot afford to suffer this. But what is Victoria's cut going to be? It is one of the big ones that is into cost shifting. It is going to be cut by $24 million. Queensland is going to be cut by $5 million, Western Australia is going to be cut by $9 million and Tasmania is going to be cut by $3 million. Something shonky has gone on here. We heard in evidence in estimates that the two biggest cost shifters in recent times are Victoria and Western Australia. What are they doing? It looks to me very much like New South Wales is being penalised because it is the only state that has a Labor government. The rest have all got their friends up here, as they are the same colour as the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that New South Wales was a big cost shifter when this was first highlighted in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Who was in power from 1988 to 1995 in New South Wales? It was the coalition. They are having two bob each way. They have had it in New South Wales, where they attacked the system. They ran down the system, they cost shifted and they did not abide by agreements. You get a change of government and they are <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5871"> abiding by agreements, but they are of a different political colour from who is now in Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What in fact is happening is that cost shifting. We are being penalised in New South Wales by a Liberal government for the sins of a previous Liberal government. It is not at all fair. It is not the way to be running a health system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we have asked for the calculations, we have been told that there is no real way to get information about cost shifting because allegedly nobody admits to it, and I suggest that is fairly accurate. But we know from the Senate estimates procedures that the two big cost shifters are Victoria and Western Australia. I suppose they do not want to talk about the Western Australian one too much because it is in the middle of a state election. I wonder whether Western Australia has received its letter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The letter came into effect in New South Wales at the beginning of this week. New South Wales received the letter, I understand, only late last week. The first instalment was 19 November. The first time the government heard of the precise amount of this cut was in a letter to a New South Wales health officer last Friday. There was not even the decency for it to be minister to minister; it was health officer to health officer. So the biggest state in this country has been treated rather shabbily.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have to also remember that this is just another health cut that this budget is indulging in. The government has already cut the dental health program by $36 million. We tried valiantly today to get that money back, but we were unable to. There is the $7 million efficiency cut. There is the slashing of special purpose programs, such as women's health, which has copped a $5 million cut. These are the sorts of things that have been happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot understand why Victoria has a cut that is $10 million less than New South Wales. When you are dealing with those figures, the populations of New South Wales and Victoria are not that different. When you are dealing with the fact that that is the government of the state that is now into big <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cost shifting, then you see that what has happened is pretty shonky and pretty rotten.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1995-96 the Medicare payments in New South Wales rose by 1.2 per cent. That can be attributed to the ageing of the population and not to cost shifting. Since 1995, the Labor government of that state has honoured its commitment to public hospitals and increased the funding to health by $632 million. The New South Wales Labor government share of the health budget has risen from 46 per cent to 49.7 per cent. It is now being expected to foot more of the bill. What has happened is disgraceful and shameful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no way I can see any explanation of how this formula was worked out and why, when they were working out the parts of the formula that we have seen, the methodology, they have excluded the two high growth states: Victoria and Western Australia. I could ask my colleagues here who are from those two states precisely how their Liberal coalition state governments are eroding the health systems there. We in New South Wales, with the Labor state government, do not want to go down that path; we do not want to see those sorts of things happen.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this evening to say how disappointed I was today that there was no debate on the Commonwealth dental health program and the cuts which will remove that. The cutting of funding to this program is perhaps the most short-sighted and poorly considered decision to be made by any health minister in recent years. It is a decision which is not only going to have a damaging effect on the dental health of many Australians but also ultimately going to cost this government money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5872">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There can be little doubt that the Commonwealth dental health scheme was&mdash;and we need to use that word now&mdash;cost effective and efficient. It provided a limited range of services to a tightly targeted population, and I think it has been very clear that we are not talking about a middle-class welfare.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The program is limited to health care card holders and it aims to improve their access to dental care with the long-term goal of&mdash;in the words of Kaye Roberts from the University of Adelaide&mdash;`moving patterns of care from emergency to basic, from extraction to restoration and from treatment to prevention'. This scheme was introduced by the previous government after the national health strategy found that while low income earners did not have a higher rate of dental decay than the rest of the community they were twice as likely to have all their teeth extracted and that in middle age they were five times as likely to have a tooth extracted and less likely to have received a filling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, the 1994 evaluation project for the Commonwealth dental health program showed that nearly one in 10 health card holders aged 65 years or more no longer had any natural teeth, compared with just over one in four non-card holders. The cause of this staggering difference in dental health was, according to the national health strategy, unequal access to dental care, with low income earners delaying dental treatment because of the cost and seeking dental care only as a relief from pain. The strategy found that, while in the general community 50 per cent of people received dental treatment at least once a year, public dental services were treating only 14 per cent of low income earners, and then that was mostly for pain relief.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the data which underpinned the setting up of the dental health scheme. That is what this scheme is about: getting people to the dentist before the pain becomes unbearable, before the decay goes too far and while they still have a chance of saving their teeth. But the value of the scheme extends beyond that personal level. As Mike Morgan of the Association for the Study of Community <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Dentistry wrote in a letter to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> shortly after the budget:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From recent NHMRC estimates, the long&hyphen;term cost borne by the community for the treatment of dental disease is higher than the cost of treating the effects of diseases such as heart disease, diabetes and most cancers . . . Loss of a program specifically designed to reduce dental costs and eliminate pain makes no economic sense and precious little humanitarian sense.</PARA>
<PARA>What will happen to those unemployed people who had their teeth repaired under this scheme in order to increase their job prospects, for instance, in order to look more respectable for interviews? What happens now to homeless people in Kings Cross who were treated as part of this program after a survey showed that 85 per cent of them had dental problems including decay, toothache and abscesses? What about the boarding house residents, people with mental illness and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in remote areas&mdash;all of whom received care under this program?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will tell you what is going to happen to these people.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within 12 or 18 months we will be back to the same level of crisis as we had in 1994 when this scheme was first introduced. We will be back to months or even years of waiting for basic dental care and we will be back to public dental care meaning emergency care with high numbers of extractions and very low numbers of fillings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very clear that, at the end of the day, the states and our public hospitals will not be able to cope with the demand for basic dental services following this cut. And what is more, the government, it seems to me, does not appear to be particularly concerned about what will be the likely outcome. When Senator Lees, my colleague who is responsible for this portfolio, asked the department during estimates committee hearings just how the withdrawal of around 40 per cent of public dental funds was going to contribute to the efficiency of Australia's health system and the dental health of Australians generally, this was the response:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is anticipated that the States will continue their traditional role of providing public dental services <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5873"> and will allocate their programs an appropriate funding priority.</PARA>
<PARA>It was a bit difficult to see just how the department could actually make that blithe assumption given that, at another point during the estimates, it also told the committee that it had undertaken no formal consultations with the states as to what their plans might be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact of the matter is that the Commonwealth dental health program was set up in the first place precisely because the states were not providing an adequate service for low income earners. It is a bit much to be coming in here now and arguing that that same program can be abolished simply because it is the traditional responsibility of the states to provide dental services to low income earners. That is clearly not good enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind honourable senators that they have just passed legislation authorising the Commonwealth to take back responsibility for child immunisation from the states for this very same reason: they just were not doing their job properly. Yet we have the same minister wanting to wash his hands of the responsibility for dental health and to duckshove it back onto the states without giving them any additional funds with which to cope with such a service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One further point I want to draw to the attention of senators is that, in estimates, the department made this important acknowledgment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In general terms it should be noted that the reduction in Commonwealth dental health program funding will result in less emphasis being applied to strategies which focus on increasing access by special groups&mdash;as there will be reduced resources for caring for these clients.</PARA>
<PARA>The special groups to which the department is referring are homeless young people, people with intellectual disabilities, Aboriginal people, the survivors of torture and people living in remote areas. By the department's own admission, that is who will be most hurt by the decision to end this funding. That is why the Democrats were requesting the House to reverse this decision and that is why we would like to see every single coalition <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> backbencher stand up and be counted on this particular funding cut.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With so much at stake, it is not good enough for the government to hide behind the excuse that there was a budget black hole which, somehow, had to be filled. If that is the argument which coalition senators and members want to use, then perhaps they can also offer their constituents an explanation as to why the government can find $500 million to spend on private health rebates, most of which will go straight back into the pockets of the private health funds, but, at the same time, it cannot find $130 million to ensure that disadvantaged Australians do not live in pain, do not have to wait 12 months or more to see a dentist and do not lose their teeth because they cannot get decent dental care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The impact of this bill on dental health will be instant and it will be destructive. There is no alternative. The states will not pick it up&mdash;we all know that. Had there been debate today, I would have implored the government to look at this measure again. If there is any single item in this budget package, the appropriation bills, that should have been reconsidered, it is this. The Commonwealth dental health program ought to have been supported in this house and in the other house and I think we owe it to a great many Australians to now explain why it is that Australia cannot afford this program.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

I did not stay for the adjournment tonight to gnash teeth <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5874"> about the matters that were contained in the budget.

That really is not the right way to do things on matters as important as the cuts to programs that Senator Allison has mentioned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My task tonight is to add to the words of the President of the Senate just after question time and to the words of Senator John Watson earlier tonight in this adjournment debate to express some sympathies to the colleagues and family of Senator Liam Naughten, the Chairman of the Senate of the Republic of Ireland. Senator Naughten died in a car accident on 16 November aged 52, the same age as me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was not so long ago&mdash;indeed, over 12 months ago&mdash;that Senator Liam Naughten sat alongside the then President of the Senate in this very chamber when he visited our country as the leader of the parliamentary delegation from the Republic of Ireland. I had occasion to meet him, as did many of my Senate and House of Representatives colleagues. I found him to be a particularly warm human being, a very relaxed individual, which was surprising when one found out that he and his wife, Mary, had eight children between them. As a father of three, I found it amazing that someone could keep their humour and personality with that number of offspring to look after, particularly as some had passed their teenage years and some were approaching. But he was a wonderful human being, and I was shocked when I heard the news of his all too early demise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been able to obtain a copy of the obituary that appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Times</EMPHASIS> from the Internet, which is relayed into this building. I want to quote from part of that obituary. Liam Naughten was unique in many respects in that he served in both houses of the Irish parliament. He first went into the Senate, which has a different method of electing <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> senators than we have this country. Sometimes it is easier and sometimes for some it is even more difficult to get a seat in the Senate. He served in the Senate and was later elected to the lower house, the Dail, the House of Representatives over there. The obituary reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He lost his Dail seat in 1989 in a bitter battle that became legend. He and John Connor, his Fine Gael running mate, were neck&hyphen;and&hyphen;neck for the last place in the three&hyphen;seat constituency. The votes were counted and recounted for three days. The whole county waited for the news.</PARA>
<PARA>This is two colleagues from the same political party battling for the seat. The obituary continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Naughten lost the seat by one vote.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But, in keeping with Naughten's gentle but resilient personality, the two men did not remain enemies for long. He was known for his friendship across the political divides and was close to John Bruton, the current and present Taoiseach. He was loved for his warmth and modesty by the people from all walks of life. He listened carefully and understood everybody's point of view.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He was re&hyphen;elected to the Seanad in 1989 by county councils around Ireland. He sat on the agriculture panel and became deputy chairman of the body almost immediately. He took over the chairmanship last year following the death of Sean Fallon, his friend and neighbour from Fianna Fail, the other side of Irish politics.</PARA>
<PARA>There are many sides in Irish politics, like there are here. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">His election as cathaoirleach was a unanimous one.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">His greatest political moment came in November 1995 when President Clinton visited Ireland. Naughten formally thanked the President for addressing both Houses of the Oireachtas or Irish Parliament. It was a moment in Irish history that, understandably, made the Roscommon farmer very proud.</PARA>
<PARA>I am sure it made his wife, Mary, and his six sons and two daughters proud to see him in that very noble position and in undertaking the task of welcoming President Clinton to Ireland and to the Irish parliament.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5875">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He will be sadly missed by his wife, Mary, who accompanied him to Australia on the delegation lastyear. Indeed, he will be sadly missed by his colleagues in the Irish Senate and in the whole of the Irish parliament. There is a notice of motion on the books, as the President referred to in her contribution to the chamber after question time. Hopefully, on Monday when this Senate resumes it will be carried unanimously. Our sympathies can then be conveyed to the parliament of the Republic of Ireland and onto Senator Liam Naughten's family.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>
