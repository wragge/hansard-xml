<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill seeks to ensure that the Australian National Flag cannot be changed unless the people of Australia have been consulted and a majority of those voting indicate their support for a different design.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government believes that the people of Australia are entitled to be consulted about their nation's <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> symbols. Nowhere is this more important than with the Australian National Flag&mdash;our oldest and most important national symbol.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our National Flag has a history which goes back to 1901 when its design was selected after a public competition which attracted over 30,000 entries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The existing National Flag is declared in section 3 of the Flags Act 1953 and its design is reproduced in a schedule to the act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, when the Flags Bill was introduced in 1953 it received enthusiastic bi&hyphen;partisan support. I trust that this bill, which gives legislative expression to the commonly held view that any change to the Flag is a matter for the Australian people, will receive equally enthusiastic support from all sides of the House.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I now turn to the details of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill does not seek to override the right of Parliament to legislate. Any new flag which might be chosen would become law by the action of Parliament. What this bill does say in subsection 3(2) is that the current National Flag shall only cease to be the Australian National Flag if a new flag is submitted in each state and territory to the electors qualified to vote for the election of members of the House of Representatives and is approved by a majority of all the electors voting.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subsection 3(3) of the bill requires Parliament to prescribe the manner in which a proposal for any alternative design or designs for a new Australian National Flag should be submitted to the electors, the manner in which the vote is to be taken, and the arrangements that might need to be put in place if an alternative design is ever selected as a new National Flag.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The key intent of this legislation is to reflect the principle that the Australian National Flag belongs to the Australian people; and that the Australian people have the right to be consulted in any proposal to change the Flag. Of course, at any vote retaining the existing National Flag would be one of the options.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, this bill provides the Parliament with the means to give to the people of Australia, a guarantee that they will decide if the National Flag, their National Flag, should be changed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a flag which was chosen by Australians, it is the flag the people of Australia have been united under since federation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has been the symbol of our nationhood and our community for five generations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the only flag flown over a whole continent. It symbolises our history, our geography and our system of government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the flag Australian men and women have served so well under in times of war. It is the flag <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> under which we have claimed sporting glory. It is the flag under which this very Parliament meets&hyphen;it flies above this very chamber as a reminder of the sovereignty of the people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are committed to recognising that sovereignty by giving the Australian people the right to decide the future of their National Flag.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the adjournment last night, Senator Cook was concluding his remarks on the running sheet at item 16, which is his amendments 71 to 73. He had put the very strong case on why we want to keep syndication as part of the R&amp;D process in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite all the government rhetoric that this is a rorted system and is being abused, they have yet to provide evidence of examples where someone has got through the net and run a rorted syndication arrangement. We even had theoretical examples, rather than an actual case, earlier in the debate a few weeks ago. The government has not yet proven that to us or to the Australian people&mdash;or, above all else, to that very important segment of the Australian business community that is committed to R&amp;D and is properly using syndication to make Australia more innovative and to produce value added products.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7482">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We therefore strongly urge the Senate to support Senator Cook's amendments to keep syndication as a way of providing the funds to develop R&amp;D in Australia in the private sector. If we do not have these procedures, we will actually reduce our ability to become a more innovative, more clever country.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(9.06 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commend Senator Cook's outstanding defence and his contribution throughout the estimates hearings on syndication. My own belief is that the government behaved badly, quite frankly, in pursuing this question of syndication rorts in the manner they did. Either there was a case to prove or there was not. In our mind, both in the parliamentary and public forums, they have not proven it and we had real misgivings about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the government did correctly pursue the issue of whether syndication is the most cost effective and appropriate mechanism. As you know from our minority report, we have some misgivings about that case. But we have decided on balance to support the government's view, and that is based on two conditions which we believe they have met. The first is a medium&hyphen;term commitment to START over a number of years and the second is the introduction of an amendment to prevent unfair retrospective conditions on the syndication.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Accordingly, I regret, despite the honesty, integrity and decency of Senator Cook in this matter, to say that we will not be supporting the ALP.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am just going to get some official advice on one of the matters that was raised by Senator Harradine. In the meantime, I note the comments which have been made. Senator Schacht, this issue has been canvassed extensively. I am surprised that none of the evidence managed to convince you. It clearly has not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Murray, I note your comments about the nature of the debate. Senator Murray has raised some concerns with us. As Senator Murray confirmed, we have moved to provide the assurances that he was seeking. We welcome his support on this particular matter. I shall now be responding to Senator Harradine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In relation to the matters Senator Harradine raised, the transitional provisions proposed by Senator Cook would allow up to 120 syndicates lodged prior to the government's announcement to be considered at a cost, I am advised, of over $1 billion to the revenue. On this basis, the funding for the START program will not proceed. A number of these syndicates mentioned above have already applied under the START program. We have looked in a sensitive manner at some of the concerns which were raised before the committee. I think the government has moved to address those concerns. Again, I urge the chamber to support the government's position.</PARA></SPEECH>

We are disappointed with the Democrats' position. We think Senator Harradine has tried <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7483"> to flesh out some figures here about these conflicting arguments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, you have just said that if our amendment were carried there would be 120 eligible. I think you have to make it clear. One hundred and twenty may well have been lodged, but no-one is suggesting that all 120 would be eligible. We understand they have already been winnowed down to 46. Is that true? So let us get the basis right. If there are still 120 in, you know as well as I do that the 120 have to go through an appropriate process and not all of them would be successful. That is the way the system operates. You have yet to prove one example where someone has got through that has been a rort.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA>These amendments ensure that all the applications that were in the pipeline before 23 July can be dealt with and are not retrospectively knocked out. This is not to say they will all be granted. We fully support the requirement that they have to go through a very tough, transparent process to see whether they are eligible to meet the rules. But we believe people who applied&mdash;lodged their applications&mdash;up until 23 July should have the right to have the matter heard under the existing rules.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am surprised, because the Liberal government has always campaigned on the issue in its policy. One of the few principles it seems to argue is that it is totally opposed to retrospectivity. There is a strong element of retrospectivity when people lodge their application before 23 July and then get knocked over by the rules being changed. To use good old Aussie rules vernacular or metaphor, this is shifting the goalposts from one end of the ground round to the wing, or to the half forward flank, while the match is still in play. We do not believe that is fair, especially in the area of encouraging R&amp;D in Australia. This amendment is about removing that aspect of retrospectivity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to point out to the Senate that last year on 9 August, the now Deputy Prime Minister of Australia, Tim Fischer, wrote to a constituent when we were considering these issues. His reply was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I carefully note the fundamentals involved with this important matter and I have to say that I am totally opposed to legislating retrospective detriments. My <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> endeavours, deliberations and representations will continue on this matter in line with the aforementioned position.</PARA>
<PARA>Tim Fischer made it pretty clear what he thought about any element of retrospectivity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the examples&mdash;I think this may have already been drawn to the attention of Senator Harradine&mdash;that will be knocked out if we do not get this amendment carried is an R&amp;D project to apply to Gold Mines of Australia at the Mount Lyell mine in Tasmania. That is an R&amp;D project of $14.9 million over a three-year period, leading to developing leaching techniques for extracting copper and copper sulfide ores. If that were successful, that would be a major boost to employment and economic development on the west coast of Tasmania&mdash;an area that we all know has got economic problems as far as employment opportunities for its people are concerned. These are the sorts of proposals this government is knocking over.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> We have not heard any evidence that this particular application is a rort. One would have thought that something that encourages the economic development of the west coast of Tasmania would be a reasonably sound proposition. The technology may not develop; they may not be successful. It is not the point of the R&amp;D program to try to predict beforehand in absolute terms whether it will be successful. It is to encourage people to get into the R&amp;D so that there is a chance this new technology will help the economic development of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> It is still not clear how many of the applicants will get through with the successful carriage of government amendment No. 15. The government is making a number of accusations that we want up to 120 applicants to go through. We would like the minister to give us an indication&mdash;for the public record&mdash;as to what the amendment does. The real reason we have proposed our amendments is that we do not think the Senate ought to support a proposal that knocks people out who apply before 23 July under one set of rules&mdash;that would retrospectively knock them out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Liberal Party have always argued very strongly that they are against the issue of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7485"> retrospectivity. In this case, we are not talking about the bottom of the harbour scheme&mdash;which got the former Liberal Treasurer and now Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in a fair bit of strife with some Liberal senators many years ago. We are talking about an R&amp;D program. The government has not shown any evidence that this is a bottom of the harbour scheme at all. Therefore, the retrospectivity element should not be proceeded with.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We stand by the amendment which we have moved. We have put in place appropriate transitional arrangements for syndicate applications. In reference to a couple of the matters you have raised, given the structure of syndication, it is worth recording that approximately $1.4 billion would be buying approximately $450 million worth of R&amp;D. In anyone's terms, that is not value for money. I would urge the Labor Party to reconsider its position. You asked what is the effect of our amendment. My advice is that 16 syndicates are likely to progress, and they will have a value in the order of $160 million.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the matter you raised regarding the advanced bacterial leaching R&amp;D project and the application involving Gold Mines of Australia, I can provide you with the advice that this applicant applied in March 1996 for advanced rulings under the new finance scheme guidelines. The application has not been considered by the IR&amp;D Board and the applicant has no advance approvals. The application was not included in the promoter's A list but does appear on the TRA list, the disaffected syndicate applicants. The applicant has not submitted a request for syndicate registration but has applied for a grant under the R&amp;D START program.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA>I do not know whether this bill is aptly described as the gravedigger's bill, but that is the phrase that has got into the lexicon around this place. We believe that the government amendments have not gone far enough. We note that the government has picked up the recommendation of government senators on the committee report which allowed for applications to be allowed from those with a history of applying&mdash;I understand that is two or more applications&mdash;and those companies with a tax loss which could not apply at the moment for the 150 per cent. The government has taken those on from the committee; and we believe that is a step forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We announced on 6 December a measure as part of our innovation statement to chop out what is called gravedigging. We believe that was an appropriate decision to stop this <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7488"> process. However, we believe that those claims that have been lodged with the department since then should be dealt with. We do not think you should arbitrarily knock them out. Maybe the minister could enlighten us on how many of those claims there are at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has also been some confusion about whether a claim lodged has also been registered at the same time. I am not certain about the situation just because a claim has not been registered. But if it has been lodged and if it has been receipted that it has been received in the Department of Industry, Science and Tourism, to us that means it has been received and it ought to be dealt with under the guidelines laid down on 6 December.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that our amendment means that those who, in good faith, have lodged their application after 6 December, when we announced the new guidelines, should have their day with the department, knowing full well that there are strict guidelines and that a number of them probably will not succeed. We believe that to just knock them all out holus&hyphen;bolus, other than the two categories the government has accepted from its own senators, is still unfair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that all applications that have been lodged should get their day with the department to see whether they are eligible or not. To just, by legislation, knock them out after they have already complied with rules laid down again has an element of retrospectivity which we do not believe, in this case, is fair.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA>The aim of these amendments is to get around the retrospectivity of the government's proposal with regard to compensation settlements. We are concerned that the new arrangements would mean that a compensation settlement made to people between the ages of 16 and 18 after 1 July 1995 would be taken into account after the passage of this bill in calculating the youth training allowance. It would mean a reduction in that allowance or potentially the removal of that allowance because of the past compensation payment.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is going to catch people out. It is going to mean that people who have budgeted on the youth training allowance, taking into account a compensation payment that has been made in the last couple of years, are suddenly going to find their budget does not matter. The government is going to reduce the training allowance according to a new formula and it is going to put people in extreme circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had a debate here last night about retrospectivity. There was a strong feeling in this chamber that retrospectivity was not fair when it applied to people who had interests in mining. I do not think it is fair when it applies to young people who are living close to the breadline and who are dependent upon a budget that they have made out according to existing rules. We should not be allowing retrospectivity in this matter. Therefore, we have moved to do away with the government's proposal that the legislation be retrospective to 1 July 1995.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact of the matter is that the government is proposing to introduce a youth allowance from January 1998. Effectively, that proposal would merge all forms of income support for young people. The proposal is that it be means tested on parents' income and that it cover young people who are aged between 16 and 20 years of age and students up to the age of 25.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has given commitments that it will consult on this proposal, and we accept that that is a proper course of action. It certainly requires a very significant degree of consultation because this proposal has very far-reaching implications for young people on their incentives to train and look for work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This particular budget measure is one that received considerable scrutiny during our committee inquiry on the bill. In the opposition's minority report we pointed out that rather than prematurely legislate to bring social security payments to young people into line with Austudy it would be far more appropriate for these measures to be considered in the context of a broad community consultation process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have indicated our concerns now for a long time that abolishing the minimum rate of YTA and cutting off under 18&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds from payments on the basis of the parents' income really does open the door for this being the same situation for young people up to the age of 25 years. We think this measure is very premature.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I indicated, I made some remarks during my speech on the second reading and I would be interested to hear what the minister has to say about the consultation process and about this pre&hyphen;emptive strike on young Australians, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> particularly&mdash;and this is a very important consideration for the committee&mdash;when we have the situation we do in this country in relation to youth unemployment and the unwillingness of the government and the responsible minister to set targets in this area.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move the Democrat amendment No. 1 in the sense that we will be opposing schedule No. 3. This schedule will abolish the minimum payment of $65.75 a fortnight for young people who receive the youth training allowance, the payment for young people or sickness allowance. The government says that this is in line with attempts to establish a common payments structure and there is currently no minimum payment available through Austudy. I point out that as a result of this change 1,800 young people will receive a reduced rate of payment while 3,900 young people will lose their payment entirely.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats agree with the need to push for a common youth payment. As a matter of fact, I can go back to 1984 when I was part of a group of consultants to all of the major churches in Australia and we produced a document called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">It's a Rocky Road</EMPHASIS>. In that, we argued for a common youth payment. So I have been living with this idea for quite a long time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I say to the minister is that although we agree with that push for a common youth payment, we do not believe this should be undertaken simply by reducing the various payments to their lowest common denominator. I point out that despite the good news about unemployment yesterday&mdash;and it was good news to see a drop in the rate&mdash;the unemployment rate for young people still stands at 29 per cent. I know the government is not happy with that, but at the same time I want to say to the government that we really do not think that this reduction should happen while consultation is still being undertaken for this common youth payment. For that reason, the Democrats will oppose schedule 3.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true, as Senator Faulkner says, that we have been engaged in a substan <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7494"> tial consultation process around the country on the common youth allowance. I think it is fair to say that there has been little or no dissenting voice on the need for a common youth payment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not just a common youth payment that people are concerned about; there is wide concern about the disincentives to young people that are currently perceived to be in the system in terms of whether they go into education or become unemployed. I think all of us in this chamber would be wanting to see encouragement of young people into education rather than any financial disincentive for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation with the common youth allowance proposal is that any change from that would not be implemented for some time and it would be unduly restrictive to suggest that no change should be made in any of these areas pending resolution of the wider reform directions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue of whether payment to under 18&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds should be parentally income tested is not in question in the consultations. The change is consistent with the directions indicated in the youth allowance proposals, that is, to align payment conditions for students and the unemployed and to avoid disincentive to entering full&hyphen;time studies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as whether it would lead to hardship for families is concerned&mdash;which, I believe, is behind the concerns expressed in the chamber this morning&mdash;it will affect only those families with income and assets above the parental income assets limits and only imposes the same limits as for Austudy. After all, if we are taking a decision to move to a common youth payment, it is surely appropriate that the same means test be applied to the 16&hyphen; and 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds for both Austudy and youth training allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the current arrangements and the proposed labour market assistance reforms, young people are eligible for priority assistance regardless of their income support status and specific programs or measures to improve school to work transition will also address that issue. So the concerns which senators may have on that score, I think, should be put to rest as well.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Woodley talked about the number of clients who would be affected by the proposal and I think it is important to recognise what the financial situation is for families. Currently, the minimum rate of $65.75 a fortnight is reached when parental assets exceed $393,750 and when parental income equals $30,435 per annum. Under this initiative, a nil rate of payment will be reached when parental income equals $37,273 per annum or parental assets exceed $393,750. As I have said already, the people who are disqualified from payment due to the initiative will still retain their entitlement to labour market support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This measure is, as Senator Woodley points out, consistent with the common youth allowance and it is just not realistic to provide a minimum payment to all young people. The cost is very great. I am not aware of any key concerns in the consultations over the youth allowance with this particular measure and I would suggest to the Senate that their youth allowance should be no excuse for inaction now.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry but I take issue with that. The issue is one of how much. I am not going to accept that these measures are simply for the good of the young or disabled people of Australia or whoever the measure is targeted at. We know, and the minister herself has repeatedly said in the Senate, that cuts by the government were necessary because of the $8 billion or $10 billion black hole, accept it or not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a fiscal imperative. It is important for the committee to know what the government believes it is going to achieve by taking money out of the pockets of young people, as in this situation, by removing the minimal payment that they can get of $62.50 a week, and allowing some people to go to nil payments and others to go to smaller amounts <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7496"> than $62.50, which is not going to give them the independence they have under the current circumstances. It would help the committee during the next few hours if we could have a calculation on each of these items as to how much the government thinks the measures will save. It is an important part of the committee's ability to come to a decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister might take umbrage over this but the government is going to be working and has been working on saving money. Whichever way you look at it, saving money by the government in situations like this means taking money off potential recipients. The committee ought to have a clear answer. Last time we were told it was a minimal amount. I would have liked to have known what the minimal amount was that was being saved by the last measure. I do not think we can proceed just by knowing it is a big, small or medium sized amount. I would like to know the numbers.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I well understand the value for the committee in knowing the savings on measures. I would point out that a number of measures proposed in the legislation cannot be said to be savings measures. The emphasis has very much been on trying to achieve simplicity in a very complex system, on treating people in like situations in the same way. This happens to be one of those measures which is treating people in like situations in the same way. We will come to others as we progress through the bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did mention earlier some of the figures as to the level of assets and income of the families we are talking about. There are not substantial massive savings in this measure because it is directed particularly at people on those higher income and asset levels who are currently ineligible for the Austudy assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will just take you through the cost of this amendment. The 1996&hyphen;97 savings are estimated to be $3.7 million. The following year they are estimated to be $8.2 million; the following year, $8.5 million, and the following year, $8.7 million. That should reassure you that this is not going to mean a massive effect on <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people across the board. It is very much targeted to making sure that the families who have substantial assets and reasonable incomes are all treated in the same way. They currently do not get that entitlement under Austudy and they would not get it under this proposal for the youth training allowance. I do not believe it is unreasonable. It is certainly not designed to be a massive producer of savings. Nevertheless, it is a worthwhile measure in terms of treating people in like situations in a like way. To me that is rational and fair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It certainly is one step along the way to the common youth allowance which, as I have said, the consultations have demonstrated people very keenly endorse. I have had conversations with a number of organisations, as well as the formal consultative process by the department, and this is the direction in which people believe we should be moving&mdash;to have all youngsters treated in a similar way.</PARA></SPEECH>

They have similar expenses that all young people have, but we are talking about young people here who are still of an age where they are being cared for by their families.

<PARA>This is obviously one of the most complex and, let us be frank, contentious schedules. I think there will be a considerable amount of debate around all parts of the schedule. I would like to make a couple of general points. I do not want to waste the time of the committee, because this is something that I have canvassed in the second reading debate and on many other occasions in the public arena.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to make it absolutely clear at the outset of the debate on schedule 5 that the opposition does support tough measures with regard to fraud and compliance, although, of course, we do not believe people should be cut off from benefits without good reason. We do not believe people should be cut off from benefits for an inordinate or indefinite period of time. It is for these reasons that we have, in a general sense, some very serious concerns about measures contained within this <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7499"> schedule. It is for that reason that we are proposing amendments to address them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I can say that we genuinely believe that the proposed activity test regime is one that is excessively harsh. It is unreasonable&mdash;particularly in the absence of any measures from the government to assist unemployed people returning to the work force. We really believe that many aspects of this proposal are unworkable. We believe they will very unfairly penalise genuine job seekers, honest job seekers. We do not believe, as the government seems to, that it is the intention of nearly everyone on unemployment benefits to defraud or rort the social security system. We believe the vast majority of those people are genuinely looking for work and warrant the support of government in the difficult circumstances they find themselves in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part 1 of schedule 5 of the social security bill tightens up the use of employer contact certificates. We believe that it is unreasonable to require completed employer contact certificates to be provided with an initial claim for unemployment payments. Our amendments ensure that the employer contact certificates can continue to be utilised, but not until a person is actually receiving a payment. I commend the opposition's amendment to part 1 of schedule 5 to the committee.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Greens oppose the employment contact certificates. I draw the committee's attention to the fact that our amendment that is coming next would get rid of this pretty iniquitous system. The employment contact certificates are a means whereby people when they go to employers&mdash;this is selected people&mdash;have to get that employer to fill in a certificate to say they have been, they have applied, they have made contact but they have not got the job.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem with it is that it not only annoys the people who have to get the certificates filled in but also annoys employers right round the country. It is a particular impost on small businesses. There is no requirement for the employer to fill in the certificate. So the young person&mdash;or the old person for that matter&mdash;or whoever it is who is unemployed can go to an employer, can go to a series of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> employers, to get these certificates filled out to show that she or he has been there, only to have the employers refuse to fill them in.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="PANIZZA" NAMEID="JI4">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JI4">Senator Panizza</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is better than the present system, though.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QD4">Senator BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the present system is bad enough. It should be revoked as well. The problem is that some employers will find themselves with a queue at the door, with a big lot of certificates to fill out. Other employers might be amenable to this, but some will simply say no. So through no fault of their own, the hardship falls on the people who are trying to find a job.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no research to show that these certificates help people find work. There is plenty of anecdotal evidence to show that it is quite the reverse. It becomes an impediment to people finding work. The employers get upset because they have to fill in these certificates. They are sick of being a statistical piece of evidence for the government, and they simply get their back up. It provides an obstacle to the person who is applying for the job: the employer is annoyed at the outset if the person appears with a certificate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is worse is that the certificate brands the person who is coming up for a job. The employers know that these people are, in some way or other, under special surveillance by the government. So they say, `Hello. Here is somebody with a certificate. I have to watch out here. This person has not been too good at finding a job. I will short cut the whole process of giving a fair interview and giving them a fair go and show them the door. If I feel it is a bad day, I am not going to fill in these certificates.' So they would have wasted their morning, blighted their hopes a bit more, demoralised them a bit more and sent them back to try to explain to the employment office how come they haven't got a certificate filled in. It is a really nasty little system and it is very unfair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now the government wants to allow this system to be put onto anybody who comes through the door. Until now, there has at least been some check on it whereby people had to be, in the view of the secretary at least, not doing too well in getting a job. The department might have thought they were not being <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7500"> assiduous enough in finding a job and said, `Get some certificates filled out so that we know you have been to the employers.' Now that is no longer required. So there will be persons who can be, and will be, I think, inevitably, punished on appearance&mdash;on how they look, on how they walk through the door&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me go a little further while I am on my feet. We were discussing here last night the rebates given to companies involved in research and development. What we discovered is that those rebates, to the tune of some $3.5 billion a year, come without government assessment. So the government is handing over $3.5 billion without a requirement for assessment to the rich, to the corporate sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But when it comes to kids going to get a job it says, `Get a certificate filled out. We want accountability for you that we do not apply to the people getting research and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> development funds.' Just a while ago&mdash;and I must not reflect on a vote&mdash;the committee disagreed with a move from the Greens to at least have some basic accountability about how much the corporations are getting in terms of their cut out of that $1.2 billion a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the diesel fuel rebate&mdash;$753 million this year. Some corporations like BHP are getting $100 million. Where is the accountability there? It is simply a cheque given to these corporations on request. It can be checked on, but it does not have to be up front. We have not seen that legislation in here. So there is an amount of some billions of dollars being given to the corporate sector that does not require the  certification that is being used on these people down on their luck in our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are double standards of the worst sort. It is not just a case of having to appear dressed the way that Senator Panizza might want people to be when they come through the door to assess whether or not they are going to get the requirement for employment contact certificates foisted on them in a discriminatory fashion. Every one of those folk know that there are big corporations that are not required to provide such evidence of their bona fides when they put out their hand for a multi-million dollar tax rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an unfairness that reeks. The Greens are totally opposed to it. Let us have a bit of fair handedness here. This employment certificate scheme is wrong, is punitive and actually gets in the way of many people getting work. I would like to ask the minister what evidence she has that it works. How much does it cost to administer this scheme? How much does it cost employers around the country who are diverted from their otherwise productive works to either fill out these certificates or decide they will make it harder for jobseekers by refusing to fill them out?</PARA></SPEECH>

<STATE> (Queensland)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(10.58 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to go back to the previous question that is on the running  sheet. I think we are going to deal with Senator Brown's amendments separately. I would like to indicate that the Democrats' amendments 2 and 3 are identical to the Labor Party's <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7501"> amendments 2 and 3. So, clearly, I am not going to press mine but I support the Labor Party's amendments. I certainly do not want to hold up the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just let me make some brief comments. These amendments deal with part 1 of the bill and they will clarify some of the provisions relating to employer contact certificates. If you can fix up employer contact certificates, we would like to try to do that&mdash;at least make them a little less severe. That is why we have moved this amendment ourselves and now support the Labor Party amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have great concerns over the use of employer contact certificates just in principle. But we will not be opposing this path as it does have some beneficial aspects to its operation. We are concerned, however, that if employer contact certificates must be used, then they should only be issued to people whom the department has good reason to believe may not be undertaking sufficient job search. As such, we believe it would be inappropriate to impose these requirements on a person who has simply lodged a claim for newstart. The amendments, therefore, simply remove the words `or has lodged a claim for' from this part 1.</PARA></SPEECH>

<STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(11.00 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a number of issues here. I have a brief story from when I was in Carnarvon, Western Australia, which is an area where there are times of the year when there are few jobs and times of the year when there are jobs picking and so on, with not a lot of other choice in other parts of town. However, young people go to growers and say `Have you got a job available?' One grower said, `Look, I get sick of them coming and asking me. I have told them if they come and ask me I will charge them $5 a time.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That, obviously, is not allowed, but it is an indication that there are people who do refuse because it is annoying, and that was even under the existing scheme which is not as onerous as what the government is suggesting now. Basically, it gives you an idea of what the feeling is in the community and in a community where there is this definite gap. There might be seasonal employment at some time of the year and very little at other times <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the year, and the continuous requirement to get these statistics will get up everybody's nose in the end. I do think it is counterproductive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know whether that kind of response&mdash;asking for $5 to sign it&mdash;is out of the ordinary, but I know that it happens. I know that there are many areas in Australia, because of various issues to do with pulling out training and capacity to benefit, where the cumulative effect will be ghettos of unemployment and ghettos of non&hyphen;assistance from government. It will be made worse by what appear to be requirements to fill out forms in a certain way which may, in fact, in some areas of Australia, be impossible to fill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember asking questions in estimates in relation to some of these changes. I asked a public servant whether or not he could foresee a time when we would have mini&hyphen;Brixtons throughout Australia. The public servant replied, `Senator, I understand what you are saying, but that was during a time in Britain of great social turmoil.' Well, yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, basically, here we are creating a worse situation. We are blaming the young person&mdash;this is part of what is happening&mdash;by saying obviously it is their fault they are not employed.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are using statistics and bureaucracy to justify draconian situations, just like Senator Newman came in here not too long ago with statistics showing how many people the government had thrown off benefits. It would be really interesting to know exactly how many of those people were thrown off on technicalities&mdash;for not filling out their form right or getting it in an hour late or a day late or for various reasons&mdash;just so that the government could get some good statistics which showed that, say, $15 million was saved in some particular program&mdash;$15 million worth of suffering. I think that is the kind of thing we are being asked to support in the government's proposals.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have listened to what has been said. I, too, believe that the amendment put forward by Senator Faulkner and Senator Woodley should be accepted.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is presumptive and pre-emptive of the department to extend this to those who have applied for newstart. I think that you are going to find also that a number of people will just fall between the two stools. In other words, a number of people who are initially quite timid and diffident about going out looking for jobs may well be picked up by the department when the application is made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those people can be trained, but why should they have to wait? It is assumed, I imagine, Minister, that they will not be getting the newstart allowance until they have satisfied the department as to the number of ECCs that they have got.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think there are some misconceptions in the comments that have already been made. Therefore, while recognising that there does not seem to be support on the face of it for these proposals, I would like to put on the record that in fact there is a beneficial part of the proposals which seems to have been overlooked.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The employment contact certificates are currently issued to some newstart and youth training allowees to provide evidence that they have applied for work. The certificates have to be signed by an employer who has advertised a job vacancy. If a person does not return them completed and has no reasonable excuse, they may not be paid for two weeks or more. That is the current situation. That means that a person who does not comply with the requirement and who does not satisfy the activity test is therefore subject to a non-payment penalty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The provision seems to operate irrespective of whether people have made reasonable efforts to apply for advertised work but, for one reason or another, cannot get an interview to have the ECC completed. Our amendments will remove the ambiguity in the existing <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> legislation to ensure that the ECC provisions do not disadvantage or result in penalties for genuine job seekers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That problem has been highlighted by other senators and our proposals will go some way towards addressing it. Although the government believes that people who are not genuine about looking for work should be penalised, it does not consider that such penalties should be imposed where there are legitimate reasons for not being able to meet the administrative requirements and the person is otherwise genuinely meeting those requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of other matters have been raised, particularly by Senator Brown, which it might be more appropriate to deal with when his item comes before us. Perhaps some senators are not aware that the department already has the administrative ability&mdash;not exercised constantly but available to be exercised&mdash;where a person appears to have had an unsatisfactory work record in the past, to require an employer contact certificate to be obtained by the person applying for benefits. That is administratively in place now; that happens when it is deemed necessary. We propose to enshrine that ability in the legislation. That is the sort of circumstance in which this provision would be used.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, both the Australian Democrats' and the opposition's amendments restrict the department in an area where you would expect the department to be vigilant about somebody who has had an unsatisfactory work record in the past. The department has a duty, at the same time supporting those who are in need, to protect the revenue. I would see this provision as a proper exercise of that responsibility; that where they are aware of somebody's unsatisfactory work record, they would require this ECC to be obtained if it is reasonable in the circumstances to obtain it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The department can do that now, administratively. We are asking the Senate to endorse that ability through the legislative process. I would urge honourable senators to reconsider what I think is a not unreasonable proposal.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Those are the matters I was referring to when I said earlier that I was proposing to address certain matters when we came to Senator Brown's amendment. I am happy to address them now, if it helps.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know whether I can provide Senator Brown with the figures he is asking for at the moment. Already I have been advised that there is a minimal administrative cost with the ECCs because they are issued and returned with the regular fortnightly forms. The scheme works to allow job seekers to confirm their job search efforts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for the employers, I understand that representatives from leading employer organisations have stated publicly that they do not believe that the changes will result in a considerable burden to employers. The secretary to my department has written to major employer organisations detailing the changes to the activity test and requesting their support for the measure.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, I point out that the employer contact units, set up, firstly, in Tasmania and now in operation around the rest of the country, are bringing in thousands of calls from employers who find it an easy, low cost way to deal with the department on a range of issues. Some might be formal matters, others just inquiries, while others alert the department about people you could call `work shy'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Employers' needs and the cost of doing business with government were very much taken into account in the introduction of those employer contact units. The employer contact certificates are not used indiscriminately. They are used particularly where people are seen to be at risk of not pursuing job opportunities. That is not the only situation. Over the years statistics have found certain people, particularly young people, are a vulnerable part of the community, and where such groups are identified the certificates will be introduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know whether I have the information Senator Brown requested. I have not mentioned the problem of employers refusing to sign; I can say that our amendment addresses that problem. The current legislation provides that allowances be cancelled if people cannot get certificates completed. Our changes allow that, provided people attempt to get them signed, they would not be penalised. Those are the sorts of reasons I believe it is appropriate to pass the government's proposals.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the number of people, we do not have reliable statistics&mdash;I give that proviso&mdash;but we believe that it is in the order of 50,000 people a year currently affected by these certificates.

We are in a country where there are far fewer job vacancies than there are unemployed people, and I think those unemployed people have really drawn a short straw.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, can the minister remedy this situation?

<PARA>The amendment from the Greens is to do away with these employment contact certificate schemes. I will not go into this at length, but I just reiterate that we believe they punish people unnecessarily, they are a great administrative burden both on the government and on small business and they lead to people who have difficulty finding a job being confronted by angry employers who do not want to waste their time filling out certificates. It is then up to the person to go back to the employment office and explain why she or he did not get a certificate filled it. It demoralises people. It is an impediment to people getting jobs, and the money could be much better spent on initiatives directly aimed at creating jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point that I made earlier, and I just reiterate, is that, in a way, this is a forced self-assessment scheme on people who do not have jobs, but the government does not insist on the same sort of assessment for people getting millions of dollars in tax rebates&mdash;mining corporations, other big corporations involved in the self-assessment to get research and development returns. The unemployed people have to get the assessment, if you like, from a prospective employer they do not know and may never see again and who can just make life difficult for them because it is annoying the employer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we oppose this system. I think Senator Margetts gave an extremely good example of how it is readily abused and can cause great heartache to people unnecessarily. The money should be spent elsewhere.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Apparently we cannot see the regulations that are going to determine how this works, which is a dereliction in terms of the committee having to make a determination on whether it agrees with the application of these new rules. It is a pretty complicated system. I have sifted out a couple of things. Firstly, people who go for a job for which they are not skilled have the onus on them to negotiate with the employer that they will be skilled on the job. In some vague way, we are supposed to accept that the employer is going to get reimbursed for that training.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Secondly, a person who goes for a job and sees that the job is not safe with work conditions that are not acceptable has to negotiate with the employer about fixing up those work conditions, otherwise she or he is likely to go back and have their benefits cut off. It is up to this person who is going for a job not only to shoulder the burden of approaching an employer&mdash;which is a fair job for many people seeking work, and for youngsters in particular&mdash;but also to negotiate that they are going to get training and take back a report saying, `It didn't work. The employer did or didn't agree to give me training.' Also, if they spot that the workplace is not safe, they are going to have to negotiate and come back with a report as to whether the employer was agreeable to fixing up the unsafe conditions. The threat on job applicants is that they will lose their benefits if they have not entered those negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we do not know the guidelines. We do not know the exact parameters which govern whether or not they have done the job properly. I submit that is totally unsatisfactory. The Greens oppose this measure, because we do not believe that added burden should be put on the shoulders of job seekers. It is hard enough as it is. It does depend on the whim of the employer saying, `Yes, I will skill you' <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> or `No, I won't skill you' as to whether they get a job, or saying, `Yes, I will fix up the workplace' or `No, I won't fix up the workplace' as to whether they get a job. I think that is extraordinary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Maybe the government ought to move in and say, `You fix up your workplace.'

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First of all, it is not to be regulations, Senator Brown. The normal arrangements for social security legislation in this type of area traditionally&mdash;and we are doing nothing different&mdash;is to bring in guidelines when the legislation is completed.

Perhaps if you know otherwise, you should tell me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other matter that Senator Brown raised is this question of negotiation. It is not negotiation. That is why I was shaking my head at you. It is not expected that a job seeker will be negotiating. This is not developing a workplace agreement or any form of industrial activity. This is simply that we expect the employee to ask a question, `Will I be trained?' and to get an answer, yes or no. On the basis of which: if it is yes, they are expected to take the job; if it is no, they are expected to inform the department of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Similarly, if you are talking about occupational health and safety conditions, an employee has to say, `I believe this might endanger my health and my safety. Are you prepared to fix it up to conform to whatever might be the law? Are you prepared to improve the situation so that I could accept a job here?' If the answer is no, then the department will look at that and the discretion will be exercised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what we are asking. We are not talking about negotiation. I think it is very important that that be hit on the head. I have heard other senators, some time ago, assume that that was the arrangement. Let me put it clearly on the record that they are going for a job interview and if a situation arises where questions of training or of occupational health and safety are asked, such as, `Will you fix it?' or `Will you give me training?' and the answer is no, they then go back to Social Security and report that fact.</PARA></SPEECH>

How will the government make sure that the employer comes good on that commitment, and what will be the quality of that commitment? Of course there will have to be negotiation. The whole exercise becomes facile otherwise. It becomes absurd.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, if a person goes to a clearly unsafe workplace and says, `I'm here to get a job, but this is unsafe. Will you fix it?' and the employer says yes, they then lose their benefits if they do not take that job. I would submit that, if there is an unsafe workplace, the employer must be under a great cloud of suspicion to start off with and is the least likely person to fix up that place. But on the glib answer of yes, a person's fortunes as to benefits depend. That is not satisfactory. It is not conscionable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You are going to deprive job seekers of any income on the words yes or no coming from an employer, regardless of that employer's bona fides. That is not satisfactory. We have to remember in this place that we are dealing with people's lives and fortunes and their ability to make ends meet. We will have a litany of tragedies&mdash;as far as people's lives are concerned&mdash;coming to public notice further down the line if this circumstance is allowed to come into law, which is what we are talking about here.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If people have concerns about what an employer is doing or about how fair dinkum they are in providing training or making a place safe, the obligation ought to be on the authority that will take away the job seeker's money if they do not accept the employer's word. That ought to be your authority and your responsibility, Minister. I think this is just totally unfair.

That is the point. You have now got a situation whereby all jobs, or the conditions other than the basic minima prescribed in the act, will be negotiated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, the government says, `We want you to negotiate with the employer in terms of an AWA, or whatever'. The difficulty with this is that it is all about negotiation. That is the problem. In order to actually attain a position, the government has encouraged job seekers to sit down and negotiate what the conditions would be in that position, other than the seven prescribed minima. Therefore, for example, training is a negotiable matter in terms of the contract that is finally hammered out between the employer and the employee.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will move first to the question of savings that Senator Faulkner asked me about, because he is in the chamber. The following information was provided by the department in response to questions by the opposition in the legislation committee about calculation of savings from the activity test measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Savings arising from the changes to penalty periods were calculated separately, as were changes to the definition of an activity test breach. Savings for each of the other measures identified as part of the activity test <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7521"> package were not calculated separately because of the interaction between the measures. They were costed as a package on the basis of their expected impact in terms of extra breaches, increased incidence of successful job search and increased voluntary compliance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the Department of Social Security and the Department of Finance have estimated their contribution to savings from the legislative measures other than the changes to the penalty periods as follows: in 1996-97, $1.4 million; 1997-98, $2.1 million; 1998-99, $2.1 million; and 1999-2000, $2.1 million.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that spirit it might be possible that, when we move to voting on a range of measures which obviously are of interest to senators, we consider holding divisions over until the conclusion of the committee stage of the bill.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with you, Mr Chairman, and thank you for the suggestion of how to deal with it. I would like to briefly address the remaining issues of concern to the opposition in schedule 5. That is a sensible way to contain our debate at this stage. The opposition has concern with both part 3 and part 5 of that schedule.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part 3 of the schedule extends the penalties for breaches of the activity test to six weeks for the first breach and 13 for the second and subsequent breaches. The activity test regime that Labor introduced when it was in government was a tough one. But, as I indicated very clearly in my speech on the second reading and as was the thrust of my second reading amendment, it was a reciprocal one. It was developed under an arrangement of a reciprocal obligation, where the community undertook to pay income support for those actively seeking work and to provide labour <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> market assistance in employment services which unemployed people need to get back into the work force. In turn, unemployed people were obliged to meet the conditions of the activity test. Penalties were further tightened under the Working Nation job compact, where people were given greater access, variety and training and were guaranteed at least some work experience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The key issue here is that this government has abandoned the concept of a job compact. It has abandoned the concept of reciprocal obligation. It is in those circumstances that we say that this regime is too harsh. That is why we are proposing amendments to limit breach penalties to the equivalent of just over four weeks non&hyphen;payment for a first breach and just over six weeks non&hyphen;payment for a second or any subsequent breach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the opposition's part, we acknowledge and accept the very strong case that has been put to us by welfare groups and community organisations arguing that all penalties should be imposed in the form of rate reduction rather than in the form of non&hyphen;payment. The amendments that we have before the committee reflect that suggestion. We will be moving amendments which ensure that all breaches&mdash;be they activity test breaches or administrative breaches&mdash;are served by way of a reduction in the rate of payment rather than the alternative non&hyphen;payment period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition propose that payments be reduced by 16 per cent, which is slightly higher than the current withholding rate of 14 per cent. Under this regime, people's payments would be reduced for 26 weeks for a first breach, which is a very long reminder to any individual, and by 39 weeks for a second or any subsequent breach, an even longer reminder. The beauty of this regime is that the capacity for significant savings remains for the government, but it does not cause the same level of hardship on unemployed people in the community. That is of fundamental importance as far as the Labor Party is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part 3 also introduces a period of rate reduction instead of non&hyphen;payment periods for administrative breaches. We support this measure in principle, as I have indicated <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7525"> before. But we believe that the proposed rate reduction of 25 per cent is too harsh. We have proposed a regime of 16 per cent reduction for 13 weeks rather than a 25 per cent reduction for eight weeks. The same principle applies to those current administrative breaches destined to become activity test breaches under part 4 of schedule 5.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind the chamber that we received very compelling evidence from welfare groups, such as the Welfare Rights Network and ACOSS, that people serving long breach penalty periods were really left with very little option in terms of their survival. The options that were presented to us were pretty simple and very stark: beg, borrow or steal. In that spirit the opposition proposes the amendments that stand in our name. By no means and never will we be willing to be placed in a position of accepting any rorting or fraud in the social security system. The Labor Party can honestly say we have a very strong record in government in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part 5 of schedule 5 extends the non&hyphen;payment period for moving to an area of lower employment prospects from 12 weeks to 26 weeks. We believe that this is an extremely harsh measure on the part of this government. An extremely unfair measure is being proposed. It really does not take account of the whole range of reasons why an unemployed person may seek to move home. We certainly seek to omit that part from the schedule.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to the government, again, that they went to the election indicating that they would protect the poor, the needy and the vulnerable in our community. We have heard the government say that since the election time and again. At the end of the day, when you are bringing legislation before the parliament that is about ripping the guts out of the social security safety net&mdash;over $1&half; billion in this bill alone&mdash;the colours of the government are really nailed to the mast.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yes, we believe in tight, proper fraud control and compliance measures. We are very fair dinkum about that. We will not tolerate rorting of the social security system. We want to see fair measures in place.

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HX5">Senator WOODLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it was. However, let me address on the running sheet item No. 9, and then the others which may be involved, by speaking to schedule 5 part 3&mdash;Green amendments 10 to 52 and ALP amendments 14 to 54. I will give comprehensive attention to those so that I will not need to continually interrupt the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are dealing with the activity test and penalty periods. This part of the bill makes a number of changes to both the length and the means of imposing penalty periods on unemployed people who breach their activity test or do not meet the administrative requirements of their payment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Looking firstly at activity test breaches: the bill will change the penalty period for such breaches to six weeks for a first breach and to 13 weeks for any subsequent breaches. Currently, the penalty for a first breach is between two and six weeks and subsequent breaches attract a penalty of the previous breach period plus six weeks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The system of penalties proposed in this bill does have the advantage of placing an upper limit of 13 weeks on the length of any single penalty period, whereas at present there is no upper limit. As most people only breach once, however, the proposal has the disadvantage that it will increase the average penalty period unemployed people are faced with from 3.7 weeks to 6.8 weeks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Welfare Rights Centre pointed out at the community affairs inquiry, a six&hyphen;week penalty equates to a loss of nearly $1,200 income for the unemployed person and a 13&hyphen;week penalty equates to the loss of just over $2,500 for subsequent breaches. Welfare Rights also pointed out that these losses are far greater than the fines imposed for offences <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7526"> such as common assault, assault causing bodily harm, stealing from a person, malicious destruction of property and driving under the influence of alcohol.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People who have such a penalty imposed on them will be thrown into total financial chaos. They will not be able to maintain stable accommodation, they will not be able to keep a car in good running order and will not even be able to meet basic living costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am reminded of the debate we had a couple of days ago in which one of the welfare agencies&mdash;probably the most significant one in emergency relief&mdash;the Salvation Army, pointed out that they could not see how, even with an additional $24 million, they would be able to meet the cost of $1.8 billion being slashed from the social security budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since then of course the voice of the Reverend Tim Costello, the Treasurer's brother, has been added to that voice and he has underlined the fact that welfare agencies will simply be unable to meet the effect of what we will do here today if we agree to the government's proposal. So I think we need to underline that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ironically and counterproductively, the effect of that financial chaos will be to severely impair their ability&mdash;that is, the people who are the objects of these penalty periods&mdash;to continue to look for work. Surely that is not the government's intention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats simply cannot support allowing the Department of Social Security&mdash;the department charged with the responsibility of alleviating poverty, I would have thought&mdash;to throw so many people into abject poverty. We will be supporting the Green and ALP amendments which will soften these penalties for activity test breaches.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning now to the changes to the administrative breaches, the bill seeks to replace the system of total payment withdrawal for administrative breaches with a system of partial payment withdrawal. In other words, rather than lose their payment entirely for two weeks, the person will have a 25 per cent reduction in their payment for eight weeks. The Democrats support this change and I <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> think we could give the government a tick for introducing it. We believe such a system is also appropriate for activity test breaches and note that the ALP and Green amendments will establish that.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The minister says she didn't, so she can get up and say `no' to that. The Greens' amendments are a bit more on the side of the people who fall foul of these laws than are the other amendments before the committee. If you look at young people who may be paying $100 a week rent, who <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7527"> are on social security payments but who are found in breach, our 14 per cent deduction in their income would leave them with about $10.70 a day, the Labor Party's 16 per cent would leave them with about $10.25 a day and the government's 25 per cent garnisheeing of their income would leave them with $8 a day. We are getting down to pretty tough stuff.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask the government to look at this again. I do not know how many members opposite have found themselves without a quid in their pocket&mdash;not just for one day, not just for one week but for six months. You are asking people to start to look at taking some pretty desperate measures. You have got to the point where it is counterproductive. We think that the cost on society is going to be far greater than the savings you think you are going to make out of this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us remember in particular that all these measures are being impelled by the government's own budgetary philosophy. That is where they are coming from. They are not coming from a readjustment for the good of the unemployed or the luckless in our society. It is wrong. You have gone too far.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that the committee will amend these pretty draconian measures being taken against people who are in desperate need of an income, whatever else. Maybe it is a punishment mode that is creeping into this line of social security delivery for defaulters. If it is, the minister ought to think again because it will be counterproductive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why the Greens oppose the government's tack. That is why the Greens have brought forward amendments which are going to leave people with at least some income to make ends meet and not cut them off altogether or not cut so deeply into that income of $8 a day from which they have to feed themselves, clothe themselves, take transport and do all the things that all the rest of us&mdash;or at least those of us in this place&mdash;simply take for granted.</PARA></SPEECH>

I do welcome Senator Woodley's support for the administrative breach reforms. I think it is a step in the right direction. I urge the chamber to support those reforms. </PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Brown is revisiting a debate that we had the other day. I thought I had made it quite clear in the Senate&mdash;I am sorry that he did not recognise this&mdash;that I was poorly reported on the issue of welfare agencies and that the government was making additional payments available to welfare agencies as a recognition of the existing problems they are having trying to support people in poverty and in difficult situations. Our extra funding is independent of anything to do with this legislation. There is not a connection between this legislation and then providing money to the welfare organisations. It is a recognition of the need that they are in now. A reassessment of the formula, which is overdue, has been promised as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The savings in this measure are very substantially to come from voluntary compliance. Senator Brown has perhaps ignored the fact that we are talking here about the activity test breaching and not the administrative breaches which I just referred to with Senator Woodley. We are talking about the activity test breaching. We are talking about people who deliberately breach the provisions of the legislation. The community does expect the law to be upheld, whatever kind of law it is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I can talk now about the ALP and the Greens' amendments on the activity test breach penalties, because there are significant policy and technical difficulties with the proposed amendments. As we have advised the opposition, continuing breaching of the activity test by the unemployed is more than a payment issue. It gets to the broad and the essential qualifications on issues. It is as central as whether someone is still really unemployed and whether they are qualified for any payment. Because if they are employed and they are not declaring their earnings, they are clearly in breach and cannot start to be eligible.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Do you want me to speed up or not? A very large proportion of activity breaches last year came as a result of breaches of labour market programs. Senator Faulkner was talking about the reciprocal arrangements that were in place between the unemployed person and the society. Those reciprocal arrangements still remain. Whether it is labour market programs as under the previous government or whether it is the reforms to the labour market programs which are coming in with the new government, case management and commitment to activity testing under the new regime will still continue. People will still be expected&mdash;in return for the right to access unemployment benefits&mdash;to commit themselves to maintaining the requirements of the Social Security Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> But the ALP and the Greens' amendments could lead to the situation where an unemployed person chose to take a 16 per cent ongoing cut in payment. Contrary to the second reading amendment from Senator Faulkner yesterday, the amendments demonstrate that they are not serious about the tight activity testing. The rhetoric is there but the follow&hyphen;through is not because&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a fact. You consider it, Senator. Your proposal of 16 per cent would allow unemployed people to lie on the beach and not undertake any job search in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> return for a small loss of payment. In other words, if people are prepared to take a lower standard of living, 16 per cent lower, they could continue to access unemployment benefits at the expense of their neighbours&mdash;indefinitely, one presumes, because they would not be in breach. Some unemployed people&mdash;I am not suggesting by any means the majority&mdash;may assess this to be reasonable if they do not need to meet any job search requirements. I think the people outside the chamber and the people in the gallery now who are the people paying for the social security system would find abhorrent the prospect of unemployed people being able to reduce their work efforts and still have their income support from the taxpayer.</PARA></TALK.START>

Those are very serious matters which your amendments do not cover. I have urged your office to give consideration to the fact that your amendments have technical flaws.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We cannot support those deficient amendments. They would remove penalties for some <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7529"> very clear breaches which I think all of us in this chamber would regard as serious breaches. There would be unforeseen consequences as a result of your amendments which I do not think you would endorse if you really thought about it.

They would allow people who willingly and continually disregard the activity test to continue on payment even though they do not meet the basic requirement of looking for work to get any payment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I would hope that Senator Faulkner would take me at my word on this and would be prepared to withdraw his amendments. If he is prepared to do that, I am willing to offer an alternative to the committee which may be agreeable to all parties. I foreshadow that I would move an option which would provide for a rate reduction for a first breach of activity test and the second and subsequent breach would still be seen as the most serious breach of all. As Senator Brown said earlier&mdash;it might have been Senator Woodley&mdash;not as many people would move on to a second and subsequent breach. Certainly, people who are repeat breaches of the law should be given more serious treatment by the law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We would propose that, for a first activity breach, there should be a 20 per cent rate reduction over 25 weeks. That equates to a full reduction of five weeks. For the second and subsequent breach there should be eight weeks of non-payment. I urge the committee to listen seriously to that proposal. I recognise that there is concern around the chamber about people being off all benefits entirely, and I recognised that by changing the payment arrangements for administrative breaches to be a rate reduction. I am concerned, however, that the amendments as they have arrived in the committee from the opposition will mean that there are a whole lot of quite serious breaches which will get through to the keeper which most of us would not endorse at all.

I have accepted Senator Newman's advice about the technical difficulties. I did it by way of an interjection which was acknowledged by the minister when she made that clear previously. As far as I am concerned, the opposition would ensure that if there were such technical difficulties we would deal with any legislation in very short order through the parliamentary processes and that would fix the technical problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Unfortunately, Senator Newman's contribution is all wrapped up in the same sort of rhetoric as we are starting to get very used to hearing from her.

Here is back&hyphen;door penalisation for people who would stand up for their rights on a matter of conscience or even get involved in industrial action which is in pursuit of a matter of very clear importance to the union or workplace in which they are involved.</PARA></TALK.START>

They lose their jobs as a result, whether they are at the centre of this action or swept up in it, and a six&hyphen;week penalty no&hyphen;income clause is being inserted by the Democrats or the government, whichever one you look at. It is wrong. Where is the court of appeal on this? There is none. A $1,000 penalty on&hyphen;the&hyphen;spot fine because you got involved in industrial action! I think it is pretty tough. I think the Democrats should think again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The appeal for them to think again about the industrial relations legislation, when it was here with its draconian secondary boycott provisions and substrike provisions, which will leave many people in the Australian workplace subject to summary loss of wages <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> even if they engage in a work to rules campaign over a matter of high principle to them and conscience, is now being backed up by this piece of proposed legislation, which means people who are caught in a strike, involved in a strike or motivating a strike on a matter of importance to them and who will lose their job as a result will suddenly have nowhere to go and no income to get.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">`It does not matter what their circumstances are,' say the Democrats and government. Six weeks with nothing. We are talking about breadwinners here. We are talking about people who will not have money in the bank. We are not talking about silvertails; we are talking about people who are living in very tough circumstances and who have just gone through the roller coaster of industrial action over a matter which is important to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that the Democrats should think again. It does not fit in with what we have heard of Democrat social policy. It is not socially just. I would add to that that many people who get involved in industrial action and lose their jobs as a result do not know that this penalty is waiting for them as well. They will then find out, if this clause gets through, that due to Democrat and coalition legislation, they have a summary $1,000 fine waiting for them in terms of a six&hyphen;week wait until they can get some social security.</PARA>

Further, we are concerned that the replacement of an annual leave waiting period with an income maintenance period will increase rather than reduce the complexity of the administration of the social security system. For those reasons, Labor will be seeking to amend that schedule.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our proposed amendments ensure that there would be no retrospectivity; in other words, they will ensure that the measure applies to leave accrued only after 20 August. The proposed amendments also ensure that the income maintenance period is served at the same time as the liquid assets test rather than being consecutive, as is the case now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to the income maintenance period, the opposition's proposed amendments do three things. Firstly, they cap it at 13 weeks. It is currently uncapped, as I understand it. Secondly, they count money paid for leave accrued only after 20 August, which relates to the retrospectivity issue I spoke about. Thirdly, they ensure that the income maintenance waiting period and liquid assets waiting period can be served concurrently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7533"> For the liquid assets waiting period, our proposed amendments restore the minimum reserve amounts to their current levels. The government is proposing that these reserves be cut in half, which would force people to run down their savings even more. The proposed amendments substitute the fixed dollar amount in the divisor with reference to average weekly earnings. This establishes the principle that people should use up their resources at the rate of average weekly earn ings, as I think occurs with compensation, as an example.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">ALP proposed amendments 72 to 79 restore the liquid assets limits to $10,000 and $5,000 and replace the liquid assets devisor with average weekly earnings. As I have indicated, we do not want to see people left without payment for inordinate or indefinite periods of time. We do not believe that it is fair for people to be forced to run down their savings.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can really make the opposition's case very quickly indeed. We are proposing to omit these schedules from the bill. They are open and shut cases of a breach of an election commitment on the part of the government. In relation to the proposal to restore the earnings credit scheme, the coalition said in their pre&hyphen;election policy: `The earnings credit scheme will be retained by a coalition government.' This is nothing more or less than a direct broken coalition promise. It is a betrayal of the Australian people and the electorate. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> In no way will the Labor Party countenance such an open and shut case of a breach of election commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same is the case in relation to the employment and education entry payments. The coalition's pre&hyphen;election social security policy stated that to assist people to make the transition from being unemployed to work or education, the coalition `will maintain the current employment and education entry payments'. This is absolutely and bare&hyphen;facedly a broken promise on the part of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have indicated absolutely clearly that this is something that we will not tolerate.

It is a measly $100 to help them with their transition back into work when they find it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are considerable costs with getting into work, as we all know, if you are going to be able to do it well.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I saw Senator Brown going in the opposite direction as Senator Faulkner spoke, so other senators can have the answer that I have been supplied with by the officials. Currently there is no upper age limit on access to the widow and partner allowance. This is to allow people on these payments to continue receiving payment until they qualify <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7538"> for age pension, at age pension age or later, on residence grounds. This also allows for the widow allowance or partner allowance to be granted to people over age pension age. There is nothing to indicate that this was specifically intended when these allowances were established.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The measures proposed in the bill currently before the parliament will allow those already receiving these allowances, when they reach age pension age, to transfer to age pension whether or not they meet age pension residency requirements. This will simplify arrangements for older people, and I would have thought we would all endorse that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that the widow allowance and partner allowance are non-activity tested payments made instead of newstart allowance to recognise the labour market disadvantages of these groups, there is no rationale for granting them after age pension age.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to address some issues raised in schedule 10 and 11, and I will do that concurrently and as briefly as possible. As I think perhaps most senators would now realise, one of the issues in relation to the earnings credit scheme has been its low take-up rate by the people. Although there are nearly four million customers potentially who could access the scheme, only about three per <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7539"> cent of those actually accessed the earnings credit scheme over a year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is despite the constant endeavours of the department over quite a long period of notification to people on unemployment benefits of the availability of the scheme and what it could mean to them. I say `constant' because they get quarterly newsletters from the department which spell out their entitlement and encourage them to take up the opportunities that are available to them. It has been extremely complex for the department to administer but, more importantly perhaps, it is very complicated for people who are entitled to actually understand what they may be entitled to&mdash;even having been told about it. Then only three per cent actually bother to take it up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has sought as far as possible to maintain the spirit of our commitment to protect the more vulnerable. Customers who access the earnings credit scheme are by definition receiving income above the income test free areas. Abolishing the scheme therefore does not affect the most vulnerable customers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The aim of the scheme is important too. The aim was: to provide an incentive for customers to supplement their social security benefits by undertaking work wherever it was possible. Our research has shown that there is a limited understanding, as I have said. Moreover, the additional incentive to take up work is no longer considered necessary&mdash;and this is, to me, one of the most telling arguments of all. In the middle of last year, the previous government introduced new income test arrangements for allowees which included the removal of the 100 per cent withdrawal rate, the abolition of the joint income test and the introduction of a partner income test&mdash;which already provide a significant incentive for allowees to take up work opportunities. People who tell you that there is not an incentive in the system are in fact referring to what it was before July last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The existing pension income test has a higher free area than allowances and more relaxed arrangements, meaning that customers are better off working, even without access to any earnings credit. So that now applies to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> both pensioners and those on allowances. The earnings credit scheme advantages those who have a one&hyphen;off employment or investment windfall but it provides no ongoing benefit to those with longer&hyphen;term employment. I would urge you to consider that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, I would urge you to consider the importance of the measure in financial terms because it is very costly to administer, as I said. The savings in this area would be: $20.6 million in the first year and $75.8 million, $79.5 and $83 million in subsequent years&mdash;making a total of $258.9 million. So although it is a small number of people who have accessed it it has cost us a great deal to administer, out of all proportion, I would suggest, to the benefits which the scheme has produced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the employment entry payment and the education entry payment, we have been very careful to make sure that sole parents, who have been the main ones to access the education entry payment, have that right preserved. So pensioners are in fact still able to access the education entry payment, but the employment entry payment and the education entry payment for people on allowances are being removed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things which senators are perhaps not alert to is the fact that recipients will continue to also have access to the advance facility to assist them to meet any up&hyphen;front or employment costs&mdash;that is the loans scheme. In total terms, it is more beneficial than the employment and education entry payment. Under the advance scheme, they can get more money than they could under this scheme which is proposed to be abolished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, there are provisions for funding through  DEET under Senator Vanstone's proposals for access to employment to help people take up employment. In both departments there are still opportunities for people to access assistance to take up employment. The savings on the employment entry payment over four years will be $59.4 million and $7.2 million on the education entry payment. So we are talking about substantial contributions to the government's budget task, and I would urge senators to take that into account when they consider these motions.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first is the artificially low impairment ratings, which are, without doubt, designed to get as many people as possible off the disability support pension.

Our amendments also recognise the fact that disability impairment tables are intended to measure a person's work related abilities.

They also reinstate the tables dealing with musculoskeletal and ear, nose and throat problems.</PARA>

Consequences of the impairment tables were not advantageous to people applying for support under the tables and they needed revision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result, the tables were achieved by careful study by a committee of medical experts in the field of rehabilitation medicine and disabilities. That committee reported to the previous government and the table was neither accepted nor rejected. They just had not got on to doing something about it. When we came into government it was clearly an item that needed to be progressed. It was the normal course of government administration rather than any ideological effort or trying to get disability support people off pensions, as <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> I think one of the senators suggested.

They have proved to be virtually impossible to assess properly at such short notice. We could have very unintended consequences, which I do not think anybody in this chamber wants. Certainly, the people with disabilities that we are all most concerned about would be the ones who would suffer from those unintended consequences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to recommend to the committee that we perhaps take a course of action taken by the Labor government in 1986 when Senator Gietzelt was the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and a similar situation arose.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There was concern then, as there is now, about the impact of something on some of the most vulnerable people, people that we would not want to hurt. As a result, Senator Gietzelt gave an undertaking to the Senate that he would set up a monitoring committee of veterans' organisations and&mdash;I think&mdash;medical people and report back to the Senate on how the first year or so of the new guide worked in practice. I suggest to the chamber today that that would be a good model for us to follow.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would be very, very reluctant to see either the Democrats or the opposition's amendments go through today, because the advice I have had is that we really could make great <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7542"> difficulties for people with disabilities. We just do not know yet what they might be but they could be quite serious. I am very happy and prepared to give a similar undertaking to the chamber to that given by Senator Gietzelt. I would set up a monitoring committee, composed of organisations related to disabled people and also those involved in rehabilitation medicine, to analyse the impairment tables as proposed in the legislation before us. I would undertake to have the government give immediate consideration to a report produced by such a monitoring committee. I would suggest that it would require at least 18 months of analysis of how the tables had worked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I would also suggest to the chamber that we could agree to a sunset clause so that the matter would have to be reconsidered at the end of two years. By that stage we would have the report of the monitoring committee. We would know whether it worked well and whether it should be re&hyphen;endorsed or whether it needed more attention. I would rather go down that route than potentially endanger some of the most disabled people in our country. I would be grateful if I could get an indication from other senators about whether they would be prepared to support that.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that, as a result of these new impairment tables, people will either lose or not qualify for a disability support pension. There are a couple of areas of particular concern. Some impairments which previously attracted a five or 10 rating now attract a nil rating. The instructions about how the tables are to be used also are of concern&mdash;in other words, whether or not a particular disability can be counted under two or more tables. Let me be clear on this. I accept that these are difficult issues and it is important to acknowledge that they are also issues that are generating a lot of concern in the community.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know the reaction that other senators have received, but certainly my office has received a lot of calls on this issue, even as late as nearly midnight last night.

People really are worried about this schedule.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats' amendments ameliorate these concerns to some extent.

I wonder, Senator Newman, whether a more sensible approach&mdash;if the alternative before us is either the Democrat amendments with possibly a range of unforeseen consequences, and I stress `possibly', or, alternatively, putting these impairment tables in place with the certain knowledge that some of the consequences are very unpalatable&mdash;is to withdraw schedule 13 and undertake to consult with others around the chamber on the details of the tables before they are re&hyphen;presented to the parliament. And the Senate could acknowledge that it would be reasonable for you to do that quickly and put forward amending legislation in the early part of the next session. That would be a third approach that I think would be a more precautionary approach than the one that you are suggesting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hear what you say about the proposed Democrat amendments. I say to the Democrats and Senator Brown, who has a close interest in this issue and has canvassed it already in this debate, that it is difficult in a very constrained committee debate like this to be able to make these sorts of judgments on the run. I do not immediately jump to the conclusion that what the minister is saying to the committee is necessarily correct&mdash;not at all. I merely acknowledge that she indicates there are concerns in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this circumstance neither of the two options&mdash;one going with impairment tables with possible unforeseen consequences or, secondly, adopting a model of putting new impairment tables in place, which we know <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will have negative consequences&mdash;attract me greatly, I must say, Minister. So, in the spirit of providing suggestions on this particular schedule, which seems to be the way we have conducted the debate on schedule 13, that is a proposal that I would put on the table.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is our preference, of course, to go with the tables and the amendments that we have put. We feel we have spent a good deal of time talking with disability advocacy groups and we have explored these amendments thoroughly with those groups. I would like to know what degree of consultation the government had before amending the tables in the way that they have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have to say that I believe there is no greater risk. In fact, the aim of these amendments was to substantially reduce the risk, as you put it, to people who are on a disability support pension. It is your bill which proposes to take 34,000 people off the disability support pension. Our amendments will certainly go nowhere near that in risking the disability support pension to those with a disability. So I support Senator Faulkner's suggestion that we maintain the status quo and then go through a process whereby we can look at perhaps the government's amendments and our own to see what the impact of those will be on those with a disability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also be interested to hear from the minister&mdash;I know she indicates there has been insufficient time to look at the Democrats' amendments&mdash;what group of people would be more at risk from our amendments than from the government's own changes to the impairment tables. I think we need to hear that. But if there is doubt, my suggestion would be that we return to the current arrangement. There should then be a period of review so that there is time for those advocacy groups and various other people who are interested in this subject to thoroughly explore the matter, to identify those who are rorting the system and to identify those who really ought to be on newstart. But so far we have seen no evidence from the government that there is a so-called saving to be made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I would argue that there is not anything particularly outrageous or risky in the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7544"> Democrats' amendments. As I say again, we have had a thorough working through of this document with those groups. They are much less harsh than the government's proposals and they take into account multiple impairments. That is one of the key features of our amendments. For instance, they allow a rating of 10 per cent or 10 per cent to be added where there are two minor impairments. We feel this is very important in looking at the ability of a person to work as a whole person and not just as someone with a particular disability or set of disabilities. We are talking here about ability to enter the work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I would again say that the chamber should reject the government's proposals in this respect. I would be very happy to stay with the status quo and to refer this matter to perhaps a committee that can have a more thorough look both at our amendments and at the government's.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For time's sake, could I help to bring this issue to a close by saying that I will support the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Faulkner).

I have received myself very few representations and the same with the department.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I also clear up something else: I think it was Senator Allison who said that 34,000 people were affected by the tables. That is not true. It is only 2,000 people. The higher figure refers to medical reviews of former invalid pensioners; in other words, people who have not been medically reviewed for a number of years and who may not longer be eligible for a payment on medical grounds. So it is not as substantial as Senator Allison thought, if that was causing suspicion as to what the government was doing by introducing these impairment tables.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said at the beginning it was not designed as a savings measure, it was a natural progression of the work that was under way by the previous government when there was a change of government. I would prefer that, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> rather than endangering tables&mdash;which have had at least two years in the working up by medical people working with the department and consulting themselves&mdash;we leave the existing ones intact and have the opportunity for further consultation with all the parties in the Senate so that we do not introduce something with unforeseen consequences.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On amendment 14, the Greens are concerned that the government move limits the payment of child disability allowance in that it cuts the ability to claim on that allowance from 12 months to three months before a claim is made. I did speak with the minister about this when she gave us the opportunity of discussing the whole panoply of amendments a week or two ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem is that people who find themselves with a disabled child very often do not get around to making the claim for assistance. Under existing circumstances, they can make a claim up to 12 months retrospectively to catch up. They have been very busy looking after a disabled child. They may have been to and from hospital. They may have had home help. They may have been arranging a whole range of supports for themselves and for that child. The whole family may be involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are very often the exact circumstances which lead to people to think last of how to get some monetary support. With this measure, the government is saying, `Look, if you weren't watching, if you didn't know this support was available when your problems began 12 months ago, too bad. You can only claim back three months.' It is not a good way to go. The Greens do not support it. It is not going to alter the fact that a disabled child has been getting costly aid through their parents or carers. That cost is not going to disappear simply because we make an amendment here in this committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This really is a case of chopping a very important and valid benefit. No-one could dispute this benefit. It is a case of cutting that benefit to help meet the budget imperative of the government. This is not a case of trying to catch people who are doing the wrong thing. This is a case of trying to take away a benefit from people because they simply did not apply for it at the right time. They were <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> distracted by the life circumstance they were in with a disabled child.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I think the committee should think very carefully about the move the government has made to say, `You can go back three months and claim on that, but you can't go back 12 months. Sure your child was disabled, sure there were costs there and sure you'll need the money now for the ongoing ability to deal with this situation, but too bad. You didn't know about it.

If this had been the situation when the allowance was first introduced, you might have been able to describe a limitation on the period in those terms. This payment has now been around for quite a long time. It appears&mdash;it is advertised, if you like&mdash;in the guide to family payments which 1.8 million families in Australia get each year and, in addition, on the birth of a new child. Doctors are regularly advised of the payment. Com <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> munity nurses and paediatricians are also well aware of it now, whereas it was a new payment some time ago.

I do not know whether there is any indication from the committee that it would be prepared to consider an in&hyphen;between amount of time. Now that the payment is well&hyphen;established and is known widely through the medical profession, through community nursing and also through many families, with it regularly being brought to their attention, and given the justification and the need for 12 months arrears&mdash;in other words, that families do not get to know about it for quite a long time&mdash;I would have thought it was not an unreasonable proposition to bring it into line with other payments.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to amendments Nos 86 to 91 standing in the name of the opposition, we will be opposing this part of the schedule to restore the divisor for calculating the lump sum compensation preclusion period to average weekly earnings. Pensioners and allowees affected by this measure will otherwise be subject to much longer periods without payment, forcing them to use up their compensation at a much lower rate before they are eligible for financial assistance or for continued assistance. Our amendments are written in a way that retains the beneficial provision for partners included in the schedule.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Opposition amendment No. 92 applies in relation to schedule 20. Labor supports measures which encourage social security recipients to maximise the return on their resources but this measure relies on pensioners and allowees being able to access safe accounts which pay interest at the deemed rate. In the current climate where interest rates have been officially cut but where the minister must again consider whether or not to cut the deeming rates, this concession on the first $2,000 for a single person or $4,000 for a couple is especially critical to pensioners and allowees. Under half of all financial institutions make these available. Not all are available to all pensioners and allowees. Very few currently offer the deemed rate of interest on small deposit accounts of the below threshold rate. The measure relies on financial institu tions moving to provide accounts which pay the deeming rate on these accounts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is little evidence that the financial institutions will do this. That is the truth of the matter. Some regional banks have recently moved in exactly the opposite direction, from paying five per cent on amounts under $2,000 to paying one per cent. There are an estimated 721,000 pensioners, about 600,000 from DSS and the remainder in the Department of Veterans' Affairs, and around 60,000 allowees who will be affected. I commend this amendment to the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

This schedule of the bill will apply the lower deeming rate of four per cent to the first $2,000 to $4,000 of savings held in bank deposits by singles and couples. I want to put it clearly on the record that these changes will not affect those people who have only small balances in the bank, due to the operation of the income free areas on social security payments. The original figures were that the people to be affected were allowees with over $30,000 in financial assets, single pensioners with more than $45,000 in financial assets and pensioner couples with more than $78,000 in financial assets.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On our informal running sheet, if you like, we are dealing now with schedules 21 and 22. Of course, in relation to schedule 21, the relevant opposition amendments are 93 to 97. They are about preventing the Department of Social Security from making all overpayments into recoverable debts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unrecoverable debts, in most cases, arise where a customer is overpaid due to an administrative error of the DSS. This applies whether or not the person realised that they were being overpaid. A debt may be identified quite a long while, possibly even years, after the overpayment. But this measure would force customers to repay money that they did not realise they owed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> It is for that reason that we oppose part 1 which gives effect to automatic rate reduc tions where a person complies with a requirement to notify being classed as debt and therefore recoverable. This would otherwise allow the department to act not promptly and still recover any overpayment arising from this lack of promptness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will be opposing part 2 which gives effect to new provisions which would make any overpayment arising for reasons not codified in other sections of the act&mdash;in other words, foul&hyphen;ups from the department&mdash;a debt which is recoverable. We agree to part 3 which consolidates the overseas application of debt recovery provisions and methods of debt recovery. We oppose part 4 which is the removal of compulsion for the secretary to waive debts which arise solely as a result of administrative error. We will oppose items 99, 100, 101, 104 and 105 of part 5 which codify the circumstances in which a debt can be written off by the secretary because no discretion is provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to make what I think is a really critical point about this: the department itself requires people to notify it of relevant changes in circumstances within 14 days, and people are penalised if they do not meet that deadline. At the very least, I think the same standard should be expected of the department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's proposals effectively allow DSS staff to take as long as they like to put changes into the system. That is a double standard. There is one standard for, as the minister likes to say, the poor, the needy and the vulnerable in the community, and one standard for the department. That is not acceptable to the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to address opposition amendment 98, which relates to schedule 22. The opposition's approach is to seek to omit the schedule, to restore arrangements for the pension advance scheme. The number of advances and the amount of money involved in each advance would be reduced as a result of this measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The scheme has been very successful in helping JSA and NSA recipients participate in activities to help them find employment, and also in helping pensioners meet their living and capital expenses or those of a family <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7550"> member. To restrict the advances would restrict the activities that would lead to the advances being repaid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no evidence that this system is being abused. I would be interested to hear if the minister has any. The only justification for this measure that I am aware of is administrative simplicity. In simple terms, this is a measure for the minister, or for the Department of Social Security; it is not a measure for the people.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to indicate with respect to schedule 21 that the Australian Democrats will be supporting the ALP amendment which allows some small sections of schedule 21 to stand. At least, that is my understanding. I will get an indication from Senator Faulkner on that in a minute. However, we will oppose all other parts of the schedule 21.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's intention with schedule 21 is to allow the Department of Social Security to recover overpayments made as a result of administrative error. Those overpayments, where they are received in good faith by the customer, are not recoverable by the department. The risk with the proposal before us, however, is that it will remove any imperative on the department to be timely in processing information provided by the client as it can always go back and reclaim the money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because the income testing rules are so confusing, many people would not know what their correct entitlement should be. The Democrats believe that, in circumstances where people have received money in good faith, it would be grossly unjust to allow the department to turn around in six months or even 12 months time and try to recover those overpayments. The person has done everything required of them, and the department is solely to blame.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the level of savings that the government hopes to achieve from this measure, the Democrats are keen to see if some compromise could be reached. In preliminary discussions with the minister's office, we were not able to agree on such a system. I put on the record the Democrats' willingness to consider an alternative proposal which the government <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> might wish to put to us in the future on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Faulkner pointed out, clients have to notify the department within two weeks of the overpayment. It does not seem just for the department then to say that it can take as long as it likes to recover money, the payment of which was its fault. I seek an indication from Senator Faulkner that he is opposing most of schedule 21, apart from those items he has signalled as amendments to schedule 21. If that is the case, we would support his amendments. However, I stress that the bottom line for the Democrats is that the imperative must remain for the department to be efficient in dealing with these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to schedule 22, the advanced payment scheme, the proposed amendments will modify the operation of that scheme for pensioners and the unemployed. There will be some tightening of the scheme by setting the maximum amount available at $500 and by limiting the number of advances to one in any 12&hyphen;month period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is expected that these changes will improve recovery of advances by the department. At the same time the scheme will be liberalised through the removal of the requirement that people access advanced payments only for certain permitted purposes. Removal of this restriction will allow, for example, an unemployed person to use the money to purchase a fridge or to pay a rental bond. The Democrats will be supporting this schedule.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with Senator Woodley that there must be a certain responsibility on the department. If a person notifies the department that their circumstances have changed and therefore the benefits they can get have changed, and if they do that again and again but the department still sends the wrong amount, it is a bit rich, whatever the person's circumstances further down the line, that they can be held responsible for paying back the money. There should be some limit. No one expects the public purse to bear the cost of tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars in the exceptional circumstances where a benefit is paid and the recipient has only a marginal excuse keeping it. We would like the present <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7551"> situation to pertain but we support the ALP's proposed amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just want to go back one step and also say that, as with the Labor Party, we will be aiming to keep the limits on the deeming rate as far as pensioners' accounts are concerned. Taxing pensioners for small amounts of income that they did not get on money they have in the bank is what this is about. If there is $2,000 in the bank and the bank is paying less interest than what the government deems the interest ought to be, the pensioner gets taxed not on the amount of interest they are paid but on the higher interest that is nominated by the government. So we have this extraordinary situation where people on low incomes very often are paying tax on money they did not receive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know there are some complicated components to this but, again, I think the government ought to be legislating to bring the banks into order, not the pensioners. If this matter is going to be fixed up good and proper, let us have the government telling the banks what interest they should be paying, if necessary, instead of leaving it to their good offices and, where they do not pay the interest, penalising pensioners for income they did not get, particularly on $2,000 in the bank, for goodness sake.

I understand it is a very substantial amount, but that is a reflection on the efficiency of the department to a certain extent. Nevertheless, in this day and age of computers and what have you, there are inadvertent overpayments. I would have thought it obvious that all overpayments, by definition, must be inadvertent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government can say, `If banks overpay, they can recover debts.' But that is not quite the same when we are talking about the government and government servants. Let us take the principle where people rely on a ruling of the taxation commissioner. Having made full and true disclosure of the fact, they cannot be assessed to their detriment even if the commissioner's ruling is wrong at law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that we are in a different ball game here than is the Commissioner of Taxation but, nevertheless, I do take the point that was made by one of the honourable senators&mdash;I do not know who it was. Where, for example, the department has been notified by a beneficiary that there has been an overpayment and within the two&hyphen;week period that beneficiary has made the declaration of a change of circumstances and still the payments in respect of the old circumstances continue and the next payment comes along and that person goes back and says that they have advised them of their change of circumstances, surely that is a matter that should be taken into consideration by the department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Overall, I understand and acknowledge that there is a problem. I do not agree with the government in respect of the 13 weeks. That is absolutely out of the question. There is a two&hyphen;week period for notifying a change of circumstances, and I suppose under those circumstances you are looking at maybe four weeks in addition to that time. Should there be some problems in respect of overpayments, I suppose I can understand the need for the department to protect revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make the point clearly to the committee that I think the minister should give an assurance to the committee that the term `hardship' will not be defined as extenuating <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> circumstances to the extent that it means that the result will affect the recipient. There should be a rather liberal interpretation of the term `hardship' in respect of the recovery of debts due to an administrative error.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can see a problem if there was a computer error. If 100,000 recipients were each paid $10 a week extra for maybe five weeks then, my goodness, there is probably an argument to say that under those circumstances repayment should be claimed. I certainly would not go along with 13 weeks. I want a quite definite assurance from the minister with respect to the interpretation of the word `hardship' and a guarantee that the department's administrative systems attend to this problem fairly rapidly. As I understand it, the figure is something like $300 million. Could the minister advise the committee of that?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Harradine, the advice I have is that this item covers an amount of approximately $265 million. It is, as you say, a substantial sum. I recognise your concerns about the length of time in which it is proposed that the department could come back to reclaim debt. If I could get support for a proposal to take it back to six weeks I would be prepared to do that. There are technical problems with the department being able to guarantee that they can take action within the first four weeks, but within the first six weeks is possible. I think it also has the advantage of keeping pressure on officials to make sure that they keep these matters under review all the time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of things that I do think is perhaps appreciated by some senators is that&mdash;and I raised it the other day in this place&mdash;you have the opportunity to make the whole question of inadequate administration much more transparent. Currently, a lot of these overpayments and debts are not quantified to the extent that they are available to, say, the estimates committees, the Public Accounts Committee or the Auditor&hyphen;General. They are not identified specifically. This measure will make it much clearer to all concerned as to how well the department is administering this area of its <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7553"> responsibility. For that reason, I think it is a move in the right direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as individuals and hardship is concerned, there is a general rule that all overpayments should be repaid according to the recipient's capacity to pay. As far as people who cannot afford to pay are concerned, the department will not take action against a person who cannot afford to pay. If they could not pay by way of lump sum, which for most people is difficult, but they could repay by reasonable instalments without any penalty or interest, then they would be expected to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also protection for customers provided in the write&hyphen;off provisions of the act. They have been preserved in the government's amendments. If customers have no capacity to repay their debt, recovery action can be suspended indefinitely by the writing off of the debt under the act. This gives the Commonwealth the ability to resume recovery in the future if the person's financial circumstances improve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, in cases where there are other special circumstances that would make recovery unjust or unreasonable there is scope to waive recovery of the debt altogether. One of the issues that might properly be considered in this regard is the period over which the administrative error occurred. The decision maker is thus able to consider the totality of the circumstances in deciding whether recovery is warranted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do not forget also that customers who are dissatisfied with the decision about the recovery of their debt still retain access to the range of internal and external review and appeal mechanisms and they also have access and recourse to the Commonwealth Ombudsman. I would hope that those statements might deal with some of Senator Harradine's concerns as to the ability of people to pay and the hardship situation that they might find themselves in.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5K4">Senator FAULKNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This amendment is about maintaining pensions to at least 25 per cent of all male total average weekly earnings. I am hoping that this will be non-controversial and accepted around the chamber by all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a lot of concern about the report of the National Commission of Audit to the government in June 1996. The key recommendation of that National Commission of Audit report was that the government should review its policy for adjustments of pensions and benefits. Options available for future pension increases include:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If an average weekly earnings benchmark is still to be employed, consideration be given to median total average weekly earnings being used as a better measure of community standards.</PARA>
<PARA>And:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If an average measure is to be used then total average weekly earnings, AWE, be used in place of MTAWE.</PARA>
<PARA>This recommendation of the National Commission of Audit caused enormous concern <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7554"> around the community, particularly taking into account the fact that the National Commission of Audit was a creature of the Howard government. I do note that on 26 November 1995 the then Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) was very quick to publish a press release headed `Pension Guarantee', which said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is clear and absolute Coalition policy both to index pensions on a twice yearly basis in accordance with the Consumer Price Index and as well maintain their value at 25 percent of average weekly earnings.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Newman, in response to a question without notice on 25 June 1996 and quoting a press release of hers, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has ruled out fixing pensions by any different formula. The government maintains its commitment to pensions being determined at 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings.</PARA>
<PARA>To be fair to Senator Newman, in her second reading speech on this bill, she also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we can keep our commitment to maintain pension payments at 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings; and we have listened to the welfare sector and sought to introduce some of their suggestions for reform.</PARA>
<PARA>It would be appropriate for me to acknowledge that those statements have been made either in the parliament or by the vehicle of press release by both Senator Newman and Mr Howard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the opposition's intention today to amend this social security legislation that is before the Senate so as to cement in legislation the 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings benchmark for pensions. If the recommendation of the National Commission of Audit were to be accepted, it would effectively take millions and millions of dollars out of the pockets of pensioners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to ensure that the current benchmark that Labor has been committed to, literally for generations, is secure. The way to do that is to pass this amendment and have it enshrined in the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill which is before the Senate today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By making this very important amendment, the Labor opposition might be able to ensure that this is one pre-election promise that the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Howard government keeps. I am hopeful that this amendment will gain unanimous support in the chamber and, if it does, this opposition initiative very clearly will put the minds of hundreds of thousands of Australian pensioners at rest.</PARA></SPEECH>

It starts off in (a) to say that there is already a section 1206D in the act&mdash;it happens to deal with rent assistance.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the light of the advice that Senator Newman has, I am pleased to receive that response from the Prime Minister. It would be churlish to persist if there is a technical problem with the amendment that has been drafted. For the opposition, of course, the jury is always out on these matters and it remains to be seen, but Senator Newman has some hastily scrawled handwritten advice suggesting that that is the case.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If Senator Newman would be willing to give me an undertaking that the government will bring back a proposed amendment to the Social Security Act early in the next session to enshrine the principle that I am arguing for in legislation&mdash;and I think that is what she is in effect saying to the committee&mdash;then I would accept that commitment, if she was willing to give it in that form.</PARA>

<PARA>The Labor opposition has circulated some five amendments to the further budget and other measures bill. The first four amendments I would like to say a few words about. The fifth amendment, which deals with rental assistance, my esteemed colleague Senator Faulkner will deal with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The four amendments relate to the proposed deeming of earnings on superannuation for a person who reaches the age of 55 and the subsequent adjustment down of their various social security benefits such as unemployment and disability pension, depending on the level of their superannuation asset. I spoke extensively on this in the second reading debate. This matter has been examined by the esteemed Select Committee on Superannuation <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> chaired by my esteemed Tasmanian colleague Senator John Watson who, I should say, is not a member of the Labor opposition; he is a Liberal chair of that committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The intention of the four amendments is to ensure that a person who has $250,000 in superannuation assets is not affected by deeming their superannuation. So people who have more than $250,000 in superannuation assets would be affected by the government's proposals. The second principle of our four amendments is to ensure that a person who has made an investment after 20 August is affected by the measure. So superannuation accrued after that date and where it reaches $250,000 is deemed&mdash;as the government is suggesting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I just want to make a few comments about why we have picked a figure of $250,000. I know the minister has argued that this is too high a figure and that we should treat asset classes consistently when a person reaches the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> age of 55. Labor believes that superannuation is a different type of asset class. It is long-term investment for a person's retirement when they reach the age of 60 and beyond.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was certainly understood by the Australian people&mdash;up until this measure was announced on budget night&mdash;that superannuation is a long-term investment. We have actively encouraged investment in superannuation. Certainly the 67,000 people who will be affected by this measure believed that&mdash;up until budget night.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason we have chosen that figure of $250,000 is that&mdash;if $250,000 is converted into an annuity or pension income stream when a person reaches 60 or whatever age they choose to take that income&mdash;if a person went to purchase an annuity or a pension for $250,000 at today's market interest rates, it would earn you $6,500 to $7,000 in an income stream. That would roughly equate to some $16,000 or $17,000, depending on the annuity or the pension you could buy. That is not a lot of money. We believe that that is an appropriate cut-off figure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The other point about ensuring that superannuation money accrued after 20 August is taken into account is that there is a significant element of retrospectivity in what the government is proposing. People were encouraged into superannuation by both the current government and Labor over a long period of time&mdash;I think since about 1951 when the then Menzies government introduced a range of tax incentives for superannuation. That has been understood up until 20 August, budget night this year. We do not see why people should have to unravel their retirement plans. Therefore, we regard the measure as retrospective in its effect. We believe this measure should take effect for superannuation investment accrued after 20 August, budget night.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> They are the reasons for the Labor opposition's four amendments. There has been extensive debate on this issue in the media, in the select committee hearings and in the debates on the second reading. The government's measure announced in the budget was certainly not referred to in the coalition's election manifesto when it went to the people in March this year. Therefore, this <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7561"> is a blatant breach of election commitments given to the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people that will be hit the hardest by this measure&mdash;those who have less than $250,000 in superannuation&mdash;are people who gave evidence to the committee. I give as examples an electrician, a bank clerk and a railway worker who have retired at the age of 55. The ones who will be hit the hardest are elderly people who reach the age of 55, who are unemployed and who find it very difficult to obtain a job. We have a range of questions that we would like to have asked you, Minister, but I understand the time constraints so I will keep my comments to that at this stage.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule 1</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Superannuation assets for older people</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently, assets held in superannuation and roll&hyphen;over funds are exempt from the means tests on most Social Security payments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is seeking to remove this exemption for those people aged between 55 years and Age Pension age once they have been on an income support payment for nine months.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Budget papers show that as a result of this, 54,000 people will have their Social Security payments reduced and 12,900 will lose their payment entirely.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government argues that this move is justified on the grounds that these people should be `expected to use their superannuation savings for self&hyphen;provision before calling on the Government for income support'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Democrats will not be supporting this change.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(As Senator Allison has said . . . )</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe it is poor policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe it is inequitable in its impact.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And we believe it is breach of the undertaking the Coalition gave prior to the election that there would be stability and security in our superannuation system. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If implemented, this measure would force people, many of whom are disabled or are involuntarily unemployed, to use up their assets as a time when the government should be encouraging them to maintain those assets for retirement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister has argued previously that people will not be required to eat into their superannuation. To sustain this argument you need to draw what I would see as a totally artificial distinction between a person's superannuation capital and the interest that accrues on that.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In reality, people simply look at the total amount they have in superannuation as their superannuation savings and, if the affected people want to maintain their current lifestyle, they will have no option but to draw down on those funds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Figures released at the Estimates hearings showed that, for example, a single 58 year old on a Mature Age Allowance with $150,000 in superannuation will be $81,478 worse off by the time they reach Age Pension age if this change proceeds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While $150,000 may sound like a lot of money we need to remember that these are the funds that people were hoping would support them through&hyphen;out 20 or 30 years of retirement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ironically, having been forced to draw on that money for up to ten years, those people&mdash;who previously might have been totally self&hyphen;sufficient in retirement&mdash;may then qualify for an Age Pension.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The other point I would take issue with the Minister on is her recent statements that superannuation assets are no different to other assets and should, therefore, be treated no differently to things like shares or investment properties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It seems to me that this view totally ignores the multi&hyphen;party acceptance over the past few years that superannuation assets are indeed different to other assets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What we are talking about is sacrificed income that people have put away, with Government encouragement, to help provide for themselves in their retirement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . And I stress the point that the Government have encouraged people to invest in superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That encouragement has been provided through concessional taxation treatment because it is snot only in the individual's best interest to invest in superannuation but also, from the view of national savings and relieving the pressure on our Age Pension system, in the Government's best interests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is these factors which set superannuation apart from assets such as shares and investment properties and it is these factors which the Minister seems unable, or unwilling, to acknowledge. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7562"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A further point that needs to be made is that at the inquiry held by the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation we heard that the Government has not undertaken any long&hyphen;term modelling on the effect of this change.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It seems clear that to a large degree there is a false economy here&mdash;people being denied a payment, to give the Government savings now, who'll then receive a higher payment further down the track.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, to date, I have not seen any detail on just how people are expected to access the interest the Minister says they can live on. Superannuation funds are not going to be making fortnightly interest payments to assist people to top up their income support payment.</PARA>

Despite what Senator Sherry said, there are a number of other savings that are, in fact, long-term ones.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can think of nothing more compelling than the investment which many people in Australia put into their small business. It may not be the same small business that they started out their working life in but they roll over their capital into one small business after another. They do this with the view that it will be their nest egg for retirement. I would suggest that that, too, is a long-term investment for retirement income.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule 2</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reduce Rent Assistance for singles</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From July next year, the maximum amount of Rent Assistance available to single people who share accommodation will be cut by one third from $73.80 a fortnight to $49.20 a fortnight&mdash;a reduction of $24.60.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government justifies this on the grounds that "single people who share accommodation can achieve cheaper housing costs than single people living alone".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As result of this change, around 80,000 people lose up to $25 a fortnight. Most of those affected will be unemployed people but a significant number of Age and Disability Support Pensioneers will also be disadvantaged.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are a number of points that need to be made in setting out our opposition to this proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Firstly, people, particularly young people, are often forced to share accommodation because the level of their unemployment allowance is below the poverty line.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The biggest economy of scale these people reap is cheaper rent and, because they pay less rent, they receive less Rent Assistance. Thus, the current system already takes account of economies of scale.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, while people may achieve economies of scale other than rental costs by sharing accommodation, reducing Rent Assistance to account for these savings would not be appropriate as, in the Department's own words, "rent assistance is not intended to meet non&hyphen;housing costs".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thirdly, if, as a result of this change, unemployed people move to a cheaper area they may end up losing their social security payment of 6 months.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Typically, the cheaper areas to live are those on the outskirts of town or in regional areas and are usually those with lower employment prospects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So people may be caught in the unenviable position of being trapped into payhing an extra $25 a fortnight rent for risk of losing their payments for 6 months. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fourthly (as Senator Allison has said) there are may Disability Support Pensioners who, as part of the process of de&hyphen;institutionalisation, have been placed in group housing. If this change goes through, any of those disabled people who share a major area of accommodation&mdash;such as a bathroom, bedroom or kitchen&mdash;will have their Rent Assistance slashed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, as if that wasn't enough, I'd draw the Senate's attention to the fact that the Coalition's pre&hyphen;election Social Security policy document specifically stated, and I quote:</PARA>

Senator West did mention this as she was speaking at <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7566"> a fast rate, but I want to put on the record that the government has recognised that there are special conditions which apply to disability support pensioners in terms of their vulnerability and their special needs.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When looking at that, we saw that it would be anomalous and often very difficult if people on a carers pension were not looked after in the same way.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There you are; you were listened to. I do commend that amendment to the chamber because it does recognise those who are most vulnerable which, as I have said, is what we have tried to do all along. The government stands by its position on shared renters. Under the current arrangements, two people sharing can have an extra $80 a fortnight more than a couple sharing. Even under the new arrangements, two singles sharing will still have $30 a fortnight more than a couple.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Minister, as I recognised earlier, I do <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> say that is great. However, I still have major concerns with the issue. To say that singles are getting more than couples is a bit trivial. Couples have the advantage that they can live and rent a one&hyphen;bedroom unit, apartment or facility without running the risk two singles would if they were renting a one&hyphen;bedroom place. The couple will not have Social Security coming in to check what the sleeping accommodation is. With singles, if two of them happen to be sharing a one&hyphen;bedroom place, Social Security will be in to check that they are in single beds, so they are up for a great deal more invasion of privacy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, I have a question. I think there is an unintended consequence of this amendment. I will go back to my grotty tenement place where we have the shared bathroom and shared kitchen. I ask you: is it now not true that, as a result of this amendment that you are going to move, you could have in one room someone on a disability support pension, perhaps with a psychiatric disability or some other sort of disability, sharing the kitchen and bathroom with somebody who is in receipt of an old age pension and who lives in the next room? That person who is in receipt of the old age pension will get a reduction in rent assistance. The person on the disability support pension will not get any reduction in their rent assistance, but the old age pensioner, the widow pensioner or any other of those sorts of beneficiaries, is going to cop a reduction in their rent assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Usually the people living in these situations are single, elderly women. Maybe they are widowed or maybe they have been single and never worked in an occupation that has enabled them to have superannuation and they are totally dependent on the flat basic rate of the old age pension. They will suffer a cut in their rent assistance while the person on the disability support pension who is living in the room next door, sharing the same facilities, will not have their rent assistance cut. Is that not an anomaly? Is that not discrimination against that old age pensioner?</PARA>

It is designed simply to take money out of poor people's pockets, out of the pockets of the vulnerable, to meet a government need to give rebates to corporations which have been able to lobby this government more effectively than people who have been living in pretty hard circumstances in shared accommodation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2). I think I should recount a story <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7569"> I recounted to somebody recently about the kind of situation the Senate finds itself in. I used the term `squirrel handshake' and the person concerned said to me, `What on earth is a squirrel handshake?' and I said, `A squirrel handshake is like the situation the Victorian legislature has the Senate in over this bill&mdash;namely, that it is referring something to us which we want, but it is referring it to us in a manner which makes it very difficult for us to amend.' He said, `Yes, I understand that, but what does a squirrel handshake mean?' and I said, `It's an old sporting term from my part of the world which refers to someone squeezing your nuts.' That may not be all that parliamentary, but it is very explicit about the situation we have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question for this Senate is: do we accept or reject the referral? On balance, we think we should, so do the unions and, incidentally, so do Labor and the Democrats. This bill's giving legislative effect to the reference of Victoria's IR powers to the Commonwealth is not quite a mouse, but it is not quite a lion either. Hopefully in time the two governments will advance to a complete system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the time of the announcement, we were told by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), by Minister Reith and by Premier Kennett that this was a historic achievement, unprecedented in 96 years of Commonwealth government, and a massive change of massive benefit to workers and employers alike in Victoria. That is a little hyperbolic, but it is certainly the first time we have been faced under the constitution with a unitary system for a state and the Commonwealth on industrial relations, or at least the progress towards one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> However, when the Victorian state legislation was tabled, a different reality emerged. True, Victoria has proceeded to refer industrial relations matters to the Commonwealth, but not all of them. We welcome the referrals that have occurred, and we welcome the fact that the Victorians have finally accepted the reality and benefits of the federal system. But those matters that have been referred are qualified. The reference is, unfortunately, subject to overriding Victorian legislation at any time and can be withdrawn by the Vic torian cabinet at any time, in which case we will return to the situation that pertained prior.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Industrial Relations Commission will not enjoy the power invested by every state commission of making comprehensive common law awards. Its power over Victorian public servants, particularly the between 10,000 and 11,000 police, is severely curtailed. Indeed, it is difficult to fully see just what altogether Victoria is ceding with respect to its own employees. True, we do know it is ceding unfair dismissal powers but that was only under the threat of the Democrats and the Senate dragging them into the federal jurisdiction with the external affairs power anyway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should be pointed out that, courtesy of the fast&hyphen;track mechanism placed in the industrial relations acts by the ALP and the Democrats in 1992, the vast bulk, at least three&hyphen;quarters, of Victorian workers have already exited the Victorian system for the Commonwealth. The last group of Victorian public servants finally achieved their first federal award yesterday. Each constitutional challenge by the Victorians was rejected by the High Court allowing justice for Victorian workers but at the expense of millions of dollars of workers' and taxpayers' funds wasted in futile litigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is of benefit to the Commonwealth figure of between 100,000 and 200,000 workers left in the Victorian system and the Victorian figure of up to 400,000. Take your pick, it is certainly not more than one&hyphen;quarter of Victorian workers. It will allow easier access to federal awards, to certified agreements and to Australian workplace agreements. It will provide access to protected industrial action for workers on collective agreements at the conclusion of their agreements, for workers on individual agreements when the agreements are deemed to end in three years, and for all other workers immediately.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will preserve the minimum underpinning conditions of the Victorian industrial relations system, but with the AIRC taking over the role of setting minimum wages. It will ensure that no new employment agreements can be entered into under the Victorian system. All <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7570"> new agreements will have to be vetted by the commission or the Employment Advocate as certified agreements or Australian workplace agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Victorian workers will not any more have to contrive an interstate dispute to access the federal award making powers. However, unions will still need to log employers because the Victorians would not cede common rule powers. They will still need to show that the making of an award is in the public interest and where there is a bona fide employment agreement in place, which has the support of both employers and employees, the commission will not be able to proceed to make an award to override the agreement unless it would not be contrary to the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the committee stage, I will be moving an amendment to exclude the operation of section 111AAA where agreements are not bona fide&mdash;that is, where agreements were not genuinely made; for example, where agreements were made under coercion or duress. Given that the Victorian employment agreements were not vetted and given the parlous state of the Victorian labour market over the past four years, evidence at the Senate inquiry into the Workplace Relations Bill was that many employment agreements were able to be forced on employees and with them substandard working conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats do not believe, and obviously because they will support our amendment, neither does the government, that such employment agreements&mdash;in other words, those which are not bona fide&mdash;should be recognised as adequate for the purposes of section 111AAA. We will be moving to ensure that workers subject to such employment agreements have prompt access to awards. I also note that the commission retains its powers under section 111(1D) to make interim awards for such employees quickly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats are also concerned about two other aspects of the bill. Firstly, we are concerned that the transitional arrangements for associations recognised in the Victorian system could become a back door means for associations to avoid the registration requirement of the federal system. We wish to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ensure that important protections, such as the conveniently belong rule in section 189, apply fully to those organisations and that transitional recognition arrangements end after one or two years. I ask the minister to address this issue in the drafting of regulations and to ensure that the ACTU, employer groups and the major parties concerned are consulted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats are further concerned that section 493(2) will allow regulations to proscribe state laws of Victoria which can override federal awards. The Victorian state reference legislation already sets down what are in our view far too many situations where they can override federal awards and we would be most concerned about a large number of other laws being proscribed in federal law in addition. I seek an assurance from the minister that this power would be used sparingly to preserve to the greatest degree possible the integrity of the federal award system when dealing with those workers who are not presently within it. With these comments, I wish to indicate that the Democrats will be supporting the government's bill and we will be supporting the government's amendments.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Jeff Kennett was pleased with the Commonwealth's industrial relations bill. This bill gives effect to the announcement by the Victorian and Commonwealth governments on 11 November 1996 with respect to the partial referral of Victoria's industrial relations powers to the Commonwealth using section 51 (xxxvii) of the federal constitution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As indicated in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bills Digest</EMPHASIS> this referral will allow Commonwealth industrial laws to apply to people and activities which would otherwise be outside the scope of its constitutional powers. It should also be noted that the scope of the bill is largely determined by the matters conferred on the Commonwealth by the Victorian parliament in the Commonwealth Powers (Industrial Relations) Act 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the outset, I would like to repeat the concerns I outlined when the motion to exempt this bill from the cut&hyphen;off motion was debated. That concern relates to the undue haste with which this legislation has been <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7571"> pushed through this parliament. The reality is that this bill, which represents one of the most important constitutional changes in the industrial relations arena this century, could have been debated in February next year. It is important in this context to note that the proposed intergovernmental agreement between the Commonwealth and the Victorian governments in relation to this issue will not be finalised until early next year. Why then are we debating this bill in a limited time frame on the last day of sitting for 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst I am pleased that the bill was referred to the Senate Economics Committee for a quick examination, the fact remains that many of the people who made submissions to the committee were forced to throw together their ideas at extremely short notice and with very little information. I am sure that many of the implications of the bill will not become apparent until next year. By that time, it will be too late.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support the minority report of Senators Sherry and Cook but I believe that, if the ALP amendments are not passed, the bill will not be supportable. I will not discuss the amendments in detail at this point, but I feel that on balance the protections inherent in these amendments will improve the bill sufficiently to enable me to support it. Without them, this bill has too many grey areas, and I feel it would be inappropriate to support such a bill largely on trust.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yes, to a certain extent we have been caught between a rock and a hard place, but it is a bit like being forced to change your clothes in a cupboard. There was always another alternative, and that alternative was to wait until February and deal with this properly.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are some comments I would also like to make on behalf of the Labor Party during the second reading debate of the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996. This is indeed a unique piece of legislation and, at this late stage of the sittings, I appreciate Senator Murray's humour in referring to it as a `squirrel handshake'. Carrying that analogy a bit further, I feel less constrained than my <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> colleague in that I cannot have certain things squeezed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As has been pointed out, the bill is a mechanism by which the Commonwealth receives a referral from the state of Victoria. I am perhaps familiar with this type of behaviour from the Premier of Victoria. I was somewhat amused in the hearings of the committee when we became apprised of the fact that Victoria and the Commonwealth were preparing to enter into an intergovernmental agreement to underpin this legislation, but the agreement itself had not yet been finalised and certainly could not be made available to us the very people considering the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I posed a question in those hearings as to how we were to consider what potential amendments might be appropriate, the response was that I was proposing a double hypothetical. I pointed out to the department official at the time that half of that hypothetical was actually the government's, and perhaps that is the major criticism in relation to this bill. It is extremely hypothetical and we have many concerns with respect to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will be moving several amendments in relation to those concerns but, at this stage, I would like to highlight the main concern. Our central criticism of the reference and of the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) as a whole is that, contrary to the rhetoric of the Victorian government in particular and also the federal government, it does not represent a giant leap forward towards a single system of industrial relations. To the contrary, the effect of the reference and of the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) is to graft on to the federal industrial relations system the existing Victorian industrial relations system. In effect, the principal features of the Victorian system are continued under the auspices of the Commonwealth legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I dread to think when it was accepted that there were several complexities with the Workplace Relations Act, but it was claimed by the government that this bill was solving several problems. I dread to think what act we might ultimately end up with if other states <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7572"> were also to agree under this sort of environment to refer their powers as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The major concerns we have&mdash;and I will deal further with them in the amendments as we deal with them&mdash;are all of the exclusions. The problems with this bill are not only the way in which Victoria has been accommodated into the federal act and the compromises that have been made to that effect but also the several areas of exclusion and the results consequent to those. I will deal further with those issues as we move on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To conclude, it is our view that the reference as a whole and the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) as a whole are in many ways a disappointing second best outcome. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that the reference and the bill may provide advantages to some workers while not disadvantaging any others&mdash;although there have been some questions raised to that effect by the Victorian police. For these reasons, our present inclination is to vote in support of the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2), subject of course to seeking support for the amendments that we will proceed with.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with all that has been said so far in relation to the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996, but I will add a few thoughts of my own. These powers have been referred, as have other powers in the past, to the Commonwealth from Victoria under section 51(xxxvii) of the constitution&mdash;the states can give and the states can take away. That does lead, as has been already suggested, to uncertainty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would ask the relevant government senator, when replying to our speeches during the committee stage, to tell us what guarantees, if any, the state of Victoria has given to leave these powers with the Commonwealth at least in the foreseeable future so that the Commonwealth can proceed with its legislation and be assured that that legislation will be stable for some years to come.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also wish to raise an issue that really has to do with Victoria but, since the Commonwealth is taking on these powers, it has some responsibility to see that what has been left <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> behind in Victoria has been attended to in a proper way. There are two points I would like to raise and perhaps receive an answer to during the committee stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first point is in relation to the Employee Relations Commission of Victoria and what is going to happen to it. Is the same thing going to happen to that as happened to the Accident Compensation Commission, which I think would be most unfortunate? In other words, are the personnel on that body going to be attended to? Is there any intention, for example, to appoint the people presently on the Employee Relations Commission of Victoria to the federal body? It may be that the federal body will have additional powers and responsibilities which will mean they will need further people on it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In any event, I want to raise as a big issue for us as the Commonwealth&mdash;and of course it relates to Victoria directly but it also relates to the Commonwealth takeover of these powers&mdash;what is going to happen with the Employee Relations Commission of Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point I want to have clarified is what is happening with the proceedings that are currently under way with the State Public Services Federation. The battles that that union has had over the years with the state are going to have the outcome that they would have had, had these powers not been referred.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot of the debate about this quite historic legislation over the days and weeks since the agreement was announced by the Victorian and Australian governments has been in relation to how significant this referral is.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do ask in a rhetorical way that people who seek to downplay the significance of a referral of this type should do two things. Firstly, they should look at the debates on the arbitration and conciliation sections of the Commonwealth constitution that took place when the federation of Australia was formed nearly 100 years ago. They should look at the debate that took place among the founding fathers in relation to these powers and observe how careful they were to create a balance of power between the states and the Commonwealth in relation to industrial relations matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, I challenge people who would seek to downplay the significance of this&mdash;what I would regard as&mdash;historical agreement and referral to find anywhere else in Australian federal history a referral of such a significant power from one of the significant states of the Australian federation to the Commonwealth parliament. As much as you may seek, for good political reasons on the other side, to downplay the significance of this referral, it will go down in history as a significant event in the development of Australia's constitutional history.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although proposed section 493(2) is not required by the state referral legislation, it is one of the bases on which Victoria agreed to include the state public sector within the referral. The provision is not unprecedented. Section 121 of the Workplace Relations Act does not allow the AIRC to exercise jurisdiction over Commonwealth or territorial public sector employment in a way that is inconsistent with prescribed Commonwealth or territory laws. Similarly, state industrial laws typically make similar provision. Any public sector law prescribed under proposed section 493 will only prevail over an award or order made under the extended jurisdiction. It will also be specified in a regulation which can be disallowed by the Senate. I will respond to Senator Murray's specific point. There should be no fear of any sweeping use of this power, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7574"> as we do not expect Victoria to seek its wide use.</PARA></SPEECH>

The legislation that has been passed and proclaimed by the Victorian parliament and this legislation, which hopefully will be passed and proclaimed shortly, are the underpinnings of it. Victoria and the Commonwealth will make an intergovernmental agreement about the referral of powers. The agreement cannot modify or deviate from what is put in place by our two parliaments. The agreement will address operational issues, such consultation about legislation or a notice of any intention to change or withdraw from the referral, as I said in response to Senator Cooney's question. There has been no indication that the Victorian government or parliament proposes to withdraw any referral; it is quite the reverse. Constitutionally, it is a matter for the state to decide.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the parliamentary secretary for that response. The `very quietly and silently' issue is one that I think it is appropriate that we address at this stage. In the committee dealing with this legislation we unfortunately had no minister present. It was left up to very brave departmental officials to attempt to deal with this issue. We should have on the record the circumstances in which the parliamentary secretary was put on this issue as well. However, in committee we were given the clear impression that this intergovernmental agreement was proposed to underpin arrangements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Cooney has raised some quite valid questions in relation to this legislation. Obviously of relevance is the future functioning of the Victorian Employee Relations Commission. Other circumstances which have been raised at this stage are of equal relevance. I understand that some of the concerns that have been raised about registered organisations may well be satisfied and may well be part of such an agreement. But these are all things of which we are unaware. A matter of great concern too are statements to the effect that certain things may be dealt with in regulations. This is extremely unsatisfactory. I revisit the comment in my second reading statement that this is obviously a second&hyphen;best outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I indicated earlier, we will be proceeding with our amendments on the basis that we do not believe that some intergovernmental agreement which is unclear and not before us should be the basis on which not to move with amendments. Obviously some arrangements are being made outside the actual terms of reference in relation to the referral of these powers. We believe it is appropriate to deal with some of our issues in that environment, particularly when we are not privy to even the draft terms of discussions which very quietly might become available in a couple of weeks.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The effect of these amendments is to provide that common law contracts of employment entered into in future in Victoria must comply with both the Victorian statutory minima and the federal no disadvantage test. This concern is perhaps one of the greatest in relation to this bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the major concerns&mdash;and this example highlights it&mdash;is that under this bill some future employees that fall under such contracts will only have to meet the Victorian statutory minima. So, in effect, there are people that are left behind from this supposed new unitary system. In an attempt to accommodate Mr Kennett with his Christmas present, we have left these people out. This amendment seeks to rectify that problem by ensuring&mdash;and I highlight in particular for some future employees not currently under any type of employment arrangement&mdash;that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> those future employees will have to meet the federal minima.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are very concerned that common law contracts of employment are to continue under the agreement between the government and Victoria; nevertheless, we accept it. But we find it very difficult to accept that these contracts should only be underpinned by these Victorian statutory minima. Those minima are woefully inadequate. They do not protect enough terms and conditions of employment and, where they do, the protection is inadequate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not think that this parliament should be party to continuing these inadequate minimum conditions in perpetuity, at least for new contracts in the future.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only that; the simple truth is that if this reference of powers is to create a true, single system of industrial relations in Victoria, surely the same minima should underpin employment contracts, be it a certified agreement, an AWA or a common law contract of employment. That is the principle applied by the Workplace Relations Act and that is what should be applied in this bill. This amendment ensures that in this respect there is consistency. If the no disadvantage test is good enough for employees on AWAs and certified agreements, it should be good enough for employees on other types of employment contracts, in particular, prospective employees.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the transitional period, the former recognised associations will be able to decide whether or not they wish to become fully registered under the WR act. If they decide to seek that status, they will have to meet the ordinary requirements for registration. There will be no alteration to the `conveniently belong' provisions. This does not apply, of course, to any former recognised organisation which is already a federally registered organisation or a branch of one. The government will consult the ACTU and the ACCI about the content of the regulations through the National Labour Consultative Council processes.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just going back very briefly to the parliamentary secretary's response to my earlier comments, I suppose I might add my own anecdote. I have often accused my father of having a convenient memory. It seems this government has convenient consistency. It uses the consistency argument when it is obviously to its advantage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me point out one major area of inconsistency that is being brought in with this legislation. What does not come with this legislation into the Commonwealth arena is the ability to make common rule awards. So there are going to be many more employers that are going to be subject to these types of employment agreements. You can't have your cake and eat it too. If you want to use the consistency argument, why are we not treating Victorian employees consistent with those which are in the federal arena through other means? The lack of an ability to make a common rule award is going to leave many of these Victorian employees in the position where they may come under Commonwealth contracts and, of course, they are going to face the much lower Victorian minimum test.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">WORKPLACE RELATIONS BILL&mdash;LABOR AMENDMENTS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ALP No.2:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats will oppose this amendment. This amendment seeks to include a new and worrying level of complexity into the industrial relations system. To give an example, in an award free area, one employer might offer an employee $40,000 p.a. for a 40 hour week. But they would be prevented from doing that unless they came to the AIRC and got that offer of employment ticked off as fitting the no disadvantage test. In every State of Australia, common law contracts are not affected like this. If there is an award in place, the common law contract cannot override the award, and that will also be the case in Victoria. But, this goes much further than that. The Democrats approach in it's amendment of seeking to ensure that access to the award system is enhanced we naturally think is a better alternative. I might also note that no new employment contracts under the Victorian system will be permissible&mdash;if employers want a formal document lodged with an industrial authority, they will need to pursue an AWA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ALP No 3 and 4:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats oppose this amendment and believe the matter is adequately and simply dealt with by the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats have some sympathy for what the ALP is trying to do here, but I think these amendments will create unnecessary complexity in the system. The approach adopted in the bill of a deemed date is clear for all concerned. People have made agreements&mdash;they should stick to them. I might also add that the three year rule applies only to negotiated agreements&mdash;employees under deemed agreements will have immediate access to protected action.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ALP 7:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats oppose this amendment. We believe that the changes we have made to section 111AAA will remove the primary impediment to making awards where agreement not genuinely made are in place. Paragraph 111(1)(g) gives the commission discretionary powers which we believe it is appropriate for the Commission to exercise in the making of awards.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SPEAKING POINTS FOR ALP AMENDMENTS TO WORKPLACE RELATIONS BILL (No. 2)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Oppostition (3) (4)</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment addresses what we see as an inconsistency in this Bill and in its relationship with the Workplace Relations Act.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill provides that a party on an existing individual employment contract cannot engage in protected industrial action until at least 3 years after the commencement of the Bill. The practical terms this means that for this 3 year period parties do not have the capacity to engage in industrial action to force entry to the Federal industrial relations system.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The problem we have with this provision is the insertion of a 3 year period after the commencement of the Bill. Where an employment contract has been on foot for some time prior to commencement of the Bill (anything up to 4 years) this means that protected action may not be available for anything up to 7 years of the life of the contract.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is clearly inconsistent with the Workplace Relations Act that provides a 3 year maximum period without the right to protected action.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our initial reaction to this problem was to recommend a 3 year period after commencement of the employment contract, whenever that might be. However, before the Committee Mr Stewart&hyphen;Crompton pointed out that many employment contracts in Victoria do not have a certain start date.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clearly this must be taken into account. In our view it can be.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We therefore seek to amend section 523 of this Bill to the following effect.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where the start of the employment contract is known to parties should not be entitled to engage <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7580"> in protected industrial action during the period of 3 years after the start of the contract.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where the start date of the employment contract is not known, the start date should be deemed to be 3 years prior to the date of commencement of this Bill, and the parties should not be entitled to engage in protected industrial action during the period of 3 years after this deemed start date.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Opposition (7)</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effect of this amendment is to provide quick access to the Federal award system where the subject&hyphen;matter of the dispute is a matter excluded from the Victorian reference of powers to the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are concerned that the reference of powers by Victoria to the Commonwealth is too restricted, and may exclude some important terms and conditions of employment.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Examples might include entry standards or qualifications to teach in Victorian Government schools; discipline of Victorian public servants by means of fines or demotion; procedures for making Victorian Government school teachers redundant. It also includes all terms and conditions of Victorian employees at the higher managerial levels in the public sector or in essential services or industries.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In practical terms, the effect of this restricted reference is that the Commission does not acquire jurisdiction to make awards in relation to these matters under the Victorian reference.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We can't amend the Bill to provide that the Commonwealth does acquire that jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">What we can do is to provide that, where the Commission otherwise has jurisdiction to make awards about these matters, the parties can gain quick access to that jurisdiction.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening we are debating two health bills. The Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 2) proposes to require medical graduates to complete postgraduate education in order to gain access to Medicare benefits. It is also to allow regulations to be made to reduce the Medicare benefit payable where multiple services are rendered and to increase the maximum amount a patient may be required to contribute towards certain medical procedures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly on this bill when we get to the committee stage I have a number of questions to raise and issues to pursue with the parliamentary secretary in relation to how the provider numbers issue is going to benefit rural areas. I am still not totally convinced that the moves the government says will happen will be the case.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7582">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second bill is the National Health (Budget Measures) Amendment Bill 1996, the purpose of which is to increase patient contributions under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, restrict access to subsidised drugs to Australian residents and a restricted range of members of overseas missions, and make minor changes to the indexation of various patient contributions. This slugs those who are in receipt of benefits and health cards and who, until this bill is passed, are paying $2.75 per prescription and, after it is passed, will be paying $3.25. This increase in co&hyphen;payment for the first time is not associated with any associated increase in pension rate. So many pensioners will be worse off financially to the tune of 50c per prescription.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know from the previous bills that we have been debating on social security that the government is committed to maintaining pensions at 25 per cent of male average weekly earnings but we can see that pensions are at a greater rate than that. This bill is going to cause people on pensions to have a reduction in their disposable incomes. This is an issue that I think is of great concern particularly to elderly people because, as I said earlier, people who live on age pensions and benefits do not have any significant amount of disposable income. They do not have discretionary spending.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The income they get is totally disposed of in the sheer, simple things of living; in covering their accommodation costs, their food and clothing. They do not have discretionary funding and this is of very great concern to those concerned about aged people. In the previous debate I raised the issue of people on old age pensions who could well be suffering a reduction in their rent assistance as well, so they are really being slugged on several different sides. The government is to be condemned for that. The opposition will be moving some amendments and I urge people to support them.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I begin my speech on the second reading of the health bills, I indicate that three hours debate has been allocated for this bill. We might informally allocate one hour to the second reading, an hour and a half <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to the committee stage of the Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 2) and only half an hour to the budget measures. If there is agreement from the government on that, they might want to indicate that when they proceed on the second reading.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a cognate debate on two bills which, on the face of it, have no relationship&mdash;but there is a unifying theme. These bills are in keeping with the general philosophy of this government; that is, to slug those who are the most vulnerable in our community, to reduce services to those who most need it and to charge those who have the least resources. This government has abandoned the Australian philosophy of a fair go. It is making major cuts to health in Australia. This Howard government does not believe that health care should be universal; it believes it should be provided only to those who can afford to pay for it. The principle that is in danger of being undermined in the current debate about health care and by the approach this government is taking in its budget and other measures is the principle of the universal provision of and universal access to health care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget and associated bills such as health insurance No. 2 have cut over $2 billion from expenditure on health care, most of which was used to offset the introduction of the private health insurance rebate. This has had very little impact on the quality or the extent of health care in Australia and the health care available to Australian citizens. This is in the face of evidence of premium rises that mean the rebate will have no impact on the cost of health insurance and will not make private health insurance more affordable for families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is what the community receives in exchange for massive cuts in federally funded medical services and reduction in the money given to public hospitals. All that this will do is to ensure that hospitals have no capacity to deliver the quality of service that, to date, they have been able to offer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The result of this reduction will mean longer waiting lists in the case of elective surgery and a very serious threat to the quality of care in the case of emergency and other medical services. It may also mean that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7583"> individuals, in fact, have to pay more, because a lot of services which the hospitals to date have been able to provide in&hyphen;house&mdash;physiotherapy, occupational therapy and social work&mdash;may not be able to continue to be provided. Patients may have to seek these services privately outside of a hospital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition has major difficulties with both these bills for three reasons, and they are quite simple: firstly, they are unfair; secondly, they have the effect of reducing the quality of health services provided; and, thirdly, they impact most heavily on the people who are least well off. The Labor opposition is opposed to the Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 2) and is opposed to three measures in the National Health (Budget Measures) Amendment Bill which increases co&hyphen;payments on pharmaceuticals. I will deal with the Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 2) first.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition believes that this bill will have unfair and retrospective effect on current medical students and interns. We are concerned that it may aggravate the shortage of doctors in rural areas and severely restrict the options of medical students and interns who are seeking to postpone their postgraduate training or undertake that training part time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition also does not support the increase in the maximum permissible gap for out of hospital medical services from $30.20 to $50. We do not support this change because patients who receive services of unusual length or complexity will face very high out&hyphen;of&hyphen;pocket costs. We do not believe that this situation is remedied by the Medical Benefits Advisory Commission's discretionary power to award higher fees for services of unusual length and complexity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In dealing with the work force issues, the opposition understands the necessity of managing the medical work force and, in particular, of managing access to Medicare to ensure that the Australian people get the best value they can for the money they provide to Medicare. The opposition also understands the need to ensure that those practising in medicine are of a good standard and that they are provided with appropriate training.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In recent years it was the Labor government who took decisions aimed at limiting the number of overseas trained doctors coming to Australia and who worked with the medical profession to improve the standing of general practice and develop a system of postgraduate training for general practitioners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem is that this legislation does not solve the problems and, at the same time, the legislation is unfair and its retrospective nature is adversely affecting the careers of medical students&mdash;those people who are already in the system. In fact, the Parents and Friends Supporting Medical Students said in their submission:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Current medical students and interns will be denied their rightful expectation, under training requirements existing at the commencement of their training, of eligibility for a Medicare provider number at the end of their internship year.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">That is, people who started their courses some six or seven years ago who are now completing their internship year are retrospectively affected so that the situation they relied upon when making their decision no longer exists.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This problem is exacerbated by the fact that this bill was not introduced in the parliament until some four days before its date of effect, which is 1 November this year. In fact, we are debating this bill well over a month after it is to come into effect. The government has indicated that if it is unable to secure passage of the bill, or if it does, anyone who has received a Medicare provider number between 1 November and the passing of the bill will have that provider number retrospectively taken from them.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A major problem of the provision of medical services is still the maldistribution of doctors and the shortages in rural areas in both hospitals and in general practice. This legislation, as I said, will not resolve that problem.  </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7584">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am particularly concerned about Dr Wooldridge's proposal which may also have an adverse effect on the provision of medical services in rural areas and on the options available to young doctors, particularly women, who do not wish to proceed immediately from their intern year to full&hyphen;time training. I am also of the view that the agreement reached between the government and the Australian Democrats, though designed at least by the Democrats to overcome this problem, may in fact make it worse, but I will explore this issue further in the committee stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The National Rural Health Network said in its submission that `the proposed restrictions on provider numbers will discourage junior doctors and medical students who are considering practising in rural areas', and that is really the crux of it. Several of the submissions and a number of witnesses, particularly women, have expressed their concern about the practical difficulties in getting a deferred or part-time training place and also that training arrangements are inflexible and do not allow for a variety of lifestyle choices and the demands of a family. Concern has been raised about these issues, but I do not wish to canvass them further, because we will have the opportunity in committee to deal with them much more adequately.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second part of the Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 2) is the maximum permissible gap being increased from $30.20 to $50. The opposition also does not support the intention of this bill to increase Medicare's maximum possible gap. This measure effectively reduces the Medicare rebate for out of hospital services with a value in excess of $202. This measure represents a fundamental breach of the coalition's election promise to maintain Medicare in its entirety. It is a regressive measure through which the government intends to raise $60 million from a group of people whose only distinguishing characteristic is that they require high cost medical treatment. The sorts of people who will be utilising these sorts of services will often be the chronically ill and the elderly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will now briefly deal with the National Health (Budget Measures) Amendment Bill. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> This bill is also in keeping with the general philosophy of this government; that is, to slug those who are the most vulnerable. The National Health (Budget Measures) Amendment Bill contains three changes to the pharmaceutical scheme that makes Australians worse off. It increases the cost to pensioners, it increases the cost to families and it changes the indexation rules so that co-payments increase more than they would have without this change to the indexation provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition believes that this bill breaches two of the government's major promises. The Prime Minister promised&mdash;and I quote in case anyone has forgotten&mdash;`to maintain the real value of pensions and other social security benefits'.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Further, this government promised to help the battlers. What could be more damaging to both pensioners and the battlers than to have the cost of medicines increased?</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill is decreasing the expenditure on pharmaceutical benefits by the sum of $540 million. Do you know what that means? It goes into the government's coffers and it comes out of the pockets of families and pensioners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am particularly concerned about the effect on pensioners. The co-payment has been increased from $2.70 to $3.20. Many people might argue that an increase of 50c is not very much and that it does not really matter. But, for a pensioner on a severely limited income, 50c can mean a great deal. The National Seniors Association said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">We are concerned that there is a danger that age pensioners will be put in a position where they cannot afford a script and they may well go without it.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">This was reinforced by a number of other witnesses. It is made worse by the fact that the link between the pensioners co-payment and the safety net and its connection to the pensioners allowance that is paid has now been broken. In fact, for the elderly who use a large number of prescriptions, they will be much worse off.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the Labor Party originally introduced a co-payment for pensioners, they were very careful about the way they did it. They introduced a pharmaceutical allowance for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7585"> pensioners, which was paid at the same time as their social security benefits, so that a pensioner would not be worse off. But this is a principle that this government has not seen fit to continue. The National Seniors Association, in giving evidence to the committee, also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Commonwealth seniors health card provides scripts at the concessional rate, but they will now be losing the hearing aid service and the dental service. So they are not only having an increase in the cost of pharmaceuticals, but they are also losing those two benefits.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">That essentially sums it all up for me. The effect of these bills&mdash;combined with effects of the budget generally in health and other areas&mdash;means that, if you are not doing very well in Australia at the moment, then you will be worse off as a result of the decisions of this government.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result, we will be opposing Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 2) in its entirety and in the National Health Budget Measures Amendment Bill we will be opposing three measures which relate to the increase in the co-payment. However, we will be supporting the fourth measure which relates to pharmaceutical benefits not being available for  non-residents and foreign nationals.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Health Insurance Amendment Bill No. 2.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">National Health (Budget Measures) Amendment Bill 1996</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I must say that there has been more of unnecessary concern whipped up over the issue of restricting Medicare provider code numbers for Medical General Practitioners to those who have undertaken the recognised training program than on almost any other matter I can think of.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The impression has been given that the Government proposal is something new and radically different from what has actually been happening in practice for the last 5 or 6 years. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The impression has been given that the Government is unfairly targeting young doctors eager to go out and work in the community by imposing unfair restrictions on them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The impression has been given that young doctors will not be able to find jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of course none of these impressions are true and one must ask what the real agenda is of those who are deliberately whipping up the anxieties of medical students and junior doctors on these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe there is a need for some objective assessment of the facts of this matter. Initially I would like to deal with the need for Gps to be adequately trained.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the good old days of 30 to 40 years ago or more, once a person had finished a medical course and done a year to two as a resident in a public hospital they were regarded as being well enough trained to go and set up a medical practice. The doctors of those days were universal generalists who delivered babies, took out appendixes, tonsils and gall bladders as well as giving anaesthetics and then went back to their surgeries where they consulted all day and in the evenings and overnight did house calls, or at least that was what the doctors did in my home town when I was a little boy in the 1950s.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In those days if you wanted to be a specialist surgeon the usual pathway was to go to England and do your primary Fellowship exams, spend a couple of years in a British Hospital, pass your final Fellowship and then come home and set up practice.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">But this is not the case any more.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over the last 20 or so years there has been both a great expansion in the body of medical knowledge as well as a great explosion in medical technology. Public expectations of doctors and the standard of service they should provide have also risen.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of this in the contemporary world 4 or 5 years of extra post&hyphen; graduate training is required for all medical specialities and that includes General Practice Medicine.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has been accepted around the world that General Practice or primary care medicine requires special training, just as much as does becoming a brain surgeon or cardiologist.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People entering General Practice Medicine need to have training relevant to the work they will do. This includes extra training in such areas as psychiatry, paediatrics, obstetrics, accident and emergency medicine and dermatology, etc. and then to have their knowledge tested to ensure that they have reached a sufficient level of competency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Quite apart from testing that their knowledge base is adequate in these days of high levels of medical <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7586"> litigation it is important that doctors should be able to demonstrate that they have undertaken a formal period of training and passed qualifying exams before entering practice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most importantly however, a trained GP is more discriminating in ordering the use of laboratory tests and imaging procedures such as Xrays, Ultrasounds, CTScans, and in some cases no doubt MRI scanning.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President it has been said that the most expensive piece of technology in the modern world is the ball point pen in the hand of a medical practitioner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The explanation of this comment is that with a stroke of his or her pen a doctor can order a whole range of tests and imaging all of which are expensive and mostly paid for out of the public purse.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The properly trained GP works to a diagnostic plan and is prudent in the use of tests which is not only good medicine but costs the public purse a lot less.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am sure we all know of doctors who order a battery of tests and xrays on every patient, but the truth of the matter is that such doctors are poor practitioners who are usually covering their lack of knowledge and competency by ordering many tests in the hope that something will show up.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GP training programs have been in place for some time in countries which we like to compare ourselves with, such as Canada and the UK. The Commonwealth has been steadily moving to bring Australian GP standards into line with other countries since the early 1990's when the Vocational Register was introduced. It was widely publicised that from 1 January 1995 entry to the Vocational Register would only be by holding the FRACGP, so that there was about 5 years notice of the fact that after January 1995 entry to unrestricted General Practice would require that the RACGP training program should have been successfully completed. That is to say these facts were well known to the medical students who will graduate this year from early years of their courses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So what is the actual situation with respect to young medical graduates today?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reality is that virtually no young doctors go out into unrestricted General Practice after completing their first year internship. Instead, according to a survey done by the Epidemiology Unit of the ANU in 1995, and which I have previously had incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> , on average Gps have spent an extra 3.6 years in extra hospital training before entering General Practice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, most young doctors who have wanted to be Gps prior to 1 January 1995, sought to enter the Vocational Register, and to do the FRACGP exams. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So Madam President, most young doctors are undertaking around 4 years postgraduate training and sitting the FRACGP to confirm their standards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In reality then, the proposals put forward by the Health Minister to require all doctors entering General Practice to undertake the RACGP training program really do no more than formalise the situation as it actually is in practice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact is most young doctors are doing the training anyway. All these proposals do is formalise the requirement of all persons who wish to enter General Practice Medicine to complete the training requirements to gain entry to the Vocational Register.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The option of a doctor who has dropped out of a heart surgery program to become a GP simply by virtue of his holding a medical qualification has gone&mdash;and so it should have. General Practice should not become a waste paper basket for doctors who fail to succeed in other fields of medicine.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Perhaps the most important point to make is that in the modern world medicine should be regarded as a 12 year course&mdash;6 years as an unpaid undergraduate and 6 years as a paid graduate trainee before a doctor can set up in private practice in any field of medicine and be authorised to receive payments through the Medicare system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another vital point which needs to be made is that it is only doctors who plan to enter private practice who need provider codes. Salaried doctors of whom there are an increasing number working in many fields of medicine, do not need provider numbers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is an important point to make.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The focus of the public discussion of this matter has been on provider numbers which are required for private practice but of course there are a wide variety of career prospects for doctors in salaried positions. Such options, apart from salaried clinical jobs, include careers in medical administration, public health, occupational and industrial medicine, community health, aviation medicine to mention but a few. Fee for service private practice is far from the only employment prospect for young doctors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In any case notwithstanding all the claims to the contrary, the Minister has made it clear that there will be more than enough jobs for the 1,200 medical graduates Australia produces annually, as has already been set out by him elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a Member of the Senate Community Affairs Committee which reported on this issue to the Senate, I am very pleased that a component of the revised package for this Bill is provision for a Medical Training Review Committee to oversee post&hyphen;graduate medical training, not only of Gps, but also of specialists. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7587"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This was a recommendation of the Government Members of the Committee, and arose from concern when it became apparent that there was no central register of medical training posts, the location of such posts or the percentage take up of such posts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The inclusion of this provision in the legislation in my view may do more to improve post&hyphen;graduate medical education in Australia over the long term than is realised today I suspect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In conclusion Madam President, I want to place on record my strong support for the general thrust of the Health Minister's plan to ensure that Gps in Australia do have adequate training before being permitted to enter unrestricted practice. I am sure these measures will not only be in the best long term interests of GP medicine, but more importantly of the Australian public who will reap the benefit of being cared for by better trained doctors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Coming as I do from the North of Western Australia, I also applaud the aspects of these measures which will mean that better medical services can be provided in rural and remote Australia.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will begin by looking at the Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 2) and then, if time permits, go on to the National Health (Budget Measures) Amendment Bill. I do want to begin with the one that looks at the government's decision to restrict eligibility for Medicare provider numbers to doctors because of the considerable interest that this has generated amongst a number of young doctors. Also, it is probably an issue about which there has been more than the unusual amount of misinformation spread.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats support the basic premise of this legislation. We believe that medical graduates wishing to enter general practice should undertake additional training. Beginning with our agreement with the decision of the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) to do that, we then had to begin looking at the best way to implement it because that is where the problems lie.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> We accept the argument and we indeed accept the evidence that undergraduate medical education does not prepare graduates for unsupervised general practice. We also note that it is not only medical graduates that face some additional training. The law is one area that comes to mind. Lawyers have to under take additional training before they become barristers and solicitors. So it is not unusual that, after finishing a period at university and indeed at TAFE, some additional on-the-job training is required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I am very aware of the concerns expressed by some doctors that the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners should not be given exclusive rights over GP training. I am aware of the many criticisms. Indeed, I have spent considerable time discussing this with a range of doctors and people interested in medical training. I am aware of the concerns that general practice training is becoming more and more like specialist training and is beginning to pick up some of the worst trends that we have experienced here in this country with specialist training. I will say more about that in a minute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe both general practice and specialist training should be opened up. We have dealt with that in some of the discussions with government and in some of the package that we have negotiated. But I do not believe the minister could simply have opted at this point in time to leave the college out of this legislation altogether, although I know that is what some doctors wanted to see. Indeed, it is the issue that has been raised with me again today. It is certainly something that we are aware of and will begin to deal with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to note that this bill actually provides for an alternative. If you look through the bill, you will find the words `the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners or a body specified in the regulations'. So there is already a possibility and a legislative option that that may indeed be where we head. So the potential is there, and we can in the future be looking at putting a range of different bodies in that general practice training role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to point out at this point in time that the government is about to commence a review of general practice training which will look at alternative training pathways, something that has been on the agenda certainly very publicly since the late 1980s. As part of the Democrats' negotiations with the minister, the new medical training review panel will be given a specific brief to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7588"> look at complaints about training, complaints about access to training, who is actually allowed in where and how many people are allowed in. This review panel will advise the minister on issues related to alternative training pathways. So there is movement on this issue, something I want to stress again for those young doctors who are concerned about what is happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that I believe the minister does have a genuine interest in addressing some of these long-term problems. Medical training is not an easy area in which to tread and to begin to make some changes, as many former Labor health ministers have no doubt found. There are some very powerful vested interest groups out there, all involved in defending their own patch, defending their own turf, digging trenches, defending the barricades the minute anyone looks like stepping in their general direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think they have to face that change is inevitable. I say to those colleges out there which replied to the questions from the department about what part-time training was on offer with, `None, none, none, none, none, none at the moment,' that things will change. They will have to get used to it. They will also have to get used to the fact that women should not be excluded, as they have been in the past, from a range of training opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From the time that the provider number restriction was announced, the Democrats have said, `We do not have a problem with the concept.' We have said that we do not believe that access to Medicare provider numbers is an automatic right. It is a privilege. It is a privilege bestowed by the Australian taxpayers. It is a privilege which attracts a significant amount of taxpayers' funds and, as such, I believe that we are entitled to place conditions upon the receipt of those funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats also accept the benefits to the overall health system of having medical graduates fill vacancies and training places in some of the less popular, less glamorous disciplines rather than using their Medicare provider number option to simply move out undertrained into areas where there is already an oversupply of general practitioners. We <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> support the government's stated desire of addressing in this way some of the maldistribution problems, but we do wish to state here that we still have a long way to go in seriously tackling many of the rural and remote issues when it comes to maldistribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So basically the Democrats believe this bill is on the right track and it is for that reason we sat down and began negotiations with the government. We were concerned about what was the impact of the provider number restrictions on medical graduates, on those who have recently graduated, in particular those who are going to graduate over the next three years. We felt the government's data was less than satisfactory and that, until more accurate data becomes available, the minister's assertion that there are more than enough training places to go around could not be relied upon. But, in saying that, I note that some of the extreme suggestions of 300 or 400 places short was not proven before us during the committee hearings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not only the government that is concerned about where and to what disciplines graduates are moving. The RACGP, in a letter to all senators, also claimed that adequate work and training places are available for junior doctors. But, they said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In disciplines and places which are unpopular, these posts are either unoccupied or filled by doctors on temporary visas doing work our own graduates will not do. As long as they have access to a provider number, they can make a living practising triage and referral medicine without further training, in major cities.</PARA>
<PARA>So while this assertion sounds reasonable, and it seems on evidence before the committee and anecdotal evidence that it certainly is supported, it is once again difficult to verify in the absence of accurate data the availability of work and training places. So, on the basis of the evidence presented to the committee, and after discussions with various colleges, we believe there probably will be some shortages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is where we set out with our negotiations with the government to try to put in place those 200 extra places a year. We were not successful in negotiating the full 200 places, but we do have a backstop position of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7589"> some 250 over three years, and I will say more about that in a moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats set out to get the government to put that safety net in place and to have it there for at least three years to ensure every medical graduate has either a training place or a job. We now have that safety net and I really find it a bit astonishing to hear the responses of some of the graduates today and, indeed, to find that we still have a Labor Party which is going to oppose this bill. After all, how many other graduates in other disciplines have guaranteed opportunities?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of a couple of phone calls and speaking to a few people today, I want to stress that the training these young doctors will go into is well paid. We are not talking about four or more years of unpaid training. The average salary around Australia for an inturn&mdash;that is, someone who is in the last year&mdash;is $35,000 plus overtime. The average salary for junior RMOs&mdash;that is, they are trained and out there in the public hospitals&mdash;is $50,000 plus overtime. Depending on the contracts, a lot more than that can often be offered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many work those incredibly ridiculous hours, and we have had figures suggested to us as high as $75,000 depending on what ridiculous hours the doctors have to work. This is one of the issues that we hope will actually be addressed as part of our package when the government sits down with the state governments to look at what is happening in our public hospitals. I really have great problems with doctors who are saying they do not want a $35,000 a year job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, I point out that there are thousands of people coming out of universities fully qualified, many with honours degrees and higher, who have no chance this year of getting a job in their chosen profession and will indeed be driving taxis. I think we have some 800,000 people on unemployment benefits. I think that perhaps a few graduates need to think about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to quickly go through the safety net that the Democrats have won from the government and just briefly mention 10 of the initiatives. Firstly, there is the 250 additional GP training places which will be made <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> available over the next three years in rural and regional areas. These places are the bottom line of the safety net. If a junior doctor cannot obtain a training place or a salaried medical position after 12 months on the register of opportunity, the government will make a new rural GP training place available to that doctor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some doctors are arguing that they do not want to be conscripted into this. No-one is telling them that is anything like conscription. They are not being forced to go. It is simply one of the options. We are looking, in return for that offer, at the government asking that they stay on and practice in a rural area&mdash;something that many teachers have in past had to do, me included, and something that many people in the public sector are required to do. I know the police force in many states requires a time of country service. Indeed, moving to the country is something our defence forces are more than used to&mdash;in some instances, I would say unfortunately because some of them seem to move an excessive number of times.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Basically, if we have a doctor in a rural area who cannot find anything else and is happy to do so, then they will have to stay on in a rural area. If they turn that down as well, then they are still free to go out and find themselves a medical job or indeed to move on and perhaps find something in the non&hyphen;medical work force. That is their choice. It is the choice that other graduates and other people have to make every day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, there will be a formal process to oversee the take up of medical training places. I will move amendments later in this debate to set up a medical training review panel to identify the number, type and location of the training places, identify the number of interns and RMOs available for placement and report to the minister for health on the numbers, if any, of training vacancies&mdash;where they are and what they are in&mdash;and to look at the applicants and to actually identify those that are genuinely unable to find places. The report of that panel will be tabled in parliament for all of us to see.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, there will be a register of opportunity to match new graduates with vacant <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7590"> hospital positions. Junior doctors will be able to join a register of opportunity and that will match them up formally letting them know where places are and making offers to them. As I said, if a doctor stays on that register for 12 months, then the offer of a country GP place will be made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fourthly, there is a sunset clause in the reforms. The legislation will cease to operate on 31 December 2001 unless its operation is formally extended by this parliament. This will compel the government to justify the success of this measure before it is extended. It is a good opportunity for all of us to have a very good look at exactly what has been happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fifthly, there is a mid&hyphen;term review of the effects of the provider number restriction to be tabled in parliament. The minister will be required by the legislation to report to the parliament by 30 June 1999 on the impacts of provider number restrictions and the take up of additional places as well as the current state of postgraduate medical training. As part of the review, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare will monitor the impact of the legislation on the delivery of services, the quality of services and, in particular, on the cost of health services to make sure that this legislation does not have the impact suggested to us that in some cases it may force up the cost of some general practice services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sixthly, there will be an extension of time in which GP training can be completed from four years to six years. This is particularly important for those young doctors who want to take time off to perhaps travel or for family responsibilities. GP training previously had been limited to four years. You had to get it over and done with or you were out. I stress here that part&hyphen;time training will have no limit on it. We are talking about full&hyphen;time training. You actually take one or two years out if you so wish.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Seventhly, there is a commitment to consult with the specialist colleges on promoting fairness and transparency in their selection processes and reporting the results of those consultations to the parliament. This is something I have been working on in my time in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this place as health spokesperson for the Democrats and I am very pleased to see that at last it is beginning to happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Eighthly, there is a commitment to discuss with the deans of medical schools additional increases in rural experience. I realise that they have already made a significant breakthrough recently, but we are still asking them yet again to look twice and three times for extra opportunities for their students to have rural and regional experience during the actual time that they are at university.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ninthly, there is a commitment to develop in conjunction with the states by the end of 1997 a package of reforms for RMOs and other salaried medical positions. This is something I do not think those doctors out there protesting have read. I am still getting phone calls from people complaining that doctors are going to be pushed into dead end jobs in the public hospital system. Part of the package is actually at last sitting down and looking at career pathways for salaried medical positions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tenthly, there is a fresh commitment to develop alternative medical training pathways through the review of GP training and by giving the new medical training review panel the roles of dealing with complaints about training and training access and advising the minister on issues relating to alternative training pathways.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In short, I believe this package makes this legislation fairer, much more accountable to us and at the same time creates the potential for getting 250 more doctors into regional and rural Australia. We will be debating these two bills separately in committee so I ask that my speech on the National Health (Budget Measures) Amendment Bill 1996 be incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">National Health (Budget Measures) Amendment Bill 1996</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Second reading speech</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Democrats are opposed to the central provisions of this legislation&mdash;those measures contained in Schedule 1 of the bill which seek to increase the cost of pharmaceuticals for both <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7591"> concessional beneficiaries and general patients under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats have a long record of opposition to increased charges in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1990 we opposed the introduction of a PBS co-payment for pensioners and concessional beneficiaries by the previous Labor Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1993, we opposed the ending&mdash;also by the Labor Government&mdash;of access to free pharmaceuticals beyond the safety net for general patients.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1995, we opposed the increases in the safety net threshold for general patients&mdash;also an initiative by the previous Labor Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That's three times in five years the Labor Government moved to increase pharmaceutical costs. So I have some sympathy with the Coalition Government when it calls the Opposition's approach to this current increase "opportunistic".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When it was a Labor Government hiking the prescription charge for pensioners up from nothing to $2.70 over five years, that was "a price signal". When it's a Coalition Government wanting a 50 cent increase, that's suddenly "unfair" (to use the Shadow Minister's word).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At least the Democrats have been consistent in our opposition to what is really a failure by both the previous Labor Government and the current Coalition Government look beyond the demand side of the equation when it comes to reining in costs under the PBS.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When governments look around to find budget savings, the PBS co-payments and safety net thresholds are always the first cabs off the rank. No-one wants to get serious about wider reform of the PBS. No-one wants to look to the longer term. No-one wants to talk about what sorts of outcomes in pharmaceutical use are desirable. It is obviously much easier to simply ratchet up the safety net thresholds and the co-payments than it is to tackle some of the more entrenched problems within the PBS.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats have been saying for years that Commonwealth outlays under the PBS can and should be reduced. However, we believe attempts to reduce outlays should focus on the supply side of the scheme, rather than on measures which achieve nothing other than shifting the costs back onto those consumers who can least afford to bear them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is interesting that, despite these measures, Commonwealth expenditure under the PBS continues to rise. What is more, the trend in PBS utilisation by concessional beneficiaries also continues to move upwards (despite a drop in demand following the introduction of the co-payment in 1990). <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These trends suggest that `price signals' and co-payments will ultimately fail to deliver the sorts of long-term savings understandably sought by the Government. They also suggest that the real causes of growth in the PBS may lie on the supply side of the scheme and be driven, not by patients, but by doctors and pharmaceutical companies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For some time now, most recently in our dissenting report to the Senate Community Affairs Committee's examination of this legislation, the Democrats have been saying that the Commonwealth Government needs to look at full range of factors influencing grow in PBS outlays.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Factors which include:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"> the role of doctors (particularly general practitioners) in the dispensing of drugs;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"> the role of pharmacists;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the role of promotional advertising within the pharmaceutical industry;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the high volume&mdash;and growth in volume&mdash;of certain pharmaceuticals routinely prescribed under the PBS which are also available over the counter (including paracetamol and aspirin);</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">a general lack of consumer awareness about pharmaceuticals and limited access to independent medications information;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">limited specialised medical knowledge about geriatric prescribing and alternative forms of therapy; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">a general imbalance in health policies, which continue to emphasise remedial therapies instead of preventive health services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Democrats' view, these are areas which the Commonwealth needs to address instead of&mdash;year after year, government after government&mdash;simply throwing in the "too-hard" basket.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe there are much bigger savings to be made by exploring some of these factors. That is the reason the Democrats' dissenting report on this legislation urges the Government to take three actions over the next twelve months&mdash;and I would very much like to hear the Minister's responses to these recommendations some time during this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our first recommendation is that the Government convene a national PBS summit involving all PBS stakeholders with a view to moving towards a National Medicines (or Pharmaceuticals) Policy and obtaining agreement on measures designed to reduce Commonwealth PBS outlays.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think such a summit is long overdue. I know the Minister sits down on a fairly regular basis with some of the key players and I know these issues are discussed at Ministerial level with the States. But the obvious benefit of a summit is that it would <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7592"> bring all players together and enable a full canvassing of concerns about the PBS.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would also provide an opportunity to look at possible savings not in the isolation of a Budgetary context, but in conjunction with desirable outcomes in the consumption and prescribing of pharmaceuticals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats' second recommendation is that the Government, in conjunction with the Royal Australian College of GPs and the AMA, establish two pilot projects designed to change GP prescribing practices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have called these suggested projects the Second (or Lifestyle) Script project and the Pharmaceutical Budgetholding project.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Second Script project would encourage GPs to use two prescription pads: their usual pharmaceutical script and a `lifestyle' script. The lifestyle script is designed to encourage patients, where appropriate, to change lifestyle habits which are damaging to their health.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also designed to encourage GPs to look beyond medication when treating their patients and to consider making specific "lifestyle prescriptions" as an alternative to prescribing pharmaceuticals. Examples of `lifestyle prescriptions' include: reducing caffeine or alcohol intake, getting more exercise (such as walking for a specific amount of time or distance each day), changing dietary habits, stress reduction and relaxation practices, and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Pharmaceutical Budgetholding project would provide GPs with a specific allocation of PBS funds from which they would meet their practices prescription needs over a set period of time. It is designed to encourage GPs to pay less attention to pharmaceutical industry advertising, to take some personal responsibility for the costs of their prescribing practices, to consider less costly medication options and to explore alternatives beyond the prescribing of pharmaceuticals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am not saying either of these projects is the solution to problems with the PBS. But I believe they are the type of project we should be looking at if we are serious about getting GPs to look closely and critically at their own prescribing practices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats' final suggestion is that the Government act on the recommendation contained in the Electronic Prescribing and Medicines Information Consultancy that the Department of Health and Family Services "establish a primary goal of introducing a basic Clinical Workbench to 50 per cent of Australian Office-based Practices (where the prescriber predominantly works from one location) within two years".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Electronic Prescribing and Medicines Information Consultancy report is the result of a 1995 <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> study carried out by the IBM Consulting Group into "the optimal use of technology in the support of Electronic Prescribing and the provision of electronic medicines information".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Final Report of that study makes very interesting reading. It makes the observation that Australia presently lags behind the rest of the advanced world in the use of computers to support clinical practice. The study found that "the combination of Computer Assisted Medication Management and Electronic Prescribing has the potential to improve the quality of health care service delivery significantly and to reduce the number of acute hospital bed days consumed due to medication error".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But, aside from those positive health outcomes, it also found that the implementation of such measures could save the Government around $145 million per annum from the national health budget. Through networking and access to additional information, such measures also offer the potential to further reduce PBS outlays by promoting alternative prescribing practices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In short, we are talking about potentially very big savings here&mdash;and it is these sorts of measures which offer the Government the possibility of reining-in PBS outlays over the medium to long term, rather than plugging along with so-called `price signals' in an area in which demand is essentially inelastic and largely unrelated to price.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measures in this Bill do bite hard. They do hit pensioners and they do hit&mdash;yet again&mdash;families where one or more member has a chronic illness or a disability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We know all the arguments about the Budget bottom line&mdash;but the Democrats stand by our position that, with more than $11 billion worth of Budget measures already passed, deficit reduction is well under control. We do not see why pensioners and people with a disability or illness should have to pay the costs of even faster deficit reduction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Surely we are entitled to make a decision&mdash;as a nation&mdash;that we will opt for a slightly slower deficit reduction program rather than making these people pay more for their pharmaceuticals .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are&mdash;I believe&mdash;even more entitled to make that decision when this Government (like its predecessor) continues to refuse to look to the supply side of the PBS to generate the savings it says it needs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, the Democrats will support the other two measures contained in this Bill: the changes to indexation rules for the PBS co-payments and the restricting of pharmaceutical benefits to Australian citizens, permanent residents and visitors to Australia from countries with which we have reciprocal health care agreements. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7593"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new indexation rules mean that instead of indexing the co-payments for inflation by rounding down to the nearest 10 cents, the co-payments will now be rounded `to the nearest multiple of 10 cents'&mdash;that is rounded up or down. This is a formula which is in wide usage. It is the same formula which is currently used in the Social Security Act. As such, the co-payment will rise or fall along with the pension, for example and that seems to us to be a consistent and acceptable approach.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> It is a decision of the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge). I will tell the Senate why he has come to this decision. It is not for the good of the doctors in training; it is not for the good of the resident medical officers; it is not for the good of rural practice in this country; it is not for the good of potential patients&mdash;and there are 18 million of us; it is to service the need of this government to meet a budget target, its so-called black hole.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To achieve this saved revenue, they have had to cut across the career path of many medical students and RMOs in Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I went to high school in Blacktown, briefly. I spent most of my early years in rural New South Wales and I practised medicine in rural Tasmania as well. It is not acceptable for those opposite, in the interests of a fiscal imperative, to say to other people, `You must leave your family, you must leave your neighbourhood, you must leave the environment you have worked for and go and work where we tell you or have no job.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the outcome of this arrangement. That is what is facing hundreds of young doctors in the future in this country. It is totally unfair; it will lead to totally unnecessary hardship; and, at the end of the day, it will deprive the country of the available allocation of doctors who could be working in the medical service for the wider populace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will conclude by referring to the college system which Senator Lees spoke about. It is high time there was an independent arbiter on medical training and the direction the medical job placements will go in this country. The colleges, like the old guilds, have a vested interest. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners did not exist when I graduated but it has gone through the ranks to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> become one of the most powerful and self-interested organisations in the country. No doubt it is in both the college's interest and the interests of its established members to restrict the numbers of other people going into its ranks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You do not have to be Einstein to know that it is going to be to the benefit&mdash;both financially and career wise&mdash;of those doctors who have already made it, to squeeze out those who have not. That is what is happening with this legislation. Those doctors who have made it will be okay; those who have not made it will be left to the vagaries of a new system, where they have to compete with each other and accept a whole new bundle of conditions which did not exist when they entered medical school, or get no job at all at the end of the day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> We can do better than that. We ought to be working through incentives to ensure that medical expertise is available in rural areas around this country. We ought to be ensuring&mdash;at a baseline though&mdash;that everybody who goes into our medical schools, who gives up their lives to get through the long training that is required, who takes a lot of money out of the public purse in doing so, is placed in a job in the profession where they are happy, they are productive and they are contributing to society in the way they intended to when they entered medical school. This legislation is the first removal of the plank in that ideal.</PARA></SPEECH>

<STATE> (Victoria)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(8.09 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This legislation is quite unfair. It is retrospective in a couple of respects. The first is that it denies a reasonable expectation for those people who have begun a course, who are now halfway through a course or who have finished a course. They began that course with the reasonable expectation that, at the end of carrying out certain studies, they would be entitled to treat patients and those patients would be entitled to recover fees under the Medicare provisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That has been changed at a late hour. Those people who have recently graduated and those people who are now doing internships have been sacrificed&mdash;I use the word advisedly&mdash;for fiscal purposes. If this was all about merit, then there might be some justification. But it <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7595"> is not about merit. That is quite clear from the proposed section 19CC which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A medical practitioner, or a person acting on behalf of the medical practitioner, is guilty of an offence . . . </PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>What offence is such a person going to be guilty of? For bad treatment because he or she treats a patient when he or she is not as qualified as this particular piece of legislation would like to see him or her qualified? No, it is not that. The only reason he or she can be penalised is that, before he or she rendered a service, he or she did not take such steps as are reasonable in all the circumstances to inform the other person that a Medicare benefit would not be paid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I just ask the minister: why is it all right for a doctor to treat a patient, to give all sorts of treatment and that is not punishable, but it is punishable if they fail to tell the person that that person cannot recover a Medicare benefit?</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="WOODS" NAMEID="1K4">

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SF4">Senator COONEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is your legislation. That is the legislation that the Democrats support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cut-off date is simply an arbitrary date of 1 November. There seems to be no rhyme nor reason why 1 November 1996 should be plucked out of the air as a means of rendering people unable to claim Medicare benefits because a particular doctor has treated them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I could have understood it if you said, `We're going to have a system which puts doctors to the test and anybody who is not now worthy of being a doctor will no longer be able to practise.' But that is not what you have said. You have said, `Anybody who is a doctor already, anybody who has got up the ladder already, can practise for as long as he or she likes.' That is not the point. The amount of merit they have in their service does not matter. All that matters is when you qualified. That is the only thing that matters in this scheme. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is not about merit; it is about when a particular person happened to go through a course. That is why it is safe to say that these are budgetary <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> measures and nothing else. That is the first thing. It throws the burden of fiscal management on the particularly vulnerable&mdash;the young students who have studied for years with a particular belief which was well justified&mdash;at the last minute because the government wants to save money. The government is entitled to save money. But what should not be done is to heap upon the shoulders of these young students the proposition that they are making the sacrifice because people want them to be better doctors. It is not about that at all; it is about saving money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Another illustration is the discussion we have had about people going to rural areas. Following on from what Senator Lees was putting, the proposition would seem to be that more doctors should go to the rural areas and that this is an incentive for them to do that. Indeed, it cannot be denied that there is a pressure on them to do that. If that is so, I ask the minister: isn't that conscription within the meaning of the law, within the meaning of what the High Court has said?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The parliamentary secretary shakes his head, but I think he will find, if he checks, that the issue of whether or not this is conscription is to be decided according to the facts and not according to law as written. I think he will find that is right. The sort of language that is being used in the speeches so far from the Democrats in particular indicates that this is, at least in part, about sending people to the country. That is a good thing, but I think you might have some problems with the constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last thing I want to talk about is the professionalism of medicine. This is an act which attacks the idea of the medical profession because it takes the regulation that controls the profession out of the profession's hands and puts it into the hands of the government. If the parliamentary secretary to the minister doubts that, I invite him to look at the various subsections, including schedule 1, items 1, 2, 4, 6, 7 and various parts of 10, and give comments. I think that will do for the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposition I want to put to you is that the qualifications that people are obliged to obtain, and their ability to go on in their <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7596"> profession or otherwise, depend not on what their peers say&mdash;not on what the colleges say&mdash;but on what is set out in the regulations. The regulations are made by the Governor&hyphen;General, which means the government. The way the regulations are going to be used under this legislation will mean that the government rather than the profession will be running medicine from now on.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In speaking to this bill I would like to first speak about the Gap Issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This measure will increase the maximum gap between the Schedule fee and the Medicare rebate for any out&hyphen;of&hyphen;hospital services to $50.00 (indexed annually).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As my colleagues stated in the report on this bill this is a fundamental breach of the coalition's election promise to "maintain Medicare in its entirety".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This measure challenges the objectives of Medicare. As we know Medicare provides one of the fairest systems in the world with more than 2 million Australians being protected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This measure, like the attack on the unemployed under the Social Security Budget Bills is an attack on a vulnerable group whose only distinguishing characteristic in this case is that they require high&hyphen;cost medical treatment done outside the hospital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">People for example who are suffering from chronic diseases such as cancer or coronary artery disease will be candidates for an increase in fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was some discussion in the hearing into this Bill about the safety net. An interesting point was raised in acknowledging that the safety net remains&mdash;that there would be many chronically ill patients who in this category will end up requiring investigations each year for a couple or few years. In those cases where they are not bulk billed, they will be faced with the impost of $271 out of pockets each year as a direct result of this measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is treatment that these people cannot avoid such as CT scans, nuclear medicine procedures and angiography.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Royal Australasian College of Radiologists said and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Many of these patients are old, very ill, and some of them have multiple examinations." <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">At no stage was this "gap issue" measure discussed with these patients or consumer groups let alone the doctors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Royal Australasian College of Radiologists feel rightly betrayed. They had cooperated fully with the Minister and Department to produce a comprehensive package addressing the growth in diagnostic imaging expenditure under Medicare. Then with no inkling provided during that period of cooperation this measure was introduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is no wonder they oppose it. It is no wonder also that the trusting relationship between radiologists and physicians and the Department has been damaged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We therefore oppose those parts of the Bill which give effect to the increase in the maximum permissible gap payment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As to the work force issues of provider numbers and post graduate numbers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the retrospectivity of this measure that so upsets me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Current medical students and interns rightly in my view, expected a number of important constants to remain in place for the duration of their study and training when they embarked on their careers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the most important constants would be what would happen to them when they completed their internship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">To cause that constant to be varied is sacrilege.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As Doctors&hyphen;in&hyphen;Training stated in their submission and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Many of this year's graduates, and latter year medical students have based their plans for their future around the assumption that all career options previously available would still be present on completion of their intern year".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a disgrace in my view that these students have to bare the brunt of this measure when other options are available which could be phased in over a longer period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another important issue is what now holds for the future for female graduates and women doctors in training and the availability of training places because of this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I cannot agree with the Chairman of the Community Affairs Legislation Community Affairs Committee, Senator Sue Knowles when she stated in her Media Release and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">". . . fairness and gender equity in post&hyphen;graduate training have always been of concern but are not directly related to this measure".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe that statement to be a cop out and a little rich when you take into account the retrospectivity of this measure. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7597"> </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What opportunism and hypocrisy from the Labor Party in approaching a very sensible bill which introduces a lot of very sensible measures which will preserve Medicare, something I thought the Labor Party pretended to be in support of.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me just address some of the issues raised by Senator Neal. Let me point out a few things about the Labor Party and its approach to the pharmaceutical benefits system. Senator Neal is complaining that we are `slashing' and forcing those who cannot afford it to pay enormous amounts of salaries. Under Labor, from 1983 to 1996, the general payments in pharmaceutical benefits co&hyphen;payments increased by 420 per cent. The concessional payments in the same period increased by 74 per cent. In 1986, you had a one&hyphen;off increase of $5. In 1990, you had a one&hyphen;off increase of $4. This is all separate from the indexation linkages. The average yearly increase in patient charges under you was 17.75 per cent. How can you actually stand there with a straight face and pretend that you really care about this?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me just run quickly through what this will do. The small amendments in terms of the increase in co&hyphen;payments mean for general beneficiaries, who have an average of 1.6 prescriptions a year, that the average extra cost per person per year will be $4.24. You are sitting there with your crocodile tears and bleeding hearts trying to pretend that this is really going to break the bank of those poor people. For goodness sake, wake up to real life. Look at the people who you are claiming are really going to be up against it because of this measure. The average use per concession card holder is 17 scripts a year. The average cost therefore will be $8.76 extra per year.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1K4">Senator WOODS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are facts. You might not like the facts, Senator Neal, but they are the facts: 16c per week. If you look at the most vulnerable group, as you claim, the average use per elderly concession is 30 scripts. That means an average of $15 a year for the most vulnerable group. For goodness sake, $15 a year! I do not know how you can stand there with a straight face and say that we are ripping those people off; that we are attacking them and undermining the whole fabric of society. Bear in mind that we maintain in script terms the same safety net as we had before. I do not understand how you can stand there with a straight face and pretend to be protecting the poor and disadvantaged when what we are doing here is something which is necessary and essential.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We want a pharmaceutical benefits scheme that works. Under the Labor Party, I think the figures are that over the last four years the cost of the PBS has doubled. You may think that is maintainable but the fact is it is not. If you want to do that, the only way of actually maintaining it is to cut drugs off the PBS or, worse perhaps, not allow new drugs to go onto the PBS. What you finished up with with your system is a PBS which basically does not offer any worthwhile pharmaceuticals and which removes from people who need them the medications on which they depend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you want to have a maintainable system, you have to be sensible and realistic. The extra costs for individuals are minimal, as I pointed out, and the benefits to the system are very real indeed. There is not an infinite health budget. It is finite. There is a limit to what we can spend on health in terms of pharmaceuticals and medical benefits&mdash;and indeed other issues. In this regard, this is a way of making the system viable. If we did not do this, if we did not undertake these measures, I think the expectations are that the cost of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, which is already $2.6 billion per year, would increase rapidly again under the plans which you had.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because we are running out of time, I will address briefly some of the other issues. I <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7598"> think Senator Lees actually pointed out some of the salient facts here. There were some attempts by Senator Brown to try to justify his support for the opposition to this bill on the grounds of things like: `It is the graduate's rightful place.' I am not quite sure what that means. I would have thought the most important thing is what happens to the Australian community and indeed the community as patients of those doctors. He claimed that it was not for the good of the residents themselves, not for the good of rural dwellers, not for the good of 18 million patients but it was simply for the good of the debt, the black hole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say right away: yes, there is a benefit here in terms of the black hole because there is a major financial problem which is largely supply driven. That basically means that there are too many doctors. There are not many people around Australia who argue with the fact that there are too many doctors, and this is an appropriate way of addressing that issue: to make sure that those doctors are practising in the right place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Contrary to what Senator Cooney said, who claimed that there was no basis in merit on this issue, there is enormous benefit in this. What we are saying is exactly what the GP strategy under your government, the ALP government said, Senator Cooney. I can actually quote the 1992 document which said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AMA, the College of General Practitioners and the government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is your government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">support the principle that GPs should complete appropriate postgraduate training as signified by the FRACGP.</PARA>
<PARA>I am quoting your own government's comments. Now, of course, a couple of years later, it has all changed. Or Jenny Macklin, that independent reviewer of the health system who happens now to be a Labor member, said in her strategy paper:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is widespread agreement on the need for vocational training to produce doctors with general practice skills. General practice should not be a dumping ground for people who cannot practise anywhere else or who cannot be bothered to get extra training. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>The leader of the Deans of the Australian Medical Schools, Professor John Young, says the same thing. There is no question that this is a matter of merit. It is also a matter of blocking an unlimited supply. The cost of each new graduate in GPs is something like $200,000 a year because of not only the medical fees they generate but the fees they generate from radiology referrals, pathology referrals and a whole range of other referrals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there is a budgetary component. But the bottom line is that we will finish up with a better quality of doctor&mdash;and not an undifferentiated graduate but somebody with appropriate training who will actually supply a better quality of care to our patients. Indeed, there are encouragements and inducements for people to practise in rural areas. That is something that the Democrats have been very keen on pushing&mdash;and I congratulate them on that. It is also something which is very sensible, and we can address the details of what is going on in that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, essentially, this is about merit, about extra training, about quality of medicine. It also does address some of the budget issues, which is so crucial. If we want to maintain Medicare we have to make sure there is an appropriate budgetary constraint which allows it to be viable, because an uncontrolled Medicare blow&hyphen;out would essentially undermine the principles of Medicare. That is something which I think nobody in this chamber seriously wants.</PARA>

It is not the intention of the opposition to have an extraordinarily drawn out process with a massive number of divisions. In order to avoid that occurring, if the opposition does not call a division for a matter where there is not adequate support, the only way we can deal with that is by indicating why that is the case. Obviously there are a number of crucial votes, particularly in relation to the Independent and minor party senators in the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will try to assist the committee by seeing whether, on behalf of the opposition, I can obviate the need for calling divisions if there is clarity about the way that Independent and minor party senators are voting. I think that would be of assistance. It will save time. I will do my best in that regard. It may not be possible but if it is clear, in relation perhaps even to your vote, Mr Chairman, which is obviously significant in this matter, we will do our best to move it along quickly.</PARA></INTERJECT>

Given that you, Mr Chairman, have made the ruling, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> after we had left the chamber at the conclusion of the debate before the amendments had been put to the chamber, as you correctly indicate, I in fact asked my staff to go to the sub&hyphen;Table Office and ask for a full copy of all government amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There certainly has been a decline in spending on hospitals. I would suggest that the $800 million that this government has cut out of hospitals in this budget has probably got something to do with it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the proposal that is before us, I want to clarify a number of issues that were raised by the parliamentary secretary where he misrepresented the position that I put in the second reading debate. The parliamentary secretary seemed to make a statement that we were opposed to the training of GPs. I have to say very clearly and very strongly that that is not the case. We are very supportive of the general concept of training in all the professions&mdash;particularly in the area of general practice in medicine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are concerned about is not the issue of providing training at all but the issue of fairness and the implementation and how this is being done retrospectively. We believe that the main purpose of this legislation that the government is putting into place is not to enhance the standards of general practice but to place a gate to reduce the number of general practitioners using Medicare.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not inherently bad in itself. We are well aware that during the time that we were in government this was an issue that Labor health ministers grappled with and tried to bring about. But the real question is whether it is fair to put a gate in seven years after someone has commenced a medical degree or whether it would be fairer to put the gate in before they ever commenced. That is very strongly our view&mdash;that it is unfair to put a gate in after someone has undertaken six years of a medical degree and one year of internship and, in some cases, even more time than that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation that is created is that the medical graduates themselves expend a lot of time, effort and money in gaining this training. Not only that but also, through our <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7655"> university system, where we provide a portion of money in training, public money is being wasted training doctors who will not get through the gate which you put in seven years on&mdash;not only seven years on but also retrospectively.</PARA></SPEECH>

You really cannot say the $800 million, which does not exist in reality but even if it did exist would not have existed until next year, can have affected the expenditure from three years ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to the question about whether you want people to be trained or not. The facts of the matter belie what you are saying. You are saying that you want people to be able to go straight out of internship into the wider community and set up a shingle as a GP even though they are not trained. You are saying you want them to be trained, but what you are promoting is the ability of these people to set up and be funded by the taxpayer when they are not trained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> We are saying quite the opposite. We are saying that we do not think they should go out there and set up a shingle as a GP until they are properly trained and have had the appropriate experience and vocational training or whatever the training might be. So the facts of the matter belie what you are saying. It is a nice airy-fairy principle, but the reality is that we are saying we want the public to be treated by doctors who are trained appropri ately and we are going to make sure that is the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You said that your respective ministers of health `grappled' with the supply side. I think that is probably an appropriate word. You did just grapple; you never came to terms with it and you never did anything about it. When you make the reference that money is wasted on training doctors&mdash;and I do not think anybody is exactly sure how much it costs&mdash;you wave the figure of $130,000 around. If that money is invested on doctors, that is fine. But if you think that is a waste in some way, are you going to compound that by saying that they can then go out into the community and consume on their supply induced expenditure something close to $200,000 per year per doctor in general practice?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is something about quitting while you are ahead. Just looking at the economics of it, not the rights and wrongs of the training or quality of training, the money is not wasted. You talked about the expectations of people who have been training for seven years. It is usually a bit shorter than that, but never mind. I am not sure that that is not a very elitist point of view. There are lots of people who go through a lot of training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not saying that they cannot practise medicine. We are saying that it may not be possible for them to practise medicine in a general practice in the middle of Sydney without further training. We are saying they need more training. We are saying that we cannot necessarily have the complete freedom of choice of free slather that they had under your government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our point of view, and I think the Democrats support this, is that there will be a position for all those people who want it to be able to go into practice. We are not saying that you cannot get through that gate. We are saying, `When you get through the gate, you may not be able to go up to the yellow brick road.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Neal has just confirmed exactly what I was saying: you may not be able to choose that particular type of medical practice to have a provider number, to set up a shingle and to practise as a GP in the middle of one of the major cities. We are saying that there will be an ability to practise medicine. It may be in a hospital or in a range of other options, and there will be training places for virtually every single doctor who wants it. But it may be that they cannot choose the most lucrative or most attractive option. The better ones will be able to, and there will be an element of competition there.

I also find that your arguments, Senator Woods, are straining credulity. You are doing very well, jumpin' from left foot to right foot, duckin' and twistin' and weavin'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish we had on the record what you thought when we were actually discussing the introduction of vocational registration at all. It would have been very nice if we could have come back here today with some of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> quotes of when you vilified and pilloried this government for even contemplating the idea that a graduate with one year's internship should be encouraged to do vocational registration at all before they should have the option of two tiers of fees, depending effectively on whether they had participated in vocational registration or not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7657"> But your arguments to Senator Neal a minute ago were deliberately misunderstanding and misrepresenting her. When she talked about a person training for six or seven years, there's not much mileage in making petty points about whether it is six or seven, Senator. It is six or seven until we get into the four years undergraduate and four years post graduate. If you want to nitpick like that at this stage of the night, do not think it does you much credit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, if doctors finish six or seven years of training and then discover that there is not a course place in postgraduate general practice training and the options for them are very few or that there are options that they had not planned to participate in, I ask you to consider, Senator, what your attitude would be if we were introducing this legislation. You would be over the top, foaming at the mouth and carrying on. What you have to face up to is the fact that you are actually committing a dreadful error here&mdash;it is worse than an error; I would regard it as almost a crime but certainly it is an appalling piece of legislation&mdash;because it is introducing a retrospective effect of effectively six years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you came in here and said, `This government is intent on doing this, on seeing a restriction on the number of doctors who can just walk out and automatically start practising and we are going to give three years notice,' I think a lot of people would have said that that was reasonable. It is rough. It is rough for people who have started down three years of a course, but for people who have finished it is a disgrace. I would like to see you take on the legal profession in the same way. I would like you to take on anybody else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, Senator, you can remind us if you like what you anticipate the savings will be on this. But if out of one side of your mouth you are saying there are some savings because the costs are huge and out of the other side you are saying that there are really going to be no doctors affected, there are going to be a lot of jobs for them, then I do not know how you can hold both of those and tie both of your shoes straight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing too, Senator, is that Senator Neal is right: if somebody trains for six years at the cost you estimate of around $130,000 and then cannot proceed to practise medicine, particularly the medicine that they choose to&mdash;some doctors will not want to, Senator&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As this was a major part of our proposal, one of my major interests was to make sure that we really did tackle the issue of doctors into rural areas a little more seriously than it has been done in the past. With all the efforts that are going on to date, we have less than a one per cent increase. We are barely holding the line. Yes, we are encouraging a few more doctors out there, but they are retiring and moving back at almost the same rate as we are encouraging them out there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But for Senator West to somehow expect we could wave a magic wand and get adequately trained doctors out into rural areas overnight is ridiculous. It would mean some sort of conscription. Are you advocating, Senator West, that we allocate Medicare provider numbers by location? There is no short cut. If we are going to get doctors out there, it is going to take time. I have been arguing that we need to do more than we are doing at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a range of measures in this bill. The 250 additional rural places are only at the bottom of the safety net. I would just like to go through a couple of the other proposals. One of them has nothing to do with us. It was already in the package and it was a good reason to, indeed, support what the minister was doing in order to get those clinical assistantships, because they are a way of short&hyphen;circuiting yourself into the college of general practice if you will agree&mdash;we are talking about newly registered doctors&mdash;to go out into a rural hospital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are other avenues such as Aboriginal medical services. They are supervised, pre&hyphen;training positions which would count towards the requirement of the RACGP training program. Provided that these doctors meet the RACGP's minimum standards, doctors working as clinical assistants would be guaranteed entry to the training program after a minimum of one and a maximum of four years if a place had not been obtained sooner. In other words, it is helping those people who are either deciding to wait a year or very keen to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> get into the RACGP training program. They can go and spend that time out there in a rural area and it gives them that additional boost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have an undertaking with the minister to go back again to the RACGP to keep negotiating. They already have, as of 1 July 1995, a requirement that all their trainees undertake a period of training either in the country or another area of need. We are arguing that we can tighten that up and increase the percentage of places within the 400 quota. I think Senator Neal was at the hearing when we found that they have 900 places but they can fill only 400, of which 60 per cent can be in the city, which means we can basically have no-one out training in the country. We are looking at that equation and that problem with the RACGP to increase the percentage of places for training in rural areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, the deans of the medical faculties around the country are already required to provide a small amount of time in the country. We have asked that that be increased and that they use every opportunity right throughout those five or six years in university to get some experience out in a rural area&mdash;in other words, rather than ending up at Flinders, they go down to Victor Harbour or perhaps out to Murray Bridge for a couple of weeks during their university time.</PARA>

Part of the package we have negotiated with government is that we look at reforms for the RMOs and salaried medical practitioners. Part of the trouble of getting people into hospitals has been that they hit a brick wall. After those three or four years of making up their minds, they really have to go back to square 1. We need a better range of training opportunities and pathways through the public hospital system, and different pathways to be a GP rather than just the RACGP training program.

We can argue about the cuts, but nobody in the legal profession can hang up a shingle and become one of the leading trial lawyers until they actually have the extra training and extra experience. We are saying exactly the same thing here: you need the training and you need the experience.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a discrepancy between what Senator West was saying and what Senator Neal was saying. On the one hand, Senator Neal was saying that she supported adequate training; on the other hand, Senator West was almost saying, `How dare you send undertrained people out into the bush.' Yet Senator Neal is saying you can because they are actually trained okay. There is a bit of a chasm between those two views: either you are going to have trained doctors or you are not going to have trained doctors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I think Senator Lees pointed out, we are not talking about unpaid training&mdash;we are not talking about students on Austudy&mdash;we are talking by and large about doctors who, after their intern year, are earning $50,000, $60,000 or $70,000 a year. Most of our society would be very happy to be earning that while they are training. It is not as though we are actually putting them on the breadline. It is not as though they are going to be stricken with poverty. They are earning quite a good income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at Senator Eggleston's incorporated speech, I think you will find that the average time between qualifying and actually going out into the big wide world as a medical practitioner is some 3&half; years. I stand to be corrected on that but in general terms that is right. One of the points Senator Eggleston was making was that, in some regards, it is what already happens in the real world.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are saying a number of things. Firstly, you should not be able to go out and practice by yourself unsupervised and without the appropriate training. Indeed you should not also be an extra burden&mdash;which is getting towards $200,000 a year&mdash;upon the taxpayer. We are talking about not so much the question of whether you can move into the area of practice; we are talking about what sort of practice you can do. Can you go out and set up a shingle, be a GP and be a burden on the taxpayer with supply-driven demands, which are very high indeed, or should you go through the training. We are saying that you should go through the training. It is better for quality and it is better for economics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Turning to what Senator Cooney was saying, it is quite difficult to stop a qualified medical practitioner from practising. We as a Commonwealth have no powers to do that. We are saying that they should be under some sort of supervision or some sort of training. We are ensuring that there will be a range of programs which will mean that virtually everybody who wants to undergo further training will be able to get that. I am not aware of any powers that we have which could stop a doctor from practising. Sure, we are making it difficult for them to practice by themselves, and that is entirely appropriate. We are pressuring them, if you like, into undergoing appropriate training and experience gathering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In regard to the question of the penalty being on not informing patients that they are not going to get a Medicare rebate, I thought this was something you were greatly in favour of. In terms of Carmen Lawrence's legislation when she was health minister, I thought you were urging us to make sure that patients knew exactly what they were up for. We are doing exactly the same thing.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If that is the case, then Carmen Lawrence, the previous health minister, was also guilty of conscription. Of course it is not conscription. What we are saying is, in general principles, what you have been saying; that is, the patient should know what they are up for. If they are not going to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7661"> get a rebate, they should know that in advance. If they are going to be faced with a bill which they cannot get any rebate on, we believe they should know. I thought everybody in this chamber supported the proposition of giving patients as much information about what they are likely to be up for as they possibly can. I am surprised there is any question about it.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will flex our muscles. In country areas there is a shortage of medical practitioners. It is quite possible that the clinical assistant&hyphen;ships will go some way to overcoming this shortage, but they do require supervision. The places which are short of doctors that I can think of in rural New South Wales are small communities where I do not think the current GPs are in a position to take on any additional supervisory load. That to me is of great concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am flagging to the parliamentary secretary the issues that I think are of concern. I am sorry that Senator Eggleston had to go back to Western Australia for the election tomorrow, because we would have been able to have had a very constructive discussion with his being a doctor who has worked in rural areas and in isolation.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a sort of dichotomy I cannot quite understand and comprehend. We hear that it should be compulsory to have six months or even 12 months either in rural health or Aboriginal health out of the capital cities, but we also hear the call for cognisance to be taken of the needs of females who will be undertaking this training, especially those with small families. They will not have the capacity to move out of the capital cities, or wherever their spouse is located, for six months. I am just not sure there is going to be enough flexibility built into this training to accommodate the needs of these people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do recognise that the needs of women in receiving additional training in colleges for doctors are not being addressed. There is inadequate part-time training offered. The glass ceilings there have been well identified. I am flagging a possible barrier for women in that this proposal will disadvantage them. I do not want that to happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, I do not know that they will have the support there for supervision in small country areas. I do not even know whether there would be enough accommodation, somewhere for them to live, in these small towns. These are all issues that have to be addressed. I am not disagreeing with clinical assistant&hyphen;ships necessarily but I am saying that there are problems which I do not think you have addressed. They are good sounding words, but I do not see how it is going to work. You have not put enough thought into it. I just flag those concerns to you.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows:</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">PATIENT ACCESS TO MEDICAL RECORDS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule 4&mdash;Amendments relating to patient access to medical records. (Amendment to the Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill aims to address the consumer and consumer group concern about patient access to medical records.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the UK, Canada, New Zealand and in most states in the United States, people have a right to gain access to their own medical records.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the moment, patients can get access to records held by public authorities through Commonwealth and State Freedom of Information Legislation. Medical records held by private practitioners can also be subpoenaed or compulsorily disclosed through the process of discovery in a court of law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The limitation, as shown in the recent High Court decision of Breen v Williams, is that proceedings must have already commenced. Records could not be obtained before proceedings were underway.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under present legislation NSW patients treated in private hospitals, day procedure centres and residents of nursing homes can make a written request to the organisation for access to their health records.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As soon as possible the organisation must make the medical record available for the patient or a representative to inspect. Access can only be denied if it would harm the patient's physical or mental health.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The patient must be given help with the interpretation of test results, for example, and where the patient disagrees with the information their comments must be attached to the record on request.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A patient can appeal to the Director-General of the Health Department if the patient is refused access to their medical records.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NSW legislation and the UK model is similar to the model I propose both in intent and style.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment I move today seeks to extend current access and to make it a uniform and legislated right. It is the minimalist position. It seeks to incorporate doctors concerns while covering most medical professionals not already covered and most patients.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are much more complicated routes that can be taken, which will be confusing to consumers and complicated for health organisations and doctors to administer. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7664"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many people may not want to read their own medical records but few people realise they don't have a right to see information which is kept on their health by doctors and other medical professionals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most people would think they were able to view their files just as they are entitled to see a file held on them by the Department of Social Security, for example.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are many reasons why people want to see their medical files. People may want to be better informed about their health, in which case they will want to discuss their medical records with their current GP.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some patients want to take their current and past medical information to a different doctor, for a second opinion, or because they have moved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Essentially, many people want ownership of the management of their own health. People want to have a greater role in making decisions about their own health care.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not believe there will be, or should be, information contained in a medical record kept on a patient that a patient could or should not view.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be situations, where a patient shouldn't see his or her medical file. This amendment takes that into account.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment provides that where a doctor is of the view, based on reasonable grounds, that access to the records may cause serious physical or mental harm to a person then access can be denied.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has mainly been psychiatrists and other medical professionals working in areas of mental health, that are worried about patients access to medical records.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where a patient will suffer serious mental or physical harm from viewing their record then access can be denied. But even in this situation, a doctor should think carefully. A patient shouldn't be denied the same rights as other people solely on the basis that he or she is suffering a condition that affects mental health.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government often talks about the need for greater competition in the health sector, between doctors, other practitioners, hospitals and health funds for example, but are not prepared to give patients the information they need to make more informed decisions about treatment options.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most fundamental information a patient requires is their own medical history.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Patients are given copies of their x-rays for example, so they can take them to other doctors and will always have information about the injury for future consultations. Patients will generally pay for x&hyphen;rays.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most people think that because medical information is recorded on files about their own health that they <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> must own or have a right of access to that information.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Breen v Williams the court ruled that because doctors recorded the information and a patient didn't pay for the information, as they do for an x-ray, for example, ownership rested with the person compiling the medical record and the doctor could refuse access.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Justice Brennan stated in his judgement that if a patient's health would be jeopardised by not viewing his or her records, then the patient should be given access.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the judgement, it was emphasised that any changes regarding patient access to medical records was a matter for the parliament rather than the courts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Patients also want to be able to correct the information recorded about them on their medical records, or to at least have the file noted that they disagree with a certain piece of information.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Article 17.1 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, ratified by Australia, enshrines a right to privacy. The right to privacy has been interpreted to include the right to have some control over the perceptions of a person contained in his or her medical records.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment will allow a patient to ask for his or her record to be corrected and where a doctor disagrees, to have the record noted with the patient's concern.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Allowing patients access to their medical records will enhance the doctor-patient relationship. It will allow patients to have greater trust in their doctor knowing they are able to view their records.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Doctors and other health professionals are willing to discuss these issue with patients, but there is no right of access for patients to view records that are written about their health.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many doctors already allow patients access to their medical records but this amendment would make it a right.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AMA in its code of conduct, encourages doctors to give patients access to their health records. I applaud this initiative. The point is that this access is entirely at the discretion of the doctor and not a right.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This legislation makes access to a person's medical records a right, enforceable by sanctions that are reasonable but persuasive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To me it states a philosophy that a person's health and life should not be entirely in the hands of all knowing professionals, who whisper behind doors and determine in private what is best for you, the patient.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Health management I believe should be the function of a mutual relationship of trust between us: <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7665"> the patient and the medical worker, each with equal access to information and input into the process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The objective of this amendment is to bring this type of environment about.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I urge you to support the amendment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will be supporting the removal of schedule 1, which is the increase in the PBS, but we will not be supporting your move on schedule 2, which is the rounding factor. If I could just say here, as I did in my incorporated speech at the second reading stage, we believe that the government has a range of other alternatives that they can pursue to rein in the expenditure increases in the PBS. There were two issues which I raised in committee, one relating to a summit and looking at a range of other measures and, in particular, one looking at the two pilot projects. I am wondering whether the minister has an answer on either of those issues. Perhaps, looking at the lateness of the hour, you would like to incorporate your answers because, regardless of where we are going tonight, we cannot support an increase in pharmaceutical charges that hit, yet again, those who are least able to wear those imposts.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7667"> response to Senator Lees's queries, there is a whole range of answers which I am happy to give but, as you point out, the lateness of the hour is somewhat against us. There is a whole range of issues which you have raised here and in other areas. Let me just quickly say that the pharmaceutical education program is focussing very much on this. The role of doctors is being addressed by the HRC, by education programs, by developing consensus guidelines. The role of pharmacists is the subject of many reviews, including the role of the consultant pharmacy, which I think the Democrats would support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At present there is an independent inquiry into the commercial advertising issue. It is being conducted by KPMG. The OTC&mdash;the over the counter&mdash;growth in volume, again is the subject of an inquiry. We agree with you about the lack of consumer awareness. We are emphasising the importance of that, both through the PET program and through improving product information and documentation. Geriatric prescribing has been the subject of a pilot study&mdash;which I think will be expanded&mdash;which addresses a number of issues. I am happy to go through the details with you, perhaps at another time. Perhaps you would like to take my word that the pilot study is very exciting and, I think, will lead to a better quality use of medicines. We agree that there is an imbalance which emphasises remedial therapies, which is one of the reasons why Minister Wooldridge has made such a big emphasis upon the importance of preventative health medicine. We could not agree more with that issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the amendments raised and moved by Senator Neal, we address most of the points, I think, in the second reading speech. One of the points I would like to make is that this is a very important matter in terms of the actual amount which is saved to the PBS, which is then available for better quality medicines. I think the total amount over four years is something like $450 million but the average amount for an ordinary non&hyphen;concessional prescriber will be something like $4 a year. For a concessional card holder it will be something like $15 a year&mdash;that is for the elderly concessional holders&mdash;and for the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> average concessional card holder, about $8 a year. So we are not putting a big imposition on individuals. We are maintaining the quality of the PBS. We will make sure that newer drugs become more available and that the whole system is supported. We believe very strongly in it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to that is that we are maintaining the safety nets in terms of the number of prescriptions each year. We are protecting the individuals. There will be one prescription per week to reach the safety net, as indeed is the case now. In the general area, general beneficiaries last year reached the safety net with 34 scripts. In future, they will need only 30 scripts. So in that regard we are improving the situation. We are still maintaining the safety net protection for those who are chronically sick who need constant prescribing. The maximum that will be paid by the concessional group I think is $26 a year.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 gives legislative effect to the 1996 government budget decision to discontinue the payment of the untargeted operational subsidy to community based long day care centres from 1 July 1997. This bill also gives effect to the 1996 budget decision to apply a reduced rate of entitlement to the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7669"> child-care cash rebate for families on higher incomes while retaining the current rate for families on lower incomes. This change will take effect from 1 April 1997.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also introduces amendments aimed at clarifying eligibility issues and compliance requirements consistent with the intentions of the Commonwealth child-care cash rebate scheme. The removal of operational subsidy is about equity for parents. Operational subsidy is currently paid on a non-means tested basis to community centres which provide around only 30 per cent of all centre based care catering for 70,000 families. Operational subsidy has never been paid to private centres even though they provide 70 per cent of centre based care and cater for more than 220,000 families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The removal of the untargeted operational subsidy from community child-care centres removes a significant inequity in government assistance that currently exists for families using private rather than community based long day care. Inequities exist between the 70,000 families in community based centres receiving operational subsidy, the 220,000 families in private centres not receiving operational subsidy, the 27,000 low income families receiving maximum child-care assistance benefiting from operational subsidy in community centres, the 96,000 families receiving child-care assistance who are in private centres which do not benefit from operational subsidy, the 14,000 babies in community centres receiving operational subsidy and the 26,000 babies in private centres which do not receive operational subsidy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An examination of comparative figures for other areas shows that twice as many children with special needs are in private centres, over twice as many private centres are in rural and remote areas and that the private sector provides double the number of places for children of sole parents compared with the community sector. I know that all those figures will be of surprise to many people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Importantly, all special or high cost services provided by community child-care centres are also provided by the private sector. Perhaps the greatest inequity relates to the 18,000 high <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> income families&mdash;those families earning above the child-care assistance cut&hyphen;offs&mdash;in community centres that benefit from operational subsidy compared to the 96,000 low income families receiving maximum child-care assistance who are in private centres and who do not benefit from operational subsidy. It is inequitable that none of these parents receive the same level of subsidy as parents using community based long day care centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the budget, families have been told by the opposition that, because of the removal of operational subsidy, community based centres will close and/or fees will increase dramatically. I would strongly encourage parents to challenge such claims. The government has set aside $8.3 million over two years to help centres purchase management and financial advice to assist them to increase efficiencies, to reduce costs and to operate without operational subsidy. This $8.3 million is additional to the $11.5 million available over three years to assist centres to upgrade and to amalgamate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will also provide $12.5 million over four years to ensure that families in severely disadvantaged areas maintain access to child care. Such assistance will minimise service closures and the need for fee increases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Claims have also been made that quality of care will fall as a result of this measure. But nothing could be further from the truth. Quality care is best ensured not through operational subsidy but by the quality improvement and accreditation system and state licensing requirements which both private and community based long day care centres are subject to. Eight&hyphen;five per cent of all private services that have completed the quality improvement and accreditation system have achieved the standard necessary to achieve accreditation without the benefit of operational subsidy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is committed to maintaining the accreditation system for child&hyphen;care centres and to extending it to family day care and outside school hours care. Senators Faulkner and Lundy have indicated that services offered by centres contribute to quality and that operational subsidy has <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7670"> enabled community child&hyphen;care centres to offer additional services such as dance classes and music lessons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I accept that quality encompasses services as well as the developmental activities and interactions offered by a child&hyphen;care centre. However, as Senator Lundy pointed out, services such as dance classes and music lessons are `part of the choice that parents make when they send their child to a specific centre.' Such choices should not be funded by the taxpayer. The parents of the 220,000 children in private long day care centres, whether they are low or high income earners, pay for such services themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's decision to cease paying an operational subsidy to community based long day care centres will eliminate the inequities of the current system, treating families who use community based long day care no differently from the majority of families who use private long day care. Savings from this measure have been directed towards areas of need. Over the next four years, $10.9 million will be provided to fund new places to ensure families in rural and remote areas have access to flexible child care, and $31 million has been set aside to support the inclusion of children with high levels of additional needs into child&hyphen;care services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Five hundred and twenty&hyphen;six million dollars in operational subsidies will be provided over the next four years to support family day care, outside school hours care, occasional care, multifunctional children's services and multifunctional Aboriginal children's services&mdash;services which are crucial to meeting the diverse needs of Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I go on to discuss the second measure implemented by this bill, the change to the child&hyphen;care cash rebate, I would like to address some of the misconceptions that have been raised in the course of this debate about the position in Tasmania. Tasmania, as has been pointed out, has more community based long day care centres than it has private centres. Senators opposite have described Tasmania as being rural and remote; that it is disadvantaged. Senator Mackay went on to claim that the government's decision would <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mean that half of the existing community based centres will close over the next two years as every centre is reliant on the operational grants subsidy to survive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I indicated at the start of my speech, the removal of operational subsidy is about equity for parents. Why should the 555 high income families using community based long day care in Tasmania receive the benefit of a subsidy that the 427 low income families in private centres in Tasmania cannot access? As is the case in every state and territory, community based child-care centres in Tasmania do not necessarily care for low income families. I am aware of one child-care centre in southern Tasmania where 56 per cent of the children attending the centre have parents whose incomes are above the child-care assistance cut&hyphen;offs. The national average is only 26 per cent. In the rural and remote regions of Tasmania family day care provides more child&hyphen;care places than does community based long day care&mdash;517 places compared to 378 places. As I said stated earlier, operational subsidy has been retained for family day care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While there are more community based centres in Tasmania than there are private centres, there is no significant difference in fees between the two sectors. On average the community based sector charges only $4 a week less than private centres. The average weekly fee charged by community based centres in Tasmania is $155.50 for 50 hours of care, while private centres charge on average $159.50 per week. Despite receiving on average $25 per week per child, Tasmanian parents are not necessarily benefiting from operational subsidy. And I note that the previous government and this government over the last two years have put $232,000 into management restructuring grants and to deal with problems of community child-care centres, looking at pre-existing management problems and problems relating to committee governance. Yet surely that is a recognition of the fact that there has been considerable need for the restructuring finance which this government is offering to child-care centres to become viable and more efficient.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has kept its election commitment to retain child care assistance <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7671"> and the child-care cash rebate. The government has not applied a means test to the child-care cash rebate as stated by Senator Faulkner. The rebate remains available to all families using care for work related reasons. However the government considers that it is only fair and equitable that high income earners make a greater contribution to their child-care costs. Families with incomes below the new family tax initiative cut&hyphen;offs of $70,000 for one child families, rising by $3,000 for each additional dependent child, will continue to receive a 30 per cent rebate, while families with incomes above those cut&hyphen;offs will receive a 20 per cent rebate. This measure only reduces benefits for families in the top 20 per cent of incomes in Australia. So the opposition to this measure is puzzling. It is odd that the interests of higher income earners are being so keenly promoted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I conclude, there were points that were made in the debate by Senator Crowley which I wanted to address. In answer to a question by Senator Crowley on an amendment to the child-care rebate act which concerns section 36C, this amendment will prevent payment of the rebate for care provided by a registered carer to children of that carer's spousal partner or business partner in a child-care business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of a spousal partner's children, it will prevent payment of rebate for care that would usually be provided free. This is consistent with existing provisions that prevent a carer claiming rebate for caring for their own dependent children. In the case of a business partner, it ensures that a parent cannot pay their own business for child care and then claim the rebate on that payment. I trust that that gives the answer Senator Crowley was looking for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The measures contained in this bill eliminate Labor's inequities and establish a strategic direction for child care which is sustainable in the long term and protects the benefits of low and middle income earners while ensuring that high income earners who can afford to make a greater contribution to child-care costs do so. I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition opposes schedule 1, page 3, lines 2 to 9. This amendment goes to the very important issue of operational subsidies. I think I need to place on record that Australia's child-care system was one of the best in the world. I have said this before in this chamber. I have indicated that I do not believe it was an absolutely perfect system, but it certainly was a child-care system that did this country proud.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as the Labor Party is concerned, our record speaks for itself. Australia's child-care system, in fact, was built on the Labor Party's commitment and belief that child care should be treated with the same seriousness as is aged care and education. It was that commitment that led Labor to build a $1 billion child-care program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The particular schedule that the opposition is opposing here seeks to eliminate the operational subsidy that is currently paid to community based long day care. The opposition is committed to opposing this particular schedule for a number of very good reasons. Firstly, we take very seriously our responsibilities as an opposition to keep this very deceitful government to its promises. This is a government that made clear before the election that they intended to keep the operational subsidy for community based long day care. This is yet another promise to be defined as a `non-core promise', one that the coalition believes it is appropriate for it to break.  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a government that made clear before the election that they intended to keep the operational subsidy for community based long day care&mdash;of course, yet another promise to be defined as a non&hyphen;core promise, one that the coalition believes it is appropriate for it to break. The effect of removing the operational subsidy will be that centres will have two choices: they will put up their fees by anything up to $20 and $25 a week per child or they will have to reduce their services&mdash;and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7672"> that is the alternative that the government favours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One service that all the community based centres around Australia are considering removing is the more extensive, highly qualified staff that they have in their centres. The direct impact of that of course will be a reduction in the quality of care that children in community based centres have in this country. Parents will be required to pay more for food or provide lunches for their children in child&hyphen;care centres. That will mean that parents will be indirectly paying more for their children's care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other sorts of services that centres are considering removing are nappy services and other services that in any other place would be considered essential. Any suggestion that these are moves that in some way might improve efficiency can only be described as very short&hyphen;sighted indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They certainly do not equate with a definition of efficiency that I would embrace or that the Labor Party would support. The view that the government seems to have of efficiency equates with poorer quality, more children per staff member in child&hyphen;care centres, less qualified staff and fewer services. As I say, it is a very interesting definition of efficiency indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a very serious change that is proposed by the government. It really is going to abolish the notion of community based long day care in this country. This is something that the government, the coalition parties, before the election led the community based child&hyphen;care sector to believe would not happen. It is treacherous in the extreme. It is the sort of deceitful action that we have come to expect from this government that specialises in betrayal. I commend amendment 1 standing in my name to the committee.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Child care, as the coalition apparently readily agreed before the election, is a legitimate work related expense. Both parents cannot work without decently provided child care. That is a fact of life. The government does not like to hear these things, but that is the truth. Senator Newman, who is the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Family Services, the Minister representing the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women&mdash;you know how effective she is in those tasks and how many questions she has answered during this session in parliament&mdash;was exposed in her own portfolio in the committee stage of debate on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill and the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Further Budget and Other Measures) Bill. She so humiliated people. Even Senator Newman, this weak and incompetent minister, conceded that child care is a legitimate work related expense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is another example of a government broken promise, another example of betrayal by the coalition, another example of, apparently, a non-core promise. What they are saying now is, `We don't think it is a legitimate work related expense. We think the whole amount spent on child care should be reduced.' The rebate recognised that child care was a legitimate work related expense, but it was not introduced in a way that gave much more benefit to those at the top of the income scale and, of course, zero to those who did not earn any taxable income. This is another retrograde step from this government. It is another broken promise from this government&mdash;another message to working women that their place is in the home, not in the work force. That is the truth of the matter.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7674">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know why Senator Hill is interested in prolonging this debate. The truth of the matter is that before the coalition government was elected earlier this year, Australia had one of the best child-care systems in the world. That is the truth of the matter. It was a child-care system built as a result of Labor's commitment over 13 years to child care. Since the election you have done everything you can to ensure that our child-care system unravels. That is what this mob are about.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Absolutely. Thank you, Mr Chairman. You promised no change to the child-care cash rebate. Again, that broken promise is enshrined in law&mdash;a law that enshrines two broken promises, a law that says to all the women and men who use child care, to the families in Australia, `We actually are not serious about maintaining child care as affordable.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Coupled with the other changes that you have introduced, child-care fees will rise on 1 January by at least $20. It may be a bit less, but most likely it will be a lot more. That is what this bill will do, and it means that lots of families will not be able to continue with child care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very important to note that the child-care cash rebate is particularly targeted at families where one or both parents are working, studying, training or looking for work. But the loss of the operational subsidy, the increase of costs because of the changes that we were not able to disallow in this place despite our best efforts the other day&mdash;and they include the freezing of child-care assistance, the doing away of the $30 child disallowance for a second and third child and so on&mdash;are going to contribute to dramatic increases in the cost of child care, and that will impact not only on the working families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator McGauran, get around to visiting a child&hyphen;care centre. You told me once before you had never been near one. There is nothing like shooting your mouth off when you don't know what you are talking about&mdash;but what's new?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The minister might like to seek further information on this. One of the major concerns in the recent past concerning this very issue was a ruling by the tax department about the status of fringe benefits tax exemption for child care. It was proposed quite clearly under the act that any child-care costs enjoyed by an employer providing child care <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> on site were legitimately fringe benefits taxable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was another understanding though that, for people who could not get child care provided on site, any amount of money, usually around $1,000 to $1,500 a year, spent by employers to reserve a place in a child-care centre would also be fringe benefits tax exemptible. But a number of employers, in enterprise agreements with their workers, came to an arrangement of salary sacrificing in effect, which was a way in which the fringe benefits tax began to apply. This was a very critical point for a number of child-care centres, particularly those in the CBD.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the tax office finally ruled on its draft ruling and changed its decision to alter fringe benefits tax for child care, a number of child-care centres went straight out of business. There were certainly job losses associated with it. Those were the people&mdash;in fact the top end of town&mdash;who were eligible for the child-care cash rebate. So I urge your further investigation into this matter.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Schedule 2, item 22, page 14 (line 26), omit `Penalty: 20 penalty units.'.</PARA>
<PARA>Here we have a situation where the government is proposing to insert a new penalty provision where penalties already exist for providing false and misleading information. The view of the opposition is that this particular provision is completely superfluous and absolutely unnecessary. It is hardly surprising that we have a provision in a bill under the stewardship of such an incompetent minister as Mrs Moylan in the House of Representatives who has been forensically exposed by Jenny Macklin, the shadow minister, in this particular area. In fact, I think this has even been the subject of debate in the House of Representatives, while we on this side of the chamber, and some other senators&mdash;most of us with the exception of Senator Newman&mdash;have been concentrating on the social security legislation before the chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask the minister at the table why the minister believes that this provision is necessary, given the fact that section 60 of the substantive act, which already has a considerable section in relation to penalty provisions, is required.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(2.12 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the answer to the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate is something like this. Currently the act imposes penalties for people knowingly making false or misleading statements in connection with registration or claims under the act. Whether a statement is false or misleading depends on the circumstances in which it is made and is open to interpretation in a court of law. The proposed penalty provisions are different. They relate to situations which are not open to interpretation, such as whether or not a cancellation notice of family payment or family income has been issued to a person, or to circumstances that would make a carer's registration no longer valid. If the situation exists, the person must notify the commission of it in writing. If they do not, they are subject to the penalty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The interesting thing is that legal advice on the opposition amendment to remove the penalty provision from proposed section 58 is that this would render the provisions unenforceable. I find it very hard to understand why the opposition is persisting with their amendment, Mr Chairman. They have tried this tack in the other house and have already been apprised of the fact, if they did not know when they started out on this engagement whether their amendment was to be successful, that they would replace the $2,000 penalty with a term of imprisonment. If that is what the opposition considers to be a more desirable outcome, then one could only assume that they will be urging us all to support their amendment very thoroughly. The government thinks that a $2,000 penalty would be quite sufficient and a term of imprisonment is not appropriate.</PARA>

<PARA>Mr Deputy President, I am sure that at the end of a long session and at nearly 2.30 a.m., you would not mind me recognising that this has been an exceptionally good year for the new government. It is a government that was elected with a big mandate. It has had the opportunity and has already demonstrated its commitment to implement its program for the benefit of all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When one reflects on what has been achieved in this session, we have seen major reforms. The changes to industrial relations in this country via the workplace relations legislation, which will allow employers and employees to work together for their mutual benefit in an unprecedented way in this country, can only be of benefit to all Australians. The decision to sell one&hyphen;third of Telstra, which will lead to a more competitive and efficient telecommunications industry, will give us the opportunity to repay large sums of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7682"> public debt and therefore take pressure off interest rates and help small business and, therefore, help the unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen the introduction of the family tax initiative, which has been spoken about a bit tonight. It has the opportunity to benefit some two million Australian families, particularly those in the lower to middle income levels. The implementation of the national firearms program was a wonderful reform in this country that will ensure that we do not head down the path of those countries in which carrying weapons is part of their culture. It is taking us for the first time in a new direction in relation to firearms. We have seen a great demonstration of leadership from the new Prime Minister, Mr Howard, on that particular reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The introduction of very significant reforms to higher education, schools and vocational education will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of education in this country and enhance its quality and opportunity for all Australians. If I might be allowed to say it, reforms have been introduced to secure the funding base to set up for the first time in the history of this country a natural heritage trust that will allow the reinvestment of $1.1 billion in our natural heritage. It is a wonderful opportunity. It is a moment of history that will be remembered by future generations. It is a very exciting agenda and it has been a great thrill to achieve so much in just a short period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to pay credit to my colleagues. They worked hard, they had a sense of purpose and they cooperated. I turn around and see the whips, my ministerial colleagues, the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Campbell) and the whole team. Senator Ferguson did a great job. They all deserve credit for the achievements that we have been able to put on the register in just a short period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to thank the other side&mdash;the Labor Party, the Democrats, the Greens and the Independents&mdash;for at least their cooperation in the process, because without that cooperation we would not have had the opportunity to put to the vote such a very large legislative program in a short period of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> time. I do record our appreciation for that cooperation which has enabled us to put so many of our reforms into place on such an early occasion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take this opportunity at the end of the year to thank the officials, the clerks, the Senate staff, attendants, security, transport, Hansard, library&mdash;all of those who work so hard for this institution and to enable us to fulfil our legislative responsibilities. Half past two in the morning is a good time, I think, to add extra thanks to them for service beyond the normal call of duty. All that is left for me is, on behalf of the government, to wish everyone a merry Christmas and a happy New Year.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to acknowledge the parliamentary liaison officers, Gail Bansemer who has just come on board in the Senate, and Nhan Vo Van. I do wish Nhan Vo Van well. He has gone to work for Senator Hill&mdash;probably a pretty poor career move, frankly&mdash;and I hope that he does not bring the government up to speed too quickly on parliamentary business. Oh boy, he's got his work <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7683"> cut out for him. Nhan was appointed to the very important position in the Senate of parliamentary liaison officer in the good old days when I was Manager of Government Business, and we wish him well in his new found home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This year has been a very eventful one in Australian politics. It has not been a great year for the Labor Party&mdash;and we have acknowledged that&mdash;since what was a very thumping defeat back in March. We suffered an awful loss at the election and all of us in the caucus of the parliamentary Labor Party saw the departure of very many of our good friends and comrades. But, for all that, I think that it is a great thing that the Labor Party has remained so strong and so united since that adversity in March. Slowly but surely, with the support of our party members and our supporters, we are rebuilding the party and we look forward to the challenges ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have to acknowledge that we have taken some knocks on legislation in the Senate. I admit that the passage of the Telstra bill was a blow. It was a blow not only to the Labor Party and our membership, but to the whole Australian community. But we are proud of our efforts in relation to our parliamentary struggle on that bill. We fought long and we fought hard to secure a very important amendment to the Telstra bill. The truth is that we did not have the numbers and we did not have the pork, but we fought it out, as we have on all the legislation that has come before the chamber, every inch of the way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to thank, very sincerely, the deputy leader, Senator Nick Sherry, who has done such an outstanding job in this parliament, my frontbench colleagues, the Manager of Opposition Business, Senator Carr, the whips, and all my friends and colleagues in the parliamentary Labor Party. The cooperation and support that I have had from them as leader is something that I have very much appreciated. The opposition in the chamber has put in a great team effort since the election, and I think that is a credit to each and every one of my colleagues, who have really put their shoulder to the grindstone. For my part, I sincerely appreciate it and acknowledge it.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we have made an effective team here in the Senate. We have been able to keep the government more than on their toes in this place. We have already got a couple of ministerial scalps in the Senate hanging off the belt; we have got a series of members of the executive in the Senate, ministers in the Senate, who I think we have been able to expose and humiliate. It has been a very weak performance, in fact, from a very weak government team. So my sincere thanks go to all of my colleagues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to place on record Labor senators' appreciation of the tremendous efforts of the leader of the parliamentary Labor Party, Kim Beazley. It has been an outstanding performance in very difficult circumstances. I say to Kim and his team&mdash;Gareth Evans, the deputy leader, and Simon Crean, the Manager of Opposition Business in the House of Representatives&mdash;that we thank them for their support, friendship and, of course, leadership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to place on record the support that we on this side of the chamber have received from our staff. It has been absolutely fantastic. My personal thanks go to all the opposition staffers, be they staffers of frontbenchers or backbenchers in this place. It is true to say that none of us would have been able to operate without the support and the enthusiasm of members of our staff, and we sincerely appreciate that. They, too, have adapted extremely well to new circumstances, to difficult circumstances, and I think they have done wonders with their limited resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I certainly want to say a particular word of appreciation and thanks to my own staff, who have worked so fantastically and have been so dedicated throughout the life of the parliament. I appreciate it very much. We would not have been able to be anywhere near as effective an opposition&mdash;or, in my case, as effective an opposition leader&mdash;without their support. I appreciate it very much. I want to pay tribute to their efforts tonight in this valedictory speech.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to senators from other non&hyphen;government parties and to government senators, obviously, these spring sittings have been a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7684"> long session for us all. I join with the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Hill) in wishing all of you a happy Christmas, a successful new year, and I hope that all senators in the chamber and all those who work in Parliament House and work with us all have an opportunity of having a well deserved rest with their families and friends over Christmas.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make some observations at this time. I think all 76 of us would feel particularly humble that there are so many people in this building who work so hard and with such dedication to enable us to function as we do in this chamber. It is not my intention tonight to refer to all of them, but I do want to refer to three who will not be part of the functioning of the parliament when we next come back here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most significantly of all, of course, I refer to Malcolm McGregor from Hansard. I am pleased that you are present at this time, Malcolm. There is a great deal that can be said about anyone who has given 40 years of public service, almost 30 of them to this parliament. I shall not embarrass Malcolm by canvassing the whole of his career, but there are some things that ought to be said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having completed his education, he became a court shorthand reporter in the New South Wales court system and became part of the Hansard staff of the federal parliament in 1967, the third longest serving officer of the current Hansard staff, and on the Monday before last he completed 40 years of public service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Malcolm joined Hansard, Harold Holt was Prime Minister, John McEwen was the Deputy Prime Minister, Senator Denham Henty was the Leader of the Government in this chamber, Senator Lionel Murphy was Leader of the Opposition and Senator Sir Alister McMullin was the President.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Malcolm's career through the ranks of Hansard has been steady and consistent, with the sort of commitment that he has always given to the parliament, adjusting from the very early days of very much pencil and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> notebook, to the highly mechanised system that we have here today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nine presidents, eight speakers of the House of Representatives, nine prime ministers&mdash;it is an impressive record. Hansard has been very much part of Malcolm's life, along with the other activities that went with it&mdash;parliamentary committees, premiers conferences, ministerial bodies such as CHOGM and conferences of that nature.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There would be many highlights and anecdotes, if he was prepared to share them with us. I understand that in the 1970s, there was an occasion in the old Parliament House when the electricity failed and the chamber was plunged into darkness. To assist senators to leave the chamber, matches were struck and cigarette lighters were lit. I do not know what we would do today, now that nobody smokes. But in those days, it was possible to provide a little light by this means. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time, Senator Gordon Davidson was addressing the chamber. Plunged into darkness, but with the assistance of cigarette lighters, it was possible for Senator Davidson to observe that Hansard was still at its post, so to speak. In other words, Malcolm was at the Hansard table. So Senator Davidson said, `Well, Hansard is still here, so I shall continue my remarks.' I understand Malcolm's response at the time was not reported in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, but it was to the effect that in darkness it was not really easy to record what anybody was saying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Life at Narooma will indeed be pleasant and I hope the fish are waiting for you, Malcolm, when you get there. I hope that you will continue to enjoy golf at Royal Canberra Golf Club and improve your handicap and enjoy being a part of this community. As a non&hyphen;working person I hope that you will not see this hour of the night very often, unless it is a very good party and something worth while.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Rabbitohs perhaps will climb up a bit as time passes but the Raiders will still be there. I am sure that, between the two of them, you will have a football team you can enjoy watching.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite simply, from all of us, thank you for your dedication. The parliament depends upon people like you. We are very <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7685"> indebted to you for what you have given to us over so many years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ralph Bain from the ABC retires today. I do not think he is here tonight. I cannot see his silvery locks behind the window. He has given a great deal of service to this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Hamish Mitchell from the gardening service retires to go to another job in Melbourne. He has been very much a part of the development of the grounds and gardens of this building, which are splendid. In recent times, he has been involved with allowing the public in to see the gardens. What he has done for the President's courtyard in the last few months is certainly magnificent. His career is going extremely well. Because of that, he has been enticed to Victoria to a good job down there. Hamish will be missed, and I am sure all of us wish him well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I give my thanks to all occupants of the building for what they have contributed this year. I wish them a happy Christmas and an opportunity to recover from this session, as I hope we all will, and return next year.</PARA></INTERJECT></PROCTEXT></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was going to make a lengthy contribution. But, since I have imposed such discipline on coalition senators, I will truncate my speech as many of them have done. Could I firstly congratulate you, Madam President, on your new role in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a time for some valedictory remarks. We have had a number of senators leaving us during the past few months but we have also had a large troupe of new people join us. In an entirely non&hyphen;partisan way and having entered into debate with them during the workplace relations bill, I think that all of them&mdash;and there are too many to name&mdash;have slotted into the Senate very well. I guess it is very much jumping in at the deep end with a sitting the length of this one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Could I also say that I wish my close friend and colleague Senator Crane a very brief convalescence and hope to see him back with us on 4 February. I hope that he enjoys a very restful summer and good health soon.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those who like statistics, the Senate has had a very busy year. We actually sat on 71 days of this year&mdash;probably 71 and a bit now&mdash;which was only seven days less than 1995, and that is quite a record for an election year. The Senate, when this speech was written, had passed 83 bills. It might have gone up to 90&hyphen;odd by tonight. That was quite considerably less than 1995 when we passed over 183 bills. There were reasons for that. It was an historic year. We had two of the longest debates in Senate history. The workplace relations bill was the second longest debate in Australian parliamentary history and the Telstra bill took quite a long time as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From the point of view of being the Manager of Government Business, in government legislation time in 1996 we averaged about 10 hours and 42 minutes per week, which was about an hour or so less than the averages for the previous two years, but we achieved about half the amount of bills being passed through the chamber. People should not be too concerned about that because I do not think there is a great correlation between the amount of legislation we pass and the wellbeing of the good citizens of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I thank in some detail the people who work in the building and to whom you, Madam President, have paid special attention. Firstly, Senator Panizza, Senator Calvert, Senator Evans and Senator Conroy, the whips and their staff. Indeed, those of us who were involved in those leaders' and whips' meetings, including Senator Harradine, Senator Colston, the Green senators&mdash;Dee Margetts and Bob Brown&mdash;Vicky Bourne and Cheryl Kernot, Senator Faulkner and Senator Chris Evans, who through long discussions, often coming from opposite points of view and through cooperation and consensus that were often hard fought and hard gained, have been able to make this place work. We achieved the legislation this last week through cooperation from all senators, and I have learnt in this job that you need the cooperation of everybody in this place to make things work. So I thank, particularly, the whips and their staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank the clerks, Harry Evans, Anne Lynch, Rosemary Laing, Cleaver Elliott and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7686"> the others, who are an absolutely pivotal part of this place. They give us guidance and, at short notice, under enormous stress&mdash;at least to us anyway&mdash;give incredibly outstanding and impartial advice that makes this place tick.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To the parliamentary counsel who turn our political ideas and policies into a legislative form, who turn our often handwritten scribbled amendments into some sort of legal translation, particularly Hilary Penfold and her staff, I extend my thanks for the outstanding job they do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people in the Table Office, working in extremely cramped quarters, John Vander Wyk, Angie and Bev, who have provided so much crucial support to all of the Senate, have done an outstanding job and deserve a very good Christmas holiday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Parliamentary Liaison Office, which Senator Faulkner referred to: Nhan Vo Van has served me very well in helping me come to grips with this new job of managing government business and has provided excellent advice and guidance at a time when I needed it. Gail Vansemer has jumped very much into the deep end of this job in one of the busiest sessions in Senate history. She arrived at the most hectic time and was dropped in the deep end. But Gail's performance over the last few weeks certainly would do Kieran Perkins, another marathon swimmer, proud. The parliamentary library provided us with all the support. The Senate committee staff have had a very busy session.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also mention all of the staff in our Senate offices who perform miracles and put up with all of our funny ways; the procedure office; parliamentary printing; <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, particularly you, Malcolm, here on your last evening before your retirement; the Sound and Vision Office; PISO; all of the attendants who are always so cheerful to us, regardless of what we get up to; Senate transport, Bruce and Kearen, who always look after us so very well; and all of the drivers, the caterers and the cleaners who have had to put up with so much in these last few months&mdash;a couple of attacks of Bogong moths and all of that&mdash;in keeping the place looking tidy; the maintenance workers; the electricians; the plumbers; <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and the painters. Every one of them, as has been said in previous contributions, in their own way make a great contribution to ensuring one of the greatest democratic institutions on planet earth ticks from day to day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a large agenda which remains unaddressed in the Senate&mdash;we face a huge job. We look forward to returning to try to pass some of that legislation through this place. I conclude by again repeating my thanks to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> staff who have to get in before all of us and leave long after us. They have to grapple with our torture of the English language and try to decipher many almost inaudible interjections and render them intelligible for the record. I will now reward the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> staff by ceasing my remarks at this point and wish everybody in the building a very merry Christmas, particularly the families that we leave behind, the families of all the staff in this building that we leave behind, particularly the families of senators. I wish you well for the festive season and a safe journey home and a very happy, successful and healthy new year.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to take a very brief time to record my thanks to the people we have worked with and who have served the needs of all the senators, and to wish my colleagues on both sides of the chamber all the best for Christmas, as the day has arrived at 2.50 in the morning that we have all been looking forward to for the last two weeks.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have listened carefully to those who have spoken before me during this adjournment debate and they have covered everybody in their thanks&mdash;I will not repeat that except for a heartfelt thanks to all those mentioned specifically by previous speakers. I also would like to wish Ralph Bain and Malcolm McGregor the very best. I don't know how Malcolm hasn't gone right up the wall after 30 years of reporting parliament&mdash;and he hardly has a grey hair in his head, which is also quite remarkable. I do thank you Malcolm for what you have done over the years and I must say that Dennis Strangman, a former staffer of mine, who was in the old building for quite a large number of years and whom you knew well, had the greatest of respect for your professionalism and your ability to write down what is said the way it is said and to have it come out grammatically correct, somehow. All the very best to you and your family for Christmas and for the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This Senate has been preoccupied with economic issues&mdash;as indeed has the parliament&mdash;over the last few months. This has taken a great deal of concentration, but it is hardly uplifting stuff. Tuesday of this week was a beautiful day as I walked towards the front entrance. I generally get in before the press get out there but I didn't on Tuesday morning&mdash;I was walking around and enjoying the place. I said to the journalist, `It's a wonderful day and I was there for that historic moment at 1.30 this morning in the House of Representatives.' The House of Representatives passed a bill which I think is absolutely fundamental to the preservation of society, indeed civilisation.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I look forward to having such a measure come before this chamber because it makes an enormous change from an over&hyphen;concentration on economic matters, important though they are. It is a life and death issue and I think it will dignify this chamber to have such a measure considered. It was, indeed, an honour for me to be present during that historic moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not sure that we have mentioned the committees of this Senate in our thanks tonight but I certainly as an Independent do appreciate the work of the committees. I might just say in passing that they distil material, which is very handy for me. All in all, I just wish everybody the very best for Christmas, and a happy and a successful New Year. Thank you.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<TITLE>Superannuation</TITLE>
<SPEECH PAGE="7687" TIME="2.57 a.m." SPEAKER="Watson, Sen John" NAMEID="VJ4" ELECTORATE="TAS" PARTY="LP" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VJ4">Senator WATSON</NAME>
<STATE> (Tasmania)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(2.57 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to address an issue in a recent publication by Treasury to the Wallis inquiry into the financial system. That submission recommends that, in deregulating the superannuation industry, the responsibility for supervising the management of superannuation savings should actually fall on the investor. In essence, they are saying `caveat emptor'. The effect of their proposal, they argue, is that investors, who under liberalisation will shop around for the fund or funds which best suit them, will shy away from poorly managed funds and support those that act with integrity and produce the best outcome. Consequently, those which do not measure up to the investors' expectation of prudential supervision will actually fall by the wayside.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two significant flaws in this particular argument. Firstly, superannuation funds are not collective investments which come under the supervision of the ASC. Collective investments are managed on a `best endeavour' basis. If the manager does not perform then investors vote with their feet, as Mr George Pooley, Commissioner of the ISC, said recently. But investors in superannuation funds would not have the protection of the ASC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, investors in superannuation funds must invest; they do not have the choice of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7688"> not investing at all. The principle of caveat emptor assumes that the buyer&mdash;in this case the buyer of a superannuation package&mdash;need not buy at all. But people are required by law to purchase superannuation. Superannuation funds will survive because the compulsory nature of superannuation guarantees their survival.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, Australians are increasingly treating superannuation as their savings for the years following retirement and for their senior years. In assuming that it is a buffer against poverty in the future, they are treating it like a bank savings account. When such reliance is placed on superannuation savings, investors should be entitled to a properly supervised institution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fourthly, the ISC's recent reviews of superannuation funds have brought to light that some funds which are subject to supervision have some serious shortcomings in their prudential management. Commissioner Pooley explained to a conference in Sydney in September this year that the ISC, when undertaking its reviews, found that only 45 per cent of all funds either complied with the SIS legislation or had only minor technical breaches. He reported that the main problems were with trustees understanding neither their responsibilities nor the requirements of SIS, and that there were inadequate financial controls.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Trustees can be sued if they act wilfully or recklessly to the detriment of the members of the fund. Mr Pooley said a handful of investors would legitimately be able to sue their trustees in such circumstances. Examples were where, for instance, the trustee board had delegated virtually all of its powers to an unrepresentative executive committee. In another case, an employee who had a key role in a fund's financial affairs defrauded the company, its clients and the fund for many years. If this happens in supervised funds, how much grater is the opportunity for mismanagement of unsupervised funds?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is often too late for investors to move their funds elsewhere by the time they become aware of such malpractices. People in their senior years of life should not be subjected to unnecessary worry about whether <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> they can trust the managers of their savings. Many are at the mercy of the trustees of their funds. Their livelihoods should not be prejudiced in this way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fifthly, the likelihood that trustees would provide adequate disclosure in an unsupervised regime is extremely questionable. Mr Pooley, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of Wednesday, 11 December, is quoted as saying that half the funds the ISC looked at are making inadequate disclosures. The ISC's response to the Wallis inquiry discussion paper gives details of trustees who have failed to give members correct information about their fund. It also explains how trustees have failed to ensure that their fund was properly administered and how they have failed to ensure the prudent investment of their assets. He cites such breaches. As my time is brief, I wonder whether I could have the leave of the Senate to incorporate the remainder of my speech in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">failure to disclose parties receiving fees</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">lack of service agreements with fund managers and administrators</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">significant delays in paying benefits</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">failure to prepare an annual report</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">failure to arrange an external audit</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">poor documentation of transactions</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">uncontrolled derivatives trading</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I could go on.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nevertheless, if  these funds were under no prudential supervision the opportunity for defrauding investors would be even greater. Mr Pooley himself  says that the structure does offer protection if you make it work. Treasury seems to fear that the trustee system places the government under some moral obligation to bail out fund members who lose their money. If this is the case, the government will have a greater interest in ensuring the trustee system does work so that the government does not have to bail them out.</PARA>
<PARA><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7689"></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Liberalisation/deregulation and supervision need not be mutually exclusive. In fact, as Mr Pooley says, the more you deregulate the better the prudential supervision needs to be. "Prudential supervision is aimed at stability; it encourages financial institutions to remain solvent and investment schemes to be run well. Liberality and consistency in the rules improve efficiency by fostering competition and innovation in the marketplace." [ISC Commission Submission to the Inquiry into the Financial System, Executive Summary, Page (iv).]</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I therefore believe, Madam President, that at the same time as Australians are given more choice in the way they invest their superannuation funds adequate prudential supervision of those funds must be instituted. Failure to institute suitable prudential supervision will jeopardise the savings of thousands of Australians, and cause unnecessary distress. In the long term those worse affected will fall back on the taxpayer for their livelihood.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I finished writing this speech I received a copy of the most recent ISC media release in which Mr Pooley restated what he had said in a supplementary submission to the inquiry: "We see no alternative to `hands on ` prudential supervision of the insurance and superannuation industries.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 24 May 1996:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With reference to the statement of the World Conference on Human Rights held in Vienna in June 1993 that human rights education, training and public information are essential for the promotion and achievement of harmonious relations among communities and for fostering mutual understanding, tolerance and peace, and the fact that, as a consequence, the United Nations General Assembly in its resolution 49/194 proclaimed the years 1995&hyphen;2004 as the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) What steps have been taken by the Australian Government and each of its agencies to implement each of the five objectives and eight components of the decade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Which events, activities, projects and programs that could be and/or were regarded as coming within the broad scope of human rights education have been cancelled, are threatened, or are unlikely to proceed as a result of the economic and staffing cutbacks that the Howard Government has initiated.</PARA></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="7693" SPEAKER="Hill, Sen Robert" NAMEID="BH4" ELECTORATE="SA" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Environment" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator Hill</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable Senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">With respect to the objectives and components of the Decade Plan of Action, there are a variety of activities underway in Australia and,  through the aid program, in our region aimed at raising awareness and understanding of human rights. These take place in the government and non&hyphen;government sectors and are part of Australia's overall efforts to promote and protect human rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The following information has been provided by Commonwealth departments in respect of their human rights education activities:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in January 1996 initiated action at the Federal level to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> develop an Australian program of action for the Decade of Human Rights Education. A Working Group of Commonwealth agencies was convened to assess what is currently being done and identify areas that require development. The first step involves identifying and collating materials, courses, programs and curricula which are currently in use or available in Australia.  The next step is the development of a strategy by HREOC for the implementation of the Decade's main objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">DFAT and AusAID have commenced joint training programs for staff on human rights issues to foster greater knowledge about the role of human rights in foreign policy and development cooperation. Human rights training for DFAT and AusAID officers was introduced in a pilot form in 1994 in recognition that human rights knowledge and expertise cannot be confined to officers working directly on human rights matters but are an important skill for all officers including those on overseas postings. Efforts in 1995 were concentrated on using the experience developed in the pilot course to design a flexible course for officials of other Government Departments . The aim of the revised course is to provide officers with a sound understanding and awareness of human rights issues and government policy in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new Human Rights Training Course was launched on 22&hyphen;23 February 1996. The course covers a range of issues including the nature and history of human rights; human rights and Australian foreign policy; the UN human rights system; and the domestic aspects of human rights including the rights of indigenous peoples. It is expected the course will be offered at least four times a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia, through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has participated in  workshops organised by the Commonwealth Secretariat on human rights education. The first, held in Oxford in 1995, was attended by participants from 36 Commonwealth countries, the second, held in Port Vila from 1&hyphen;5 July, involved participants from twelve Commonwealth Pacific countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AUSAID</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Human rights related assistance provided by AusAID and under the Human Rights Fund (previously administered by DFAT) has been directed toward human rights education. Activities include legal literacy, training for the judiciary and officials, and awareness raising on children's rights. Countries involved include Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Vietnam, Bangladesh and Solomon Islands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Through AusAID, the Government approved funding of approximately $20,000 for the Asia&hyphen;Pacific Workshop of Human Rights Educators held in Sydney from 22 to 25 August. This workshop was jointly sponsored by the University of New <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7694"> South Wales' Australian Human Rights Information Centre (AHRIC) and the Diplomacy Training Program (DTP&mdash;a body based at the University of NSW that promotes human rights education for Asia&hyphen;Pacific NGOs). It was organised with the assistance of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The workshop brought together prominent NGO representatives from many Asia&hyphen;Pacific countries, including India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Thailand and the Philippines, as well as Australian practitioners, to discuss strategies for the UN Decade in the region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC) (established in 1986) is charged with increasing the understanding, acceptance and observance of human rights in Australia and has a mandate to carry our research and education programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">HREOC has developed training packages, e.g., on discrimination in employment for private sector managers, and produces a range of publications on human rights and discrimination. Australia's Federal Human Rights Commissioner (one of six full time HREOC Commissioners) has highlighted the need to develop an awareness and understanding of "rights" in Australia which would build on the well&hyphen;established awareness of a democratic civil tradition. A more detailed summary of the Commission's education activities is attached.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Following the recommendations contained in the report of the Civics Expert Group Whereas the People in 1994, a four year Civics and Citizenship Education Program was established in 1995, with $20 million committed for the formal education sectors.  The overall aim of the Civics and Citizenship Education Program was to help Australians develop the basic knowledge, skills and attitudes they need to engage effectively in civic life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government believes that to be effective, the program must also develop knowledge of basic democratic values and attitudes, such as tolerance and respect for individual and human rights. The  Program and associated curriculum materials will reflect this commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) While the Government is continuing to fund the Civics and Citizenship Education Program, its details are currently under review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Department of Social Security</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Within DSS the most significant activity undertaken relevant to human rights education is its implementation of the Department's Access and Equity Blueprint for Continuous Improvement. This is a facet of human rights education which ensures service providers within DSS are trained to assist <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> customers from diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds (including Indigenous Australians) in a culturally appropriate way. This is expressed concretely through the use of specialist staff and targeted services and includes provision of language services and multilingual publications. In these ways DSS is ensuring that customers are not disadvantaged by reason of their cultural backgrounds. For example, during the 1995&hyphen;96 financial year the Department provided interpreter services to 196,695 customers and its Multilingual Telephone Service Centres handled 366,000 calls in 53 different languages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Details of staff education and training related to human rights legislation and issues together with information about specific services responding to the needs of customers from diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds are attached.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The Department of Social Security advises that none of the human rights education activities undertaken by that Department have been cancelled or have been otherwise adversely affected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) DIMA has been involved with a number of activities associated with human rights issues. In 1995 the (former) Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs established a Secretariat to coordinate a range of activities designed to promote the goals of the International Year of Tolerance. The activities were directed to raise awareness of our achievements and to take pride in them, to recognise the social and economic advantages of our diversity, to take stock of our situation and to commit ourselves to becoming an even more tolerant Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Community Relations Agenda (CRA) Grants Program has funded a range of projects designed to help community groups relate better to one another and to foster greater tolerance and harmony. Forty&hyphen;eight grants totalling $2.24 million were awarded under the CRA Grants Program in March 1995 for a variety of innovative projects in the areas of youth, local government, law/police, media, the arts, culture and sport. Funded projects have varied widely in terms of content, approach and duration. The CRA grants were a "once&hyphen;only" event and all grants will have expired by 30 June 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">DIMA is funding the Refugee Council of Australia to carry out a number of projects to assist with the settlement of the Humanitarian Program entrants in Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The following information has been provided by Commonwealth departments in respect of their human rights education activities:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Department of Foreign Affairs Trade</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in January 1996 initiated action at the Federal level to develop an Australian program of action for the Decade of Human Rights Education. A Working Group of Commonwealth agencies was convened to assess what is currently being done and identify areas that require development. The first step involves identifying and collating materials, courses, programs and curricula which are currently in use or available in Australia.  The next step is the development of a strategy by HREOC for the implementation of the Decade's main objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">DFAT and AusAID have commenced joint training programs for staff on human rights issues to foster greater knowledge about the role of human rights in foreign policy and development cooperation. Human rights training for DFAT and AusAID officers was introduced in a pilot form in 1994 in recognition that human rights knowledge and expertise cannot be confined to officers working directly on human rights matters but are an important skill for all officers including those on overseas postings. Efforts in 1995 were concentrated on using the experience developed in the pilot course to design a flexible course for officials of other Government Departments. The aim of the revised course is to provide officers with a sound understanding and awareness of human rights issues and government policy in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new Human Rights Training Course was launched on 22&hyphen;23 February 1996.
