<PARA>The Australian Democrats argue that the government has attempted to bribe the community and the Senate by promising to implement a world-class consumer framework in return for the agreement to sell off one-third of Telstra. To this end, they promised to introduce consumer safeguards which estab <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> lish mandatory service levels in a number of areas on the condition that Telstra is sold. Apart from the fact that this is a fairly obvious admission that privatisation by itself is not going to deliver the right sorts of outcomes and that some level of regulation is necessary, the fact is that legislating for enhanced consumer protection has nothing to do with who actually owns Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By incorporating both the consumer safeguards and the sale provisions in the one bill, the government is effectively trying to force an all or nothing decision: either you vote for the sale of one-third of Telstra and you get enhanced consumer protection or you oppose the sale and with it you lose the universally desired consumer safeguards. Yet these are unrelated issues and there is simply no reason why they have to be bundled together in the same bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill currently before the Senate is essentially composed of two unrelated sections, each amending a different act. The amendments to the Telstra Corporation Act concern the proposed partial privatisation of Telstra while the amendments to the Telecommunications Act seek to enhance consumer protection through the introduction of a customer service guarantee. For this reason, the Australian Democrats, in referring the Telstra bill to the Environment, Recreation, Communication and the Arts References Committee for inquiry, asked the committee to consider whether or not this bill should be split into two or more parts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was clear that many of those who made submissions to the inquiry believed that the issues are unrelated. This is highlighted by the fact that most of the submissions received were opposed to the privatisation aspects of the bill but strongly favoured the passage of the consumer safeguards. Even some of those in favour of the sale could see no virtue in having the two issues tied together. In light of the widespread opposition to the sale, they could see that dividing the bill would largely guarantee passage of consumer protection legislation which they, along with virtually all other consumers, would like to see implemented as soon as possible. Therefore, on the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4480"> basis of the evidence provided, the committee concluded that the bill should be divided into two bills&mdash;one concerning the sale and one dealing with the customer service guarantee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dividing the bill into two separate pieces of legislation will give the Senate the opportunity to consider these matters independently. Most importantly, it will enable the Senate to vote independently upon them. The proposed consumer safeguards are to apply irrespective of whether Telstra is publicly or privately owned. As such, they need to be considered on their own merit. There is no legitimate reason why they should be entwined with the debate over whether or not Telstra is sold.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just as environment funding should be independent of the part&hyphen;privatisation of Telstra, so too should the introduction of new consumer safeguards. However, in the event that the sale bill is passed, my proposal ensures that it cannot receive royal assent until the consumer protection bill receives royal assent. This is to ensure that, in the event of the sale, consumers are not left unprotected. Any reluctance on the part of the government to divide the bill into its natural discrete components can be interpreted only as a failure to acknowledge that legislating for consumer  protection is independent of the proposed sale.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on behalf of the opposition to support the motion moved by Senator Lees to split the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill. This comes as a result of the work of the Senate inquiry into the sale of Telstra and the recommendation from the majority of that committee, namely the Democrats and the Australian Labor Party representatives, to split the bill. I will not quote all the sections in our report, but on pages 15, 16 and 17 I think we give very strong reasons why it is not unreasonable for the government to accept this motion to split the bill so that the issue of privatisation is separated from the issue of consumer safeguards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Nobody on the committee, whether they were government, Labor or Democrat members, was opposed to improving consumer safeguards. None of the evidence given to us in many hundreds of submissions was op posed to improving consumer safeguards. Even Mr Stevens, head of the department, pointed out in the hearing&mdash;this is on page 16:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The consumer safeguards are, in fact, contained in the Telecommunications Act and apply, regardless of whether Telstra is 100 per cent government owned or partially privatised.</PARA>
<PARA>The head of the department conceded that to put these consumer safeguards in you have to amend the Telecommunications Act which establishes the regulatory model for all telecommunications in Australia. That is not the act that has to be amended in principle to allow the partial privatisation of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, we believe it is only appropriate that the bill be split and that the consumer safeguards, whether they are the universal service obligations or the customer service guarantee, be separately dealt with and separately voted on. We believe it is a very bad mixture to have to vote on the second reading and forcing people to vote on one issue, which is the privatisation issue, and secondly combined with that the issue of consumer protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all support better consumer protection and no&hyphen;one has argued against that. In fact, the only evidence we have suggests that we probably should go further than what the government has proposed in amending the Telecommunications Act. We should not combine and force the vote on two quite disparate issues, one privatisation and the other consumer protection. They are in no way organically linked. They are in no way linked in principle. The privatisation issue can be dealt with quite separately.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As expressed in our support for the majority report and the committee's recommendations, the opposition believes that they should be separated. It is interesting that even Mr Horsley, the Managing Director of Australian Telecommunications Users Group (ATUG), is generally quite sympathetic towards privatisation. In his evidence he states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the circumstances and the timing that we face today, we would certainly encourage the committee. . . to attempt to separate the issues of the open competition post&hyphen;1997 processes from the privatisation processes, particularly because we have the strong view that the post&hyphen;1997 processes <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4481"> should not be delayed. . . we are of the very strong view that the open competition post&hyphen;1997 arrangements are paramount.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not finished the quote. He goes on to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is reasonable to split. . . many people in the industry would have an unequivocal commitment to the service guarantee in a multi&hyphen;carrier environment and would want to see that in place.</PARA>
<PARA>That is from Mr Horsley, whom the minister himself appointed to be part of the review process of the post&hyphen;1997 Telecommunications Act. He is an executive director of the biggest industry consumer telecommunications group, ATUG. We believe he has made the case. The committee accepted on the evidence that we had that the bill should be split so that people can vote separately on the principle issue of privatisation and not have it confused with the issue of consumer protection. I believe all senators will be supportive of that point when they come to consider it in this debate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(9.10  a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the motion by Senator Lees relating to the Telstra bills. The Greens (WA) worked quite hard in April and May of this year to make sure that all parties were talking and that they realised the importance of making sure that the bill&mdash;which at that stage was not in any form that we could see but was a proposed bill&mdash;did go out to proper inquiry. We were pleased that eventually all opposition parties came together to look at sensible wording to ensure that the community had a voice in the process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having done that, it is important that the parliament listens to what came through. It is important to note that one of the recommendations is that the bill should be more logically dealt with separately from the community service obligations point of view. Having said that, the last thing I would like to see is the sale bill going through and the government losing its commitment to community service obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore we asked&mdash;and I am pleased that it was incorporated in the amendments put by Senator Lees&mdash;that it be put into the legislation that the bill be contingent on those <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> community service obligations going through. Therefore, we can vote on them as separate issues, but we cannot allow governments to get rid of commitments to community service obligations on the basis that it has gone through, it is now privatised and they let the market take over.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the inquiry when I was able to attend we heard on a number of occasions that there is a lot of pressure within the business community. One that springs to mind is the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Western Australia, which believes that the community service obligations ought not to be continued in their current form. There were a number of other business people putting that view forward and saying that basically the taxpayer ought to pay directly for any community service obligation and the carriers should be free to make a profit, even though they were not able to do that before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is certainly not a view that I would support, but that pressure is there and I would not like to see a situation where, if the Telstra sale bill were to go through, it could then be put through without those community service obligations, inadequate as they may be. Therefore, we ask for that link to be there and for it to be voted on separately to ensure that there is no way that the government can go back on any promises it has made in relation to community service obligations.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition is supporting this proposal on the basis that we acknowledge that the committee had a specific charge to investigate this matter and recommended to the Senate that such a measure be supported. Of course, the ability to divide the bills is provided for quite clearly within the standing orders of the Senate and is a measure by which governments are held accountable in terms of drawing together unpalatable measures with palatable measures, and in particular attempting to include measures which otherwise would not attract the support of the Senate, particularly given its present make&hyphen;up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not the first time that this provision has been considered by the Senate. The advice that I have is that a proposal on 9 June 1995 concerning the Human Services and Health <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4482"> Legislation Amendment Bill was one occasion on which the Senate did agree to split the bill on the basis of a proposition advanced by Senator Harradine. The opposition at that time&mdash;and the Liberal government as it is now&mdash;supported the proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With this bill there is no necessary connection between two very distinct elements of it, and no reason, other than cynical opportunism, for those elements ever being linked. This government has drawn together two disparate measures in an attempt to draw political support for its privatisation program. It is not necessarily because it sees those matters being inherently linked. We would like to see improved consumer protection, and we will be pursuing that under a publicly owned Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill amends two principal acts&mdash;the Telecommunications Act 1991 and the Telstra Corporation Act 1991. The amendments to the Telecommunications Act relate largely to the introduction of consumer service guarantees, while amendments to the Telstra Corporation Act provide for the partial sale and also, therefore, duplicate provisions in the Telecommunications Act relating to the universal service obligation. It is quite clear that the consumer protection and access and equity provisions present the Senate with two totally different issues to consider, rather than just the Telstra provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no reason to hold up the former while the more difficult sale provisions are considered other than as a cynical exercise by the government to link the two provisions&mdash;just as the government is attempting to link the partial sale of Telstra with the funding of the natural heritage trust fund. This is the second leg of their double&mdash;the second leg of their attempt to put through the privatisation of Telstra against the overwhelming wishes of the Australian people in a manner which tries to sweeten a very bitter pill which, if taken, will leave a very nasty taste in the mouths of the Australian people for a generation to come.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor's position is quite clear. We put to the Australian people our complete opposition to the sale of Telstra. We also put our concern to improve consumer protection. We <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> believe that Senator Lees's motion will provide an opportunity for us to exercise our commitment to the Australian people on both counts. The government has a right to initiate policy but when it comes to packages like this we have the right to say no, and we will be saying no to the privatisation of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate is an appropriate vehicle through which to say to this government that this is not an appropriate policy to pursue. We do not see that there should be a linkage of these two provisions in such a way as to present the Senate with a fait accompli. We believe that Senator Lees's motion requires that two new bills be listed as a single order of the day, at the same time allowing for continued discussion of the substantive Telstra bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that we would be able to continue the debate on the substantive Telstra motion even if the proposal to divide the bill were to be carried here today. We believe that it is important that there be no attempt to sideline the sale bill but that it should be rejected. We also believe in a continued debate in connection with the consumer services provisions of the bill. The government cannot claim that this move alters the purposes and objectives of the original bill or interferes with its prerogatives in any way because both bills can be dealt with together.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government strongly opposes this attempt by the Australian Democrats to wreck its reform program in this way today. The proposed sale of one&hyphen;third of Telstra, with consumer safeguards and consumer service guarantees, was an election promise we made to the Australian people and, in part, upon which we were elected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We undertook that, in selling one&hyphen;third of Telstra, we would provide within the legislation not only for a continuation of the universal service obligation but also consumer service guarantees. We undertook that we would use the funds from that one&hyphen;third sale primarily to repay public debt while $1 billion of it would be used to set up our Natural Heritage Trust, thereby reinvesting part of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4483"> capital of this telecommunications company in the natural capital of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That bill, in accordance with our promise, was drafted and put to the Senate. It then went to a committee for comprehensive examination and that committee reported back to the Senate. Debate on the second reading of the bill has commenced in this place and is part heard. Today we have an attempt by the Democrats to scuttle this bill because they are seeking to remove from that part of it that provides for the part sale those customer service guarantees which we say are critical. All through the election and since the election we have said that those provisions were critical to the bill and part of the bill; it is an integrated package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats, through this motion today, are seeking to amend the bill in such a way that it will not meet the government's objective of providing customer service guarantees. The motion, therefore, would fundamentally change what the government intended and promised. It would also mean a failure by the Senate to face up to its responsibility to the Australian people to debate our package which, in accordance with our promise, we have introduced in this place. Because of that, and because of our determination that the bill as a whole be put to the Senate, we very strongly oppose the attempt to split it in the way suggested this morning by the Democrats.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Greens will support this motion by the Australian Democrats. It has been quite false for the government to link consumer safeguards with its doctrinaire approach to privatising essential public services and putting it into the hands of the stock exchange, instead of the legitimately elected parliament representing the people, the critical area of communications which, of course, is rapidly extending well beyond telecommunications in the modern era to functions like the internet and e&hyphen;mail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The service obligations will ensure, for example, that all Australians have access to those new communications functions and, moreover, that they get that access at a price which is equitable. They will ensure that we <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> do not end up with a situation, which is highly likely under privatisation left to its own devices, where the big end of town will get all the new services at low prices, while remote and rural consumers and poorer people in the community do not get access to those modern services, and even services that we have not thought of yet, coming down the line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will say that you can legislate to make sure that privatised industry is going to protect those services. But that only occurs as long as governments do not come under the pressure of those very wealthy private companies, and we all know the history of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a very important move. I congratulate the Democrats and Senator Lees on introducing this motion. It is a sensible way to go. It looks after the interests of the average Australian.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As many people in the Australian public would agree, it gives a sense of security about telecommunications and communications in general that we keep Telstra, this great Australian service, in the public domain and responsive to the parliament and not the Stock Exchange, while at the same time&mdash;and quite sensibly&mdash;passing through this parliament, hopefully, as a result of this move, the necessary consumer guarantees to ensure that Telstra has quite clearly in hand that its job is in the future, to ensure that all Australians have equal access to those communications services which are now an essential part of modern life.</PARA></SPEECH>

Then he went on to say that of course these consumer safeguards are very important to make sure Telstra from now on has it in mind that its obligation is to serve the Australian public. There is quite clearly a contradiction there because, if it was already in their mind that they had an obligation to serve the Australian public, then these safeguards would not be necessary.

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EU4">Senator O'CHEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly, Madam President. We will call him Senator Carr. That is the title he wants, but we know where his ideology originates. We know where his ideological bent is, and that is the only reason why we are going through this stunt as far as the Labor Party is concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me make it very clear for honourable senators. This is an attempt to split out the safeguards from the mechanisms that will make it possible for Telstra to meet those safeguards. The only consequence of splitting this will be to make it harder for Telstra to meet the obligations that are contained in the consumer safeguards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not believe that that is fair to Telstra. From 1 July next year, Telstra will have lean and much more efficient competitors than they have seen to date with Optus, competitors who can come in here and rip millions and millions of dollars off Telstra's net profit by just taking a tiny percentage of market share. A five per cent loss in market share will cost Telstra $750 million in net profit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What honourable senators will be doing if they split this bill is to say, `We believe in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the consumer safeguards, but we are not going to allow Telstra the benefit of the efficiency reforms in order to be able to take on the competition and meet the consumer safeguards'. That would be a travesty of justice for Telstra&mdash;not for the government, but for Telstra. So if honourable senators are concerned about maintaining Telstra's efficiency and the ability of Telstra to meet these new safeguards, then they should oppose this motion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moreover, there is one other thing that the Senate should consider, and that is that this is a package of reform. Everything in the package is integral. We are introducing what the Australian Consumers Association and the Tasmanian consumer union&mdash;I think they call themselves that&mdash;described as `the best possible consumer protection'. The Telecommunications Ombudsman said, `You cannot get better protection than in legislation'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You cannot split the package. It is an integral package. You cannot just say, `Look, we are going to cherry pick and we are going to have these bits here but we are not going to have the rest of it.' We believe in improving the telecommunications industry. That is why there are provisions for refunds where the obligations are not met.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Enormous problems in country Australia exist at the moment with Telstra. Senator Harradine would be aware of the problems in outlying areas where people pay enormous amounts for their telecommunications services. We want to improve that by making it more efficient. In order for that to happen, we have to have this legislation as a package and in the form in which it was introduced. You cannot split this legislation and maintain the integrity of the reforms the Australian consumer needs.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Now that we have disposed of the desperate attempt that the opposition parties indulged in this morning to prevent the proper consideration of this bill, we now come back to the substantive debate on the partial privatisation of Telstra. Let me start by saying that it is absolute and utter hypocrisy in its finest for those opposite, especially those in the Labor Party, to say that they do not believe in the partial privatisation of Telstra for ideological reasons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the Labor Party to come before the Senate and say that they do not support the partial privatisation of Telstra because it is a fine Australian company and they do not support this bill because they believe that this asset should remain in public ownership is an outrageous denial of the last 13 years when they were in government. It is an outrageous denial of the facts. The fact is that this is one of the few government owned assets which they did not get around to privatising themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are the people who were responsible for the sale of the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, the Commonwealth Bank, the defence service home loans scheme, the war veterans' home loans scheme, Qantas, Australian Airlines and the Cockatoo naval dockyards. If it moved they sold it and if it did not they tried to sell it anyway. They sold the Sydney to Moomba gas pipeline. That was another one of their achievements. The Labor Party is to privatisation what Elizabeth Taylor is to marriage&mdash;eight times married and still wanting to come before the altar like a blushing bride. Even Senator Sherry has to smile at that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These people have absolutely no shame when it comes to the issue of privatisation. If it moved they flogged it off and if it did not they pledged it to somebody else. Here they are, now that they have lost government, saying, `We do not believe in privatisation <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> anymore because we are the opposition.' The ideology that moves the people on the other side is not the ideology of reason, it is the ideology of opposition at any cost&mdash;the ideology of saying, `We will do whatever we can to oppose the operation of government.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What honourable senators should understand is that those people on the other side of the chamber are not interested in the good governance of Australia. They are solely interested in doing whatever is necessary for them to get government again. That is not the responsibility of opposition. We see all these desperate measures by the Labor Party now that they are in opposition to oppose the very principles that they stood up on this side of the chamber and espoused when they were in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a betrayal of the trust that they claim to have received from the Australian people at the last election. It is a portrayal of the principle that opposition should be constructive. That is why those opposite know deep in their souls that what they are doing in opposing this bill is wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us talk about some of the arguments we have heard from those opposite. Some of the arguments opposing privatisation are absolutely and utterly ridiculous. For example, the opposition parties have claimed that the government is proposing to sell Telstra at less than its value. They have claimed that a third of Telstra is not worth between $24 billion and $27 billion as we believe. They claim that a third of Telstra should be worth over $54 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How do they get to this price? They rely on the evidence of one man who came before the Senate inquiry in Townsville, Professor Quiggin. Professor Quiggin&mdash;and you would be very interested in this Mr Acting Deputy President Watson&mdash;has some very peculiar views on how you value companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Professor Quiggin said that when you value a company, instead of discounting the earning stream at a normal rate&mdash;at a rate which is reflective of the risk of the company and reflective of the market rate of return&mdash;you use a discount rate derived by taking the government bond rate less inflation. Professor Quiggin was advocating a couple of months <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4488"> ago that we should be using a discount rate of four per cent to value this company. As government bond rates have fallen further since then, I assume that he would be advocating that we use a discount rate of about 3.5 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us suppose that we were using a discount rate of four per cent. Following Professor Quiggin's logic, you cannot sell this company unless you are going to receive a price 25 times net earnings. There is not one company in Australia which would receive a market valuation along those lines&mdash;not one. But that is the Professor Quiggin logic, and that is the logic relied on solely by the other side when they talk about the value of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I had my staff go through the methods of valuation used by the Labor Party when they sold the long list of assets that I have already outlined to the Senate. Did they use a discount rate of four per cent when they sold the Commonwealth Bank? Of course not. Did they use a discount rate of four per cent when they sold Qantas? Of course not. Did they use a discount rate of four per cent when they sold Australian Airlines? Of course not. They knew, when they were in government, that it was a ludicrous and absurd argument. But now that they are in opposition, not only have their principles gone out the door but their economic credentials have gone out the door&mdash;what little economic credentials they had after 13 years of mismanaging the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not once when they were in government did they pick up the phone and say, `Professor Quiggin, we're planing to privatise yet another government asset. Please tell us how to do it.' They knew that Professor Quiggin's logic was utterly false. It has never been used in one privatisation anywhere in the world. Moreover, Professor Quiggin admitted to the Senate committee when we were in Townsville that he had never participated in the privatisation of one government company: he had never acted as an adviser to a government; he had never acted as an adviser to a company. This is just academic coffee table chitchat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet the people opposite are so desperate for some justification to support their prejudice <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that they seized on this. By the time those opposite had finished with the Senate hearings, they had almost put up Professor Quiggin for the Nobel Prize for Economics. The shame is that nobody else would vote for Professor Quiggin for the Nobel Prize for Economics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we got to Adelaide, the Leader of the Opposition in South Australia, Mr Rann, came before the committee. He said that Telstra was being undervalued and should be valued higher and that Professor Quiggin said this and that. I said to Mr Rann, `You were a member, were you not, of the cabinet that proposed to privatise South Australia's gas company?' He said, `Yes.' I said, `What was the discount rate that you proposed to use in the privatisation of the South Australian gas company?' All of sudden he got a case of the Lawrence disease; he could not remember.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said, `Look, was it four, five, six, seven or eight per cent?' He said, `I can't remember.' I said, `Don't tell me that you sat in a cabinet meeting, decided to privatise this company, worked out the value of it and couldn't use a discount rate to do it. You must have used a discount rate.' I then said, `Why don't you take it on notice. I'm not trying to trick you. Just go away and take it on notice and then come back and tell us whether you used Quiggin's valuation method in deciding to privatise this company when you were a member of the South Australian cabinet.' We have not had an answer to that question yet, because Mr Rann knows that he did not use Professor Quiggin's valuation method. He knows that not one sane, reputable government in Australia would use Professor Quiggin's valuation method.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does not matter when you are in opposition and you are the Labor Party, because sanity goes out the door. For the Labor Party, sanity and good economic management go out the door when they are on the other side of the chamber. They are not concerned about the good government of this country. They are only concerned with trying to whip up fear, hatred and loathing for the government. That is all that this is about. It is a cynical, base exercise in scaring the Australian population witless. That is what this is all about.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4489">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That gets me on to some of the outrageous claims that we have heard the Labor Party and the Democrats make in regional Australia. They claim that the partial privatisation of Telstra is opposed in regional Australia. To check out these claims, I actually made an effort to travel around three western Queensland towns, just two weeks ago, to talk about the partial privatisation of Telstra. It was amazing. If you believed the people opposite, the view in the bush is that Telstra should not be subject to partial privatisation. The truth is that the bush is fed up with the service they get from Telstra. To go out into the bush and say, `Telstra is a fine Australian company and should be kept as it is,' does not attract enormous support. In fact, it attracts howls of derision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the benefit of honourable senators who do not live outside the capital cities, let me explain why that is so. I live in Cairns, which is not exactly Muttaburra, Cunnamulla or Oodnadatta, but it is regional Australia. When I pick up my telephone and dial Kairi on the other side of the mountain from where I live&mdash;it is a distance of about five to 10 miles as the crow flies&mdash;I pay STD call rates even though it is within the same dialling area. I do not have to dial the STD prefix, but I still have to pay STD rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I am in Atherton and I phone Kairi, I have to pay for a timed call. It is a local call but it is a timed call. Similarly, across the vast bulk of the Australian continent and in your good state of Tasmania, Mr Acting Deputy President, this is the case. Outside the capital cities, timed local calls are the norm. And the people in the bush know that they are subsidising the untimed local calls in the city. They know that Telstra is woefully inefficient and they will do anything to make Telstra more efficient. They accept the fact that in this legislation there are still going to be untimed local calls for the city. But what they want to achieve is a reduction in the cost of the calls for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To understand the amount of subsidy that comes out of the bush for the city, you have to understand that it was given in evidence to our committee that in fact the average cost to Telstra of providing an STD call around <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australia at any time varies between 3c and 6c a minute. And yet the average call charges are often between 20c and 40c a minute. So there is an enormous profit there but it is going to subsidise the loss making operations in some of the gentler suburbs of Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In other words, the bush is cross&hyphen;subsidising the city and the bush is paying through those outrageous timed calls for the inefficiency of Telstra. Partial privatisation is designed to make Telstra more efficient so that the bush will not be subsidising the inefficiency but will be getting a decent go. After all, when you see what primary producers and small businesses in the bush have had to do to reduce their costs it is not unreasonable to expect Telstra to reduce its costs as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we come to the other great furphy: that if we have partial privatisation of Telstra what will happen is that  thousands of people in the bush will lose their jobs. But, of course, the truth is that this government is proposing for the first time since telephones were installed in the bush to give people in the bush the same opportunity to get high quality telecommunications as people in the city because we are going to accelerate the roll&hyphen;out of the 64&hyphen;kilobyte link to just about every country town in this nation. We are taking about the roll&hyphen;out of high quality fibre&hyphen;optic cable right around this country. So rather than decreasing the employment in telecommunications in the bush, we will increase the number of people employed in the telecommunications industry in the bush over the next couple of years. Of course, that was something that those opposite did not want to know about in their blind prejudice in reading this bill.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are talking about here is the facts. I know the Labor Party do not like facts in large doses. A few facts each day are more than enough to challenge their prejudices. But what we are talking about here is the facts. The facts are, as Mr McLean, who is the State Secretary of the CEPU in Queensland said, there will not be any job losses in the telecommunications industry from partial privatisation. He said that all that would happen is that people will go from working for Telstra to working for skilled engineering. He accepted, as many other did who appeared before the inquiry, that job growth in the telecommunications industry had increased at a quite substantial pace over the last four or five years and would continue to increase. In fact, the competitors to Telstra like Vodafone who came before our committee said, `Look, we can't get enough skilled technicians.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what is this all about? It is not about the number of people in jobs in the telecommunications industry. It would be an outright lie to say that the opposition to this was about the number of people in jobs in the telecommunications industry. This is about the number of people employed in Telstra who can be forced into a union. What terrifies the people opposite is that if these people go from working for Telstra to working for skilled engineering, as Mr McLean himself has said, they might not be cajoled or coerced or corralled into joining a union.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what this is all about. This is merely about maintaining the ability of the CEPU to force people against their will to join a union. It is not any sort of argument about maintaining employment levels in the telecommunications industry and it is not about maintaining the value of our telecommunications infrastructure. In fact, if we do not have the partial privatisation, if we do not have the reforms, if we do not have the efficiency, the value of our telecommunications in fact will be reduced.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not about any of those things; it is about the blind prejudice of those who want to maintain the ability of the CEPU to get people to join their numbers without having a choice. They know that whilst Telstra is a government instrumentality they can force people to do these things and they know that if Telstra were partially owned by the private sector, if these people were working for another company, they would not have the same coercive power. That is what this is about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not about the bush. It is not about delivering decent standards of telecommunication. It is not about giving people in Oodnadatta or Cunnamulla or Muttaburra a fair go. What this is all about is maintaining a telecommunications company which is inefficient by its own admission, which does not service the bush and, as far as the Labor Party is concerned, exists to force people to join the CEPU. This is not about making Australia a better place. This is not about good economics&mdash;heaven help us if Professor Quiggin was all about good economics: this is about supporting the blind prejudice of the Labor Party which has suddenly decided to ditch every single one of their principles just because they were forced to sit on the other side of the chamber. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<STATE> (Australian Capital Territory)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(10.08 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very interesting for me to have this opportunity to contribute to this debate on the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill after hearing the ranting diatribe from our colleague across the chamber Senator O'Chee. Australia and indeed the world are in the midst of an evolutionary phase in the development of telecommunications. The convergence between the technologies is indicative of the new approach to information services in the corporate sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rapid advances in digital compression technology and processor capability are reshaping our expectations of the level of service that we will have available to us. Governments are confronted with fresh challenges as new and hybrid technologies emerge. The task this presents is to ensure that the public interest is served, not the interests <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4491"> of private corporations, as Senator O'Chee alluded to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Australia, the countdown to full and open competition is continuing, but the legislative framework still needs to be finalised. This whole transition is occurring at a time when technological convergence in information service and delivery is becoming a feature of telecommunications entities as they position themselves to maximise market share and subsequent profit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How the government handles this transition will be a considerable factor for both the future viability of the Australian telecommunications industry and the quality of services available to both homes and business, whether in rural or urban areas. Both these issues present significant challenges for legislators. It is essential that we reach out and seize the opportunities that are presented to us through this period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I mentioned before, Senator O'Chee made a ranting contribution to this debate. Senator O'Chee spent a large percentage of his time dwelling on what Labor has done and what has happened in the past. I think this is a very telling point about the attitude of this government. Does it care about what happens next, about the future, or is it too committed and too bogged down in trying to discredit decisions that have been made previously? I say that its energies would be far better spent on the future of the telecommunications industry and its services to customers in Australia. What happens next year? What happens the year after that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government should get its focus right. If this government had any vision beyond the next election, it would realise that decisions made now will determine whether or not Australia continues to ride the technology wave or just falls off the back, never to catch up. A long-term view in telecommunications is crucial.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is currently uniquely positioned in telecommunications in a global sense as well as in a national sense. We live in a country where our vast geography has by necessity created a dimension to our industry that is unparalleled anywhere else in the world. Australia's leading role in the development of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> optical fibre is one example. We have heard again this morning that it is that optical fibre roll&hyphen;out that presents a unique perspective to our industry and its development here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of these strengths must be attributed to the role that Telstra has played as a publicly owned corporation. The introduction of full competition can and will be used to further this advantage, but partial privatisation or full privatisation&mdash;which we know will be the eventual outcome&mdash;is not going to have any impact on the improvement of competition. This role of Telstra as a publicly owned corporation must not be squandered or abused, and that is what this is all about. The privatisation would equate to just that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To sell Telstra in the way that this government proposes represents the extraordinary contempt with which this government holds the people of Australia. To even attempt to sell in the period of legislative change that we are going through with telecommunications is absolutely ludicrous in the extreme. This government wants to squander one of the best opportunities that this country has had for industry development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a participant in the committee that inquired into this matter, I found that, not surprisingly, ideological obsession was exposed as the primary motivation for pursuing this sale. Not only is this government seemingly oblivious to the opportunities, but it is unwilling to acknowledge the damage that its agenda with respect to Telstra will inflict upon the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The linking of some of the profits from the sale of Telstra to the funding of the Natural Heritage Trust programs represents the most cynical political move ever seen. It was with great mirth that I heard Senator O'Chee speak about cynicism with respect to Labor's approaches to this particular issue. The Australian community and the environmental organisations have been exposed to blackmail. Ironically, not through the Telstra inquiry, but through the inquiry into the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill, those same environmental organisations have discredited entirely the linkage and the attempt at blackmail by this government.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4492">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is becoming quite common knowledge that this linkage is the source of some hilarity within the government ranks. I think this says so much about the regard that this government holds for the people its represents, particularly those people who have conservation and repair of our natural environment as their primary concern. It is a slap in the face.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the linkage with the environment bill and the ideological motivation for the sale, what does this in turn say about the government's attitude towards the role that telecommunications play in our society? The ability to communicate and access to information are determinants of power in our society. Telstra's dominant role in telecommunications makes it a player in ensuring equity of access&mdash;the ability for everybody to use the services it provides.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the current context the government must move decisively to ensure equity of access. Ministerial direction must be maintained if people are to be considered before profit. The broad terms of reference in the Senate inquiry into the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill allowed a wide expression of views on this matter. The range of issues explored form a solid base of information for use when decisions are taken regarding the post&hyphen;1997 regulations and, indeed, the degree of intervention that occurs in the telecommunications industry. It is crucial that this wealth of knowledge, facts and opinions brought into the public arena as a result of the Senate inquiry be used as widely and as extensively as possible. Not to do so would be a further contemptuous act by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is, however, not surprising that the government so vehemently denigrated that inquiry process. When you look at the outcomes, it becomes obvious that they anticipated there was no substance to their argument. It may be that the government never anticipated having to justify the privatisation&mdash;instead, hoping to rely on blackmail to find the cross&hyphen;bench support necessary for this bill's passage through this place. Despite the grandest efforts of this government, the only skerrick of productivity benefit that could be attributed to any privatisation of a public utility was that of a Chilean company under Pinochet's <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> dictatorial regime, and that was a mere 1.5 per cent. They had to dig pretty deep and look far and wide to come up with that one, I can assure you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is significant that the primary evidence used by Telstra, by the Department of Finance and by the Department of Communications and the Arts was exposed as being fundamentally flawed. Whatever argument the government puts up on this in refuting the evidence put forward, you cannot refute the words on the papers of the studies that they use to prop up their arguments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The evidence to which I am referring, a World Bank study, published in 1992, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Privatisation: The Lessons of Experience</EMPHASIS>, by Kikeri and others, is not an empirical analysis of the benefits of privatisation at all&mdash;which is what the government has asserted. This report is but an appraisal of privatisation policies. It does not even attempt to analyse the improvements in services or productivity that may or may not arise as a result of privatisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is even acknowledged in a later World Bank study by Galal and others, published in 1994. In this report of the 7,000 or so privatisations that have occurred, only around 2.5 per cent are in OECD countries&mdash;that is, comparable countries to Australia. In the same report research summaries of the welfare consequences of 12 privatisations are examined, of which only three are in telecommunications companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further indictment of the comparative value of these studies to Telstra is an admission by the authors of the 1994 report that says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are less than sanguine when it comes to selection bias. Our cases are by no means a random sample of public enterprises around the world.</PARA>
<PARA>With regard to the 1992 report, the author offers the justification for privatisation in the following words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . evidence from a wide variety of countries shows that far too many State owned enterprises have been inefficient and have incurred heavy financial losses . . . In many countries they have been an unsustainable burden on the budget and the banking system, absorbing scarce public resources. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4493"> </PARA>
<PARA>This is hardly a description of Telstra, which is producing multibillion dollar profits this year. There is no doubt that, in the light of such flimsy evidence, the government has turned to repetitive derogation of the inquiry process and the majority report where we have proven there is no factual substance to their argument at all, despite the earnest assertions otherwise by Senator Tierney and Senator O'Chee. It has been shown that there is no substantiation and no benefit to the public or to the future of the telecommunications industry at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also quite significant that Telstra's employment levels, jobs&mdash;reminding you, of course, that the jobs issue formed the basis of the election campaign for this government back in March&mdash;would be reduced by 24,000 via a strategy exposed by my colleague Senator Carr during the course of this inquiry. So I am flabbergasted to hear Senator O'Chee's assertions here this morning that, in fact, jobs will not go. Sorry, we know they will, we have the facts&mdash;and Telstra have acknowledged that. Project Mercury represents the shedding of one-third of Telstra's employees&mdash;one-third!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to see that downsizing of that nature has been criticised by its main proponent, Stephen Roach, a leading economist currently with Morgan Stanley. This fellow led much of the debate which promoted corporate downsizing as a means of retaining a competitive edge. Now Mr Roach has reassessed his views. I would like to share a few comments from Mr Roach with respect to this type of downsizing. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the former approach only hollows out companies without providing general economic growth.</PARA>
<PARA>In a recent Australian interview he went on to say that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . if all you do is cut you will eventually be left with nothing, with no market share.</PARA>
<PARA>And:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . at the end of the day you can create wealth only if you've got a corporate sector that has its act together and takes a long term strategic view.</PARA>
<PARA>That long-term strategic view takes me to the next few points I would like to make.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite significant that there has been a reduction in investment in hardware and infrastructure within the Telstra research laboratories, or TRL, with Telstra choosing instead to focus on information services. This is despite specific acknowledgment by Telstra management that TRL's strengths in these areas have `served Telstra, its predecessors, and the country very well'. In response to questioning in estimates as to who will take up the slack with respect to this research, Telstra believes that the manufacturers will. The manufacturers identified, of course, are Alcatel, Ericsson and Siemens and, to a lesser extent, Nortel. I think everybody knows that these are not Australian companies, although they do have significant presence here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since March, 44 staff from TRL have been given the punt, and another 133 jobs will be going in TRL. The vast majority of those jobs are in the professional and technical areas. This represents a 30 per cent cut to TRL&mdash;the research arm of Telstra. I think this highlights a very disturbing shift in Telstra's research and development policy and reinforces the need to ensure public accountability through the implementation of regional industry development strategies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another signal from Telstra is that, in their pursuit of potential private investors and their efforts in tidying up the books, they are sacrificing long-term projects. They are sacrificing long-term projects that would have positioned Telstra down the track in a position of strength, in the way that studies and investment they conducted many years ago did.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One such project that has been abandoned recently is, of course, the Gungahlin broadband project. Gungahlin is a region in the ACT; it is a new suburban area. This particular project was abandoned in its original form at about the same time&mdash;surprise, surprise&mdash;as the privatisation bill hit the lower house. A different project has since emerged to assist in the damage control that the company had to initiate to buffer themselves not only from investor backlash but from charges that, in fact, it did represent a move away from long-term research into short-term strategies with a short-term gain.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4494">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Policies of the Labor government over the last decade have generated one of the fastest OECD growth rates in the research and development investment by business as a share of GDP. However, Australia still retains one of the lowest ratios of business expenditure in research and development to GDP, at 0.7 per cent. The fact is that you need to look at those broad policy settings in the context of what is happening in Telstra with their investment in research and development and how an emphasis on privatisation can detract so wholeheartedly from long-term investment in research and development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In commenting on the changes within TRL's resource allocation, Telstra management has acknowledged that it does demonstrate that there is a movement of the research focus into new areas, particularly in the broadband, multimedia and content areas. These were the areas that the Gungahlin broadband project in its original form was going to deliver, but somehow Telstra has found the justification to move away from that investment in hardware and infrastructure, which has really been at the backbone of their developmental and innovative areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to this issue about research and development, there is a report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia and the Knowledge Economy</EMPHASIS>, which is from the Centre for Strategic Economic Studies. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we conclude that there is a powerful body of evidence linking increased levels of investment in business research and development to increased exports.</PARA>
<PARA>So this really begs the question about the relevance of R&amp;D investment. What is the relevance? We know that there is a significant relevance of growth generally, in terms of growth of jobs and in terms of growth of exports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As highlighted in the majority report, this fact exposes the reduction in the 150 per cent tax concession to 125 per cent&mdash;which was a decision by this government&mdash;for the flawed policy that it really is. This conclusion demonstrates how it will have the effect of impacting directly upon the potential of exports in Australian industry generally. The same report identifies two scenarios for research <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and development: the first will take us to a minor increase in that ratio between business expenditure and GDP, and the second will take us to a slightly larger expenditure. Both are based on previous assessments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, sadly, this government has taken a backward step in their budget, with cuts to research and development across the board. Another backward step in their pursuit of privatisation of Telstra is the dampening effect that that has placed on the strategic long-term investment of that organisation. Another backward step in their blind ideological assertion is that job shedding is the only way to improve Telstra's competitive edge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A quick snapshot of the effects of deregulation and privatisation of Telecom New Zealand provides a very useful insight as to the potential negative effects on local industry, where employment in electronic manufacturing firms fell by over 40 per cent. There is a real opportunity here to make a public asset really work for the benefit of all Australians, for Australian industry and for innovation. There is no evidence that privatisation will bring about the efficiencies and improved services claimed. Take the blinkers off. Do something practical for the people. Keep Telstra in public hands. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I intend to speak very briefly today. Firstly, I will talk about the Senate inquiry and, secondly, I will touch on the link to environment funding. But I cannot ignore the attack on Professor John Quiggin by Senator O'Chee in his quite inane contribution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator O'Chee's contribution does merit at least a brief look at basically the three themes that he touched on. Firstly, he had a go at Professor Quiggin and, secondly, he made comments about how the only solution for rural Australia is the sale of Telstra. I will leave it to my colleague Senator John Woodley to comment. I simply wish to make the point that the only way we are going to see the significant upgrading required in rural Australia is if we keep Telstra in public hands. Thirdly, he made a comment which I find quite extraordinary, and it seemed to revolve around some spurious argument about <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4495"> this whole thing really being about maintaining union membership. I think that is so extraordinary it does not warrant any further comment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I do have to briefly look at his totally unwarranted attack on Professor Quiggin, and certainly this government's approach to Professor Quiggin depends very much on the issue. In particular, I will refer to a letter Senator John Herron wrote to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> a year or so ago, where he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr John Quiggin's analysis of the problems underlying the health care system . . . should be heeded by all in the debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is the first time that I have seen a respected academic state that the problem is "of a policy process based on fundamentally misconceived assumptions" . . . </PARA>
<PARA>So it obviously depends very much on whether or not Professor Quiggin supports the views of this government as to how they approach his work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only is he well recognised here in Australia and applauded by those of us who are rather more interested in rational economics than economic rationalism; he also has an international reputation. Unfortunately, when he came before the Senate committee, the way he was dealt with by some of those who put questions to him left him feeling that this was not a process that was terribly responsive to the facts. In a personal statement he has since made, he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have previously appeared before a number of parliamentary committees frequently presenting views critical of proposed legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>He gives an example of the legislative entrenchment of the One Nation tax cuts. He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Naturally enough, government members of relevant committees have disagreed with the points I have put forward, and on some occasions have done so quite forcefully. I cannot, however, recall any forum, parliamentary or otherwise, in which behaviour has been comparable to that of some government members of the present Committee. Not only was much of their discussion more characteristic of a school debating society than of a serious discussion of policy, but some of the questions I was asked amounted, in my view, to an implied attempt to impugn me in my professional capacity. On a reading of transcripts of the hearings, it appears that this behaviour was part of a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> consistent and concerted pattern of denigration of all witnesses who criticised any aspect of the proposed legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>Here we have in this chamber today Senator O'Chee continuing this pattern of behaviour. One has to ask why. I will make only one suggestion. It perhaps has something to do with the actual value that this government has put on Telstra. Of all the values we heard of during the committee process, theirs was by far the lowest at $24 billion. While Professor Quiggin put it at $54 billion, there was a range of other suggestions in between that. I can imagine that one of the reasons government senators are so sensitive to Professor Quiggin's remarks and his submission is that he has pointed out that this really is almost a fire sale&mdash;they are certainly selling at a value that is well below any really accurate assessment of what this company is really worth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 21 May this year, the Democrats supported the referral of the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill to the Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts References Committee, of which I am the chair. The Democrats were not convinced that the government had mounted a solid case for selling off one of our most strategic and profitable business assets. On this basis, we felt that additional parliamentary scrutiny of the proposal was warranted, but so too was providing the community&mdash;at this stage left out altogether&mdash;with an opportunity to have a say. The inquiry revealed that there was no substantial empirical evidence to back up the government's assertion that the economy, consumers and the environment would benefit from the proposed sale&mdash;hence, I suspect, the sensitivity of some government senators to witnesses who came before the committee and put those views.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It became clear that the government was and is being driven by little other than sheer ideology. The committee concluded that sound economic and social policy dictates that Telstra should remain in full public ownership. Moreover, the inquiry process revealed the widespread and deep-seated opposition of the community to the government's decision to sell part, let alone all, of Telstra. This has not stopped them trying to ram this ideological agenda through this place.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4496">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Out of sheer desperation, they have had no qualms in turning to blackmail and bribery in the hope of securing support they so desperately want and so desperately require. They have sought to blackmail the Australian people by linking the sale to the funding of their environment policy and to bribe the Australian people by predicating the introduction of a world-class consumer framework on the passage of the sale bill&mdash;hence the motion I moved this morning to attempt to split the two. Rather than winning over the community, these measures have only served, and rightly so, to further damage this government's credibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will now look briefly at the Telstra-environment link. The forced choice between the sale of a public asset, like Telstra, and the protection of part of a public asset, the environment, is simply and purely blackmail. Blackmail is a strong word, but it is the only word that truly describes the false choice with which Australians have been presented. It is the only word which truly describes the strongarm tactics being used by government in its efforts to justify what is extremely poor public policy&mdash;as witnesses time and time again showed as they appeared before the Senate committee. It is the only word which truly describes the actions of a government seeking to coerce the Australian public into accepting decisions and actions which are politically, economically and environmentally irresponsible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The very abhorrence of this link has induced a senior government adviser to speak out in even stronger terms than those that I have used. I think it is worth quoting this adviser, at length, as reported in the October edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Scitech</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are appalled at the lies and the deception involved with this issue, it is an exercise based on just one thing&mdash;finding a way to sell off Telstra. The linkage to the environment is just a sop, designed to cloud the Telstra sale issue and to try to blackmail other parties and the general community into accepting it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Anybody who looks at the figures can quickly see that the Natural Heritage Trust is a blatant and cynical political fraud. There is simply no way the interest from the $1 billion supposedly to be diverted from the Telstra sale could possibly pay <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to rectify the enormous environment problems confronting Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And those who closely follow political debate in Australia will soon see the chasm between the proposed Telstra funding and the Government's own admissions about the extent of those problems. Several senior ministers, including Senator Hill, have publicly declared that these problems are already costing us a minimum of $1.5 billion a year and are rapidly getting worse.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also obvious that the Government's expressed concern for the environment is not in any way matched by its actions in the recent Budget, where funding for the environment was cut, and its flat refusal to consider anything other than the Telstra sale as a means of funding its supposedly crucial Natural Heritage Trust environment program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A lot of the opponents of the Telstra sale have long suggested the Natural Heritage Trust was a cynical political invention and a blackmail device. Some have also suggested it was the creation of Mr Robb [the Federal Director of the Liberal Party]. They have always been correct on both counts, despite the Government's continuing denials. It is time the community was told the truth&mdash;the Natural Heritage Trust is a gigantic and disgusting sham.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>I stress that these comments are not my own; they are a quote from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Scitech</EMPHASIS>  magazine. They come from a senior government adviser, someone who is rightly appalled by this government's hypocrisy, someone who is concerned enough to actually take the risk of speaking out. I praise this person for having the courage and decency to make public what this government's real agenda is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The environment, like any other portfolio, as the Democrats have said time and time again, deserves to be funded in its own right from the federal budget. Imagine the outcry if the government were to come into this place and say, `We can't fund hospitals; we can't give any money to the states for hospitals any longer. We need to sell off Australia Post. Look, we're really sorry about it, but we are having another look at schools and universities. We think we will have to sell off yet another government asset.' The fact is that the sale of assets has no bearing&mdash;and should not have any bearing&mdash;on the government's capacity to afford current expenditure programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4497"> The Treasurer (Mr Costello) knows this, and I remember many occasions when he pointed this out to the previous Labor govern ment which used asset sales to conceal budget deficits and fund recurrent expenditure programs. The importance of this cannot be overemphasised. Australians should not be misled into believing that the government will not be able to afford to meet election commitments on the environment if it does not sell part of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, on the basis of the expert economic advice provided by economists such as Dr Allan Brown and Professor John Quiggin to the Senate committee, the government will be less likely to afford environment funding if it does sell part of Telstra. Perhaps we are now starting to see more of the reasons why Professor Quiggin receives such a hard time from a number of government senators. They really do not like the facts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed sale of one&hyphen;third of Telstra for a mere $8 billion will simply result in a massive transfer of wealth from the public sector to domestic and foreign shareholders in a privatised Telstra. Predicating the availability of funds for the environment on the sale of Telstra is clearly a very short&hyphen;sighted form of blackmail which the Senate would do well to ignore.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also wish to speak in this debate. I am pleased to follow Senator Lees and Senator Lundy, both of whom sat on the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts which inquired into the proposed sale of Telstra. I take this chance to say to both senators that I think the way that committee was run by the chair, and also by the majority of senators, is a great credit to the process of the Senate. I sat with the committee for a very short period, less than a day, but it was quite clear from the time I spent there and from looking at the documentation which came through that the information that the committee managed to draw to it and the evidence that it managed to elicit will be quite critical when any government, party or person makes an assessment of the pros and cons of the Telstra sale.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also wish to say that it should not be on for honest, competent people who come before Senate committees to be treated in the way Professor John Quiggin has been treated <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> by some government members during this process, even as late as this morning. John Quiggin has not just a reputation in Australia for his economic and academic skills; he is also someone who has been recognised internationally for the contribution he has made to economic thought and development. For him to have been dismissed and attacked in the way he has been by members of the government reveals one thing: they are afraid of his ideas. If they were not afraid of his ideas, they would not attack the person. By attacking the person they accentuate the fact that the ideas John Quiggin has proposed time and time again&mdash;sometimes, and quite often, swimming against the flow of economic thought&mdash;are ideas to be listened to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When talking about political correctness, there is no area where it is more pervasive than in the economic debate. The way people attack Professor Quiggin for his unorthodox ideas, sometimes in terms of our domestic debate but also his more orthodox ideas when looking at the world economic community, is a real reflection of where political correctness stinks in this particular parliament. We have to be able to allow people to express their views and we have to be able to respect them. We should not be allowed to criticise them in the personal way that a prominent and eminent Australian such as John Quiggin has been criticised in this process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said earlier, the Senate process has elicited a lot of information and much is on the public record. It has exposed the arguments of the government. Through this process we have seen an array of people come forward with different perspectives on the sale. We have also seen the government and its representatives examined, cross&hyphen;examined and further examined as to their arguments in their evidence. It is fair to say, as the majority of the Senate committee said quite clearly, that the arguments of the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) have been exposed for their shallowness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately for good policy in this country, the work of the Senate committee has met a brick wall of government arrogance and ideology. Why would any rational government look at the evidence elicited by the committee <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4498"> and make an assessment of it and dismiss it in the arrogant, ideological way that this minister has done? Here we are speaking of the most arrogant minister in a government that is fast showing its arrogance and patrician nature to the Australian people. There is an ideological fixation driving this privatisation which I think is very unhealthy. Privatisation should not be a religion; it should be something, the role of which can be acknowledged as relevant in some circumstances and as not relevant in other circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I maintain very strongly, as I have maintained very strongly for a long time, that privatisation does have a role. But it is a role that really depends on what it is that is to be privatised in light of the state of the market and other implications of industry policy. We should not be fixed in our thinking one way or another. We should not be ideologically enjoined one way so that we cannot see that there are particular circumstances that drive us in one direction or another. The fundamental mistake the government is making here is that it is blinded by the religion of privatisation to such an extent that it is not seeing the facts through its ideological blinkers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have always argued that Telstra is one Australian enterprise, one Australian corporation, that we should not sell. As a country, we need to develop our sense of identity. We also need to be recognised internationally, not just for the place that we are but for what we produce. As a country, we do not have any pride in what we produce. Unless we have that, we will be floundering to find ourselves and to have the rest of the world find us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no vehicle more suited to representing us in the region and in the world than a communications carrier. We need large corporations of which to be proud. We need large corporations which are ours and which can be identified as being ours. We need large corporations that have world recognition, as Telstra already has. We need large corporations which provide a vehicle for jobs&mdash;jobs through trade, through overseas contracts, through the skills developed at home because of markets tapped into overseas.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need flag bearers in the region, and Telstra over recent years has developed in such a way that it is most suited to do that. We have had such corporations in the private sector, but not enough of them. We might have BHP, we might have WMC but we do not have enough corporations, particularly at the smart end of the industry&mdash;the technological sector, the industry of the future. That is one reason I would not be inclined to sell Telstra. I oppose very strongly the sale of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing that I find quite offensive about this bill is that this sale, as Senator Lees has said, is part of a con job. It was a con job at the election; it is blackmail now. This whole idea of a Natural Heritage Trust has come from a government which, time and time again, whenever it is confronted with an environmental issue, takes the non&hyphen;environmental side. It takes the side that will lead, for instance, to mining in Kakadu National Park and to all sorts of negative impacts on the Great Barrier Reef.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not talking about a government that has any concern at all for the environment. Whether it be in protecting our natural history, logging or any other aspect of environmental concern, it is all words, no action. We even have an environment minister who has been jumped on by other industry ministers for fulfilling his legal obligations under the legislation passed by this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no legitimate concern by the government about the environment. At the start of the year, when they went for a walk in the forest and they took with them poor innocent souls like Alec Marr, promising the environment would be a nirvana with the sale of Telstra, some people were conned&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it offensive that an Australian icon like Telstra has been traded for environmental votes when the economics of it make it quite clear that the government would be better equipped to protect both the environment and industry were they not to sell Telstra and thereby reduce its capacity to reap tax through this great corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to place on the record Professor John Quiggin's qualifications because I think they are important. As I said earlier, the government is attacking a person because they cannot attack his ideas. John Quiggin is a Senior Fellow of the Centre for Economic Research at ANU. In 1993 the Academy of Social Sciences awarded him their annual medal for excellence. They described him as a `major commentator on Australian economic policy, regarded as amongst the best half dozen research economists in the country'. He also works at the James Cook University in Townsville. That is the person whose ideas have been dismissed on the basis of an ideological fixation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do you sell? As I have said, I do not agree with the sale and I do not agree with what the government is trying to achieve. What is the gain? What is the efficiency gain, the economic gain? One of the most telling aspects of the Senate committee's report goes to that particular issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much of the popular case for the privatisation of Telstra rests on a suggestion that Telstra is underperforming in public ownership. In particular, the ideologues on the other side are claiming that its cost structure, and particularly its staffing levels, are below world's best practice. They come in here, blind to the facts, blind to reality&mdash;as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has been in recent days about his ministers who cannot fill out forms&mdash;arguing one thing when the facts show another.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 13 September, Telstra announced a profit after tax, abnormals and minority interest, of over $2.3 billion for the financial year ended 30 June 1996. On the day that these massive profits were announced the business editor Alan Kohler announced on the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> that Telstra's unit cost per line was below the average of world telecommunication companies for the first time. Kohler commented:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They are 8% below the average of the world and they are planning now to stay there.</PARA>
<PARA>Kerry O'Brien asked him:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So would partial privatisation force greater efficiency on Telstra?</PARA>
<PARA>Kohler's response was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, that's already happening. That's the point.</PARA>
<PARA>Such a comment from a respected local business analyst is, to me, much more persuasive than the rantings of an arrogant minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point is quite fundamental: competition is critical here, not privatisation. Competition is what the previous government brought into the communications sector. Competition has lead to the advances and improvements across the board in so much of Telstra's operations, and it will be the critical feature of future improvements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Competition is quite critical here. Competition has led to the outcomes that I have just mentioned. Ian Martin from BZW gave evidence to the Senate committee inquiring into the sale. He said, referring to Telstra's performance, that against a range of benchmarks, Telstra stacks up very well against overseas companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is in every indicator you look at. Pre&hyphen;tax return on capital for Telstra is 22 per cent; world best practice is just over 20 per cent. Telstra's interest cover for 1993&hyphen;94 was 5.3 times; world best practice is over 5.5 times. Its debt ratio was 35 per cent in 1993&hyphen;94; world best practice is 35 per cent. Telstra's return on average equity in 1993&hyphen;94 was 18 per cent and world best practice is just over 17 per cent. It is in every aspect you want to look at, including credit ratings. In terms of credit ratings, Telstra's are amongst the highest of any major Australian company, and they have enabled Telstra to access low&hyphen;cost borrowing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are talking here about a major source of federal government revenue. We are talking here about a company which in the 1994&hyphen;95 financial year paid a dividend of $944 million. It also paid a tax of $649 million to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4500"> the federal government. In 1995&hyphen;96, Telstra paid a dividend to the government of $1.638 billion. It paid tax of over $1 billion. That is $2&half; billion. Telstra does not minimise tax payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth noting, and is a sobering thought here, that any privatised Telstra is likely to minimise its tax payments substantially. Any such minimisation will place this government in a worse position to fund its environmental hopes. I only have about six minutes to go and I probably could go for a few more hours on this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are embarking upon this course for no good economic reason and no good economic outcome. We are embarking upon it for an ideological fixation of the government. If there was no competition in the marketplace, then you would have to look at the role of Telstra and how you would maximise its performance and its return to government and to the people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have got competition here. That has been the great advance over recent years. That was something that the previous government was quite keen to ensure. We always recognised that Telstra had a role to play not just as a source of revenue to government but also an organisation which had to be consumer friendly and was quite critical for a number of reasons in terms of the future of this society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Industry policy cannot be divorced from the operations of Telstra. It has not been in the past; it should not be in the future. We are talking here about an organisation that spends millions and millions of dollars on its research, its development and its industry policy. We are talking about an organisation which has led the way in respect of locally produced equipment and exports overseas. If Australia is to develop a secure jobs base here for Australians living and working in this country, then we need to ensure that the sorts of inroads that Telstra has made into the communications market&mdash;and we are on the doorstep of the biggest communications market in the world&mdash;can be built on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The other thing that concerns me in this debate is the question of communications being the road of transport interaction be tween people and their interaction with the broader community of the future.

We need to ensure that we do not draw a very clear line between those who do have access and those who do not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you tap into the Internet these days, you have access to a whole host of information. The kids going through school at the moment who have got access to Internet have a major advantage over those who do not. We have to ensure that the technology is there for a universal information and communications superhighway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to ensure that people living in outlying parts of Australia do not miss out. In my state of South Australia, for instance, we have to ensure that the community service obligation applies to the benefit of those country electorates which they on the other side purportedly represent and that people there do not miss out&mdash;people living in places like Coober Pedy, Thevenard and Port Augusta and outlying areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have to ensure that money is not a barrier to access to information, because that will be the new poverty line. If you cannot access the Internet, technology or the standard telephone service in a way provided cheaply by the provider and also without delay, then you will be deprived of full rights of participation in the society of the future.     <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has treated this issue with disdain. No&hyphen;one in the seventies would have argued that the universal service function had been achieved in that time. No&hyphen;one in the eighties would have argued it. No&hyphen;one in the early nineties would have argued that the universal service obligation had been achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a minister who is insensitive to the role of Telstra as a guarantee of access to services. He is a minister who claimed that we actually achieved all we needed to achieve in terms of universal service by the seventies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Technology has moved on in the last 25 years. Capacity has changed in terms of delivery of service and the services available to people. But Senator Alston draws the line <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4501"> and says everything we needed to achieve in terms of access of services was achieved in the 1970s.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He cares not one iota about the impact on revenue, he cares not one iota in terms of impact on service delivery, he cares not one iota in terms of ensuring that Australians have rights of access to the communications system of the future.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It evidences that once again we see, on behalf of the government, another minister who is not on top of his portfolio. We see it time and time again. I think the unfortunate thing for Australia is that slowly people are waking up to the fact that when they did make a change of government on 3 March, and did take a risk, it was a pretty big risk because minister after minister is showing consistency. There is a common bond across the government. They do not understand their portfolios, they do not understand detail and they do not care about either.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill will inject private capital into Telstra. It will make Telstra more competitive. It will make sure that Telstra regains its community service obligations. It will pay off some $7 billion of ALP accumulated debt. It will spend $1.15 billion on a heritage trust to improve our environment. This is a bill which we should support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of hares have been set running and a few fibs have been told. Let me put <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> some of these to rest. Firstly, I will refer to the consequences for industry development and research. It is clear that Australian telecommunications equipment and service suppliers will not be adversely affected by the partial privatisation of Telstra. In fact, it is likely that the bill and the post&hyphen;1997 arrangements will actually stimulate the development of the telecommunications service and equipment industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Contrary to ALP claims, passage of the bill will not affect the government's current industry plan arrangements, which have actually proven successful in stimulating the telecommunications supplier industry. Under these arrangements, Telstra and the other carriers have to produce industry development plans that outline the basis of commercially based relationships with suppliers. That is aimed at promoting long-term strategic relationships between the carriers on the one hand and the suppliers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The success of these arrangements to date is very clearly measurable not only for Telstra but also for its competitors, Optus and Vodafone. According to a range of sources, those plans have been responsible for encouraging carriers to source roughly 70 per cent of their equipment and software requirements locally. That averages out at about $2.8 billion every year. It is nonsense to suggest that the partial privatisation will erode the practical value of the industry plan arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is borne out by an examination of the performance of the two currently privately owned carriers, Optus and Vodafone, under their development plans. In the 1994&hyphen;95 year, they both achieved significantly higher Australian content than Telstra. Optus got 76 per cent and Vodafone got 71 per cent compared with Telstra's 65 per cent. These figures just go to show that maintaining 100 per cent government ownership of Telstra provides no guarantee that Telstra will be more geared towards using Australian products or suppliers than if it were partially privatised. During the recent Senate inquiry, the Australian telecommunications industry association stated its belief that:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4502">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . on the basis of a continuation of the present successful approach of recognising a close nexus between communications and industry policy, the partial privatisation of Telstra will not affect the Australian telecommunications industry.</PARA>
<PARA>The investment bankers BZW&mdash;highly regarded bankers&mdash;pointed out in that same inquiry:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Telstra as a publicly owned company should be no more or less benevolent than Telstra as a privately owned company to Australian equipment manufacturers, but rather treat them on their merits. Industry support arrangements . . . should be the same in both cases . . . </PARA>
<PARA>BZW also commented:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Improved efficiencies between Telstra [as a result of privatisation] may flow on to a more efficient Australian services and equipment industry, increasing its prospects for competing with overseas companies.</PARA>
<PARA>We believe that continuation of the industry plan arrangements, combined with open entry of carriers into the marketplace after 1997, is easily the best way to stimulate the Australian telecommunications supply industry. The ALP claimed it would not be commercially viable for Telstra to use Australian suppliers but, as Telstra itself pointed out, there is little likelihood that the commercial incentives for maintaining mutually advantageous relationships with local sourcing would in any way diminish with partial privatisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the recent Senate inquiry, Telstra stated that it would continue to use Australian telecommunications suppliers after privatisation&mdash;not out of any sense of patriotic duty but because it is in its own commercial interests to do so. There are a number of reasons for why they would prefer local to overseas sourcing. They said that there are shorter supply lead times, reduced transport and handling costs because of proximity, and more timely and more cost&hyphen;effective after&hyphen;sales service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Telstra stated that its partnership with the supply industry, which is formalised in the development plan, is important in meeting the strategic objectives to move into new information and communication services. It also saw its links with suppliers may enable some firms to expand overseas and foster greater innovation on their part. BZW made similar com ments about two listed Australian equipment companies, AWA and ERG, stating that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Neither company would, in our view, be impacted by a partial privatisation of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA>Let us look at Telstra's record to date. This commitment to the Australian supply industry is more than just rhetoric. Its figures for the 1994-95 plan show that, during that period, Telstra increased its spending on products and services by $794 million to $4.25 billion. Telstra traded with more than 10,000 suppliers, over 50 companies received orders of $10 million&mdash;a 25 per cent increase&mdash;and over 1,000 companies received orders of $400,000 or move. The expenditure on Australian content increased by an average of seven per cent or eight per cent over the last three years and two&hyphen;thirds of all purchases were sourced locally. Australian based suppliers received orders of $224 million for Telstra's offshore operations as $218 million was spent on research and development. Telstra's support for local manufacturing industry employs 13,000 Australians directly and another 20,000 indirectly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about the other carriers&mdash;Optus and Vodafone? They have also built up beneficial alliances with various suppliers under their plan. As I mentioned earlier, these two carriers, both of which are fully privately owned, utilise local suppliers for a greater percentage of their overall requirements than Telstra does.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This preference is not just restricted to current carriers. In the recent inquiry, AAP Telecommunications&mdash;one of the largest service providers which has the option of becoming a carrier after 1997&mdash;stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we can buy from Australian sources, it is absolutely our preferred approach.</PARA>
<PARA>Neither will there be any significant impact on the post&hyphen;1997 industry plan arrangements. There will be no change to the current arrangements for industry plans. They work very well and they will be continued. It is the government's intention that such arrangements will be retained for all carriers including Telstra, Optus, Vodafone and any new carriers coming into the market, including those involved with broadband cable networks.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4503">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The draft post&hyphen;1997 package released for public comment already includes those provisions. The Telecommunications Industry Development Authority has monitored those plans and, post&hyphen;1997, the government will ensure that the plans continue to be monitored. It is the carriers' commercial operations after 1997 which will determine their purchase of local equipment and services. Expenditure levels are expected to remain high over the next year or two in particular as carriers continue to roll out their cable networks. The local carrier network is, and will continue to be, the base for the Australian telecommunications supply industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> What about research and development? There have been all sorts of distortions put out about R&amp;D. The bottom line is that there is no evidence that the partial privatisation of Telstra should or will reduce the expected expenditure which Telstra currently makes on research and development. In fact, there are reasons to expect that the current level will be either maintained or even increased.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra, as an efficient part&hyphen;privatised provider of telecommunications services in Australia and in overseas markets, will be expected to utilise the latest and the best technology available for its commercial needs. Nobody has ever suggested that Telstra expenditure on research and development is done for altruistic reasons. It is undertaken because Telstra needs to respond to changes in technology use, consumer demands for new and better services and the new or improved technology resulting from this research that provides a very direct financial return to Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We would expect a part&hyphen;privatised Telstra to make decisions on R&amp;D spending based on the commercial return it expected to receive on that spending, just as it does now. Decisions on how it meets its R&amp;D needs&mdash;in-house or through contracting out&mdash;are properly made by the Telstra board and management. The Senate majority report noted that the wholly government owned Telstra currently spends some 0.5 per cent of its income on R&amp;D. That is in comparison with the OECD average of 1.2 per cent of GDP. In fact, Telstra expenditure at 0.5 per cent of revenue <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is some 28 per cent below Australia's ratio of business expenditure on research and development of 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> As an aside, it is worth noting that the Japanese carrier, Nippon Telephone and Telegraph&mdash;NTT&mdash;spends 4.7 per cent of its revenue on R&amp;D. I am sure that senators would be aware that NTT is in fact 37 per cent privately owned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1994-95 Telecommunications Industry Development Authority report indicates that Optus, at the end of year 3, had already well exceeded its five-year R&amp;D undertakings. The evidence is there are many wholly or partly privatised telecommunications companies and organisations around the world that spend more on research and development than Telstra. This makes it difficult to believe that a partially privatised Telstra would neglect research opportunities, when a wholly private company such as Optus is expending even more on R&amp;D than planned. Why? Because of the direct commercial benefit from this expenditure. In the election the coalition pledged to retain the requirement for existing carriers to submit industry development plans and to expand this to all carriers post&hyphen;1997. An important part of those plans is the R&amp;D aspect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Let me turn to some other issues and look for a moment at the hypocrisy of the ALP. A few minutes ago we had Senator Bolkus talking about Telstra as an Australian icon, implying that we should not privatise Telstra because it is an icon. Let me ask him about those other icons such as Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank. A number of other companies and organisations were also privatised by the former Labor government, including Australian Airlines, the Federal Airports Corporation, AIDC, ANL, defence home loans and the Sydney to Moomba pipeline&mdash;the list is endless.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only that but it is clear from a number of historic recordings that the ALP wanted to privatise Telstra itself. There were different views within the ALP about how they should go. On the one hand, there was a view that they should privatise it as a whole lot. That was certainly Paul Keating's view at the time. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4504"> On the other hand, there was a suggestion that they might privatise the profitable parts, and in particular people were looking at selling off the Yellow Pages. So bit by bit Telstra would have been privatised. That is an indication of the ALP's hypocrisy when it privatised everything it could lay its hands on. There was not much that actually avoided their privatising zeal when they were in government. But then suddenly after 2 March they take a holier&hyphen;than&hyphen;thou approach and say, `How dare you privatise what Senator Bolkus called an Australian icon.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have given some of the reasons why we need to privatise the icon. But let me also look at some of the less direct reasons, such as the impact on the environment. As the Senate would know, expenditure on the environment will rapidly increase as a result of this partial privatisation. An amount of $1.15 billion dollars will go to an environmental heritage trust called the Natural Heritage Trust. I might point out immediately that this is in addition to the current expenditure on the environment. It is not in place of and it is not an alternative source of funding. This is extra money for the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are we going to do with that $1.1 billion? An amount of $318 million will go to a revegetation initiative. This will be looking at land and water degradation in particular. An amount of $163 million will go to fixing up the problems of the Murray-Darling Basin. There are a number of farmers in that area who desperately see the need not just for themselves but for the whole of Australia for this project to be undertaken. An amount of $32 million will go towards a national land and water resources audit and $80 million will be allocated to preserve biodiversity. On top of that, an amount of $300 million will be kept in trust in perpetuity. It is a trust that will be used for a number of environmental projects, not just for us but for future generations. This is a very far-sighted, outreaching program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> At the end of that, there is still another $7 billion or thereabouts which will be used to retire debt&mdash;to pay off debt accumulated by the Labor Party. How on earth can the Labor Party rail against getting rid of the debt that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> they single-handedly&mdash;and single-mindedly, I might add&mdash;managed to raise?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Concerns have been raised by the ALP and the Democrats about the role of Telstra employees. My phones and the phones of many other members and senators have been running hot with calls from Telstra employees who wanted to participate in this partial privatisation. Up to two per cent of the float will be allocated to Telstra employees. This is another way of involving Telstra employees in their own company, of enhancing the pride which many of them already have in their company and of involving them in the process of running Telstra and making it more competitive than it is at present.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The spectre of foreign ownership has been raised as a scare campaign of the sort that we are used to from the other side. They have been saying that Telstra will be taken over by foreign moguls who are tucked away in overseas countries and have no concern about the future of Australia. The facts put the lie to this sort of comment. Some 1.667 per cent, a minuscule amount, of Telstra will be allowed to be in foreign hands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Essentially, what will happen will be that the ownership of Telstra will remain in Australia. Australian mums and dads and employees and Australian companies will actually participate in the float of a third of Telstra. In addition, the chairperson of Telstra will be an Australian, the head office of Telstra will be in Australia, the majority of the directors will be Australian and, in terms of the service provisions, there will be penalty clauses in the legislation, which we have called a customer service guarantee, to make sure that some of the services which are offered by Telstra are delivered. The service provision of Telstra will be reinforced by this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These hares that have been running are without any substance. The fact is that there is no doubt that this bill will enhance the running of Telstra and will provide a significant benefit to the Australian environment and our economy by retiring debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will look for a second at the position of the Democrats. They claim that they have a mandate to `keep the bastards honest'&mdash;I <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4505"> think that is the expression. They are forgetting a couple of things. The first is that what they are doing is keeping the bastards&mdash;if the bastards are the government&mdash;dishonest because we were elected on a very firm mandate with Telstra as a key pivotal plank in our election platform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The overwhelming majority that we obtained in the House of Representatives indicates that the Australian public wants not only the privatisation of a third of Telstra but also the associated benefits that come with it. The opposition claims that it has some sort of mandate to stop us doing this. Separate from the fact that this was a part of our plank, add to that the fact that only something like 10 per cent of the population voted for the Democrats&mdash;a very small minority compared with the overwhelming majority who voted for the coalition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the numbers for the last election. This is a slightly different aspect to that raised previously. In the Senate in March, 40 senators were up for election. Of the 40, 20&mdash;that is, 50 per cent&mdash;were coalition senators. Only 14&mdash;and I hate to remind those opposite of this&mdash;out of the 40 were ALP senators, only five were Democrat senators and one was a Green senator. We actually got 50 per cent of the senators up for election in March. I do not see how you can call that a mandate to oppose the legislation when it was broadly supported not only in Senate voting but also in the House of Representatives where we have a majority of some 40 seats or thereabouts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will be very interesting to see how much support the Democrats get for their position on this particular bill and other bills. Their general position is to stir the matter up. They persist in their role as the `Laborcrat Party' rather than the Democrats. They are out to the left even of the left wing of the Labor Party. The Labor Party is rapidly becoming the centralist party, much to the despair of some of its followers, because the Democrats have taken up the position on the left wing and are pushing them towards the middle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will be very interesting to see what the by-election in Lindsay tomorrow does to the Democrat vote. It will be interesting to see <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> what happens to the Labor vote as well. In this regard, let us see how much popular support there is for the difficult position of opposition for opposition's sake that the Democrats have taken over the last few months. I suspect that the by-election in Lindsay will result in a resounding thump in the face of the Democrats and they will be lucky if they even reach double figures. Time will tell.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the meantime, let me say to the Senate that this is an important bill not only in what it does for Telstra but also in what it does for the environment. We should all support this bill as strongly as possible.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is for good reason that Labor will vote against the sale of Telstra. It is for good reason that Labor supports the findings of the majority report of the Telstra inquiry. The findings included that Telstra should remain in full public ownership so that it may continue its nation building role not only in the delivery of services but also in the stimulus its presence as an employer gives to regional economic development. Secondly, public interest in creating and retaining employment in Australia, especially in regional areas, should be given due weight in Telstra's organisational decisions. The committee particularly opposes decisions contained in Project Mercury documents which would see Telstra operations relocated offshore in the name of efficiency. Thirdly, Telstra's employment levels should be determined on the basis of operational needs rather than head count targets. Fourthly, Telstra operations should be resourced to a level that allows for ongoing improvements in customer service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor believes that Telstra must stay totally in public hands. It is the only way to ensure that what has already contributed to building the nation continues to build the nation. Telstra is a highly successful company as its $2.3 billion in profits this year indicate. At the same time, it offers a unique service. Despite Australia's geography and demography it provides an affordable communications service on a universal basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a government enterprise, it has balanced its commercial objectives against other social <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4506"> goals. Public ownership is the only way that these social goals can be guaranteed. As overseas experience shows, public ownership is the only way that important community service obligations can be maintained. The government often cites the sale of British Telecom as an example of a successful privatisation of a telecommunications company, but many local British consumers would have a very different viewpoint. A 1993 report by the UK National Consumer Council found:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Charges in services to domestic users have risen over the years relative to charges for services used mainly by business customers.</PARA>
<PARA>Thus, under a privatised service, cheap rate local calls, which are used mainly by domestic consumers, rose 27 per cent while peak rate local, national and long distance calls, which are mainly used by businesses, reduced substantially. As well, the cost of calls made from public payphones increased dramatically after British Telecom was sold.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another often quoted example of private sector efficiency is Bell Atlantic. This company serves a market of 19 million lines on the east coast of America. It is a large telecommunications company with revenue of some $18 billion. In search of greater profit for the period 1992 to 1994, they cut 1,600 employees from their payroll. Access lines per employee rose from 288 in 1992 to 310 in 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of these changes, service quality dropped significantly, with their repeat trouble report rate rising sharply. In fact, it quadrupled over the period of job reductions. The repeat trouble report rate is the main measure of customer satisfaction. It records the number of times a customer has to follow up an initial fault before it is fixed. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor believes that public ownership of Telstra is about more than just making money; it is about ensuring equity and affordability in the provision of key services. At the centre of that access and affordability has been Telstra's role in ensuring that all Australians, wherever they reside or carry on business, will continue to have reasonable access on an equitable basis to both standard telephone services and an array of benefits that new technology delivers.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Few in the community believe that this social and policy goal will survive privatisation. The recently reconstituted board has been carefully chosen to facilitate a profit driven culture within Telstra in preparation for privatisation. In the government's view of a privatised Telstra, the third of Telstra's board legally responsible to the private shareholders will clearly have maximum profits as their priorities&mdash;not cross&hyphen;subsidisation or expanded services to the needy. Cross-subsidisation is crucial for this country because of our widely dispersed population, and it ensures that rural Australians have cheap access to the public network at what, historically, have been uniform prices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cost of this service is substantial. As indicated in Telstra's 1994-95 total losses from loss making exchanges, it was a massive $238.5 million. But this substantial figure greatly understates the full extent of cross-subsidies involved in current service delivery. For example, Telstra is required by law to provide service connection for all customers, irrespective of geographic location. For this service alone, Telstra sustains losses of some $170 million a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure this fact is not lost on the many National Party supporters who are currently concerned about the prospects of a withdrawal of Telstra from regional Australia. Earlier this week, several prominent rural women met with the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and expressed concerns about the effects of the sale on rural Australia. Mrs Jean Tom, a Victorian farmer, was reported on page 6 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 16 October 1996 as saying that there were concerns that the efficiency of telecommunication links in rural areas would not be kept up to scratch, leading to higher costs</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4507"> The Telstra inquiry report reinforced this view. It found that privatisation efficiencies resulted in the centralisation of services in Sydney and Melbourne, reduced cross&hyphen;subsidies worth some $9.2 million to Telstra's Tasmanian operations, the relocation of operator assistance services to overseas locations, and the reduction in customer service centres, which are a key source of employment in regional centres. The govern ment has made much of its continued universal service obligation guarantees, but already we have had ample evidence of how this government delivers on its guarantees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These guarantees and promises have a very limited lifespan&mdash;ask the staff at the ABC. Section 8CM in the proposed new part 2C of the act ties the universal obligation to what should be fulfilled as efficiently and economically as practicable. This is hardly a solid assurance when we put it in the context of private rather than public ownership. An obligation on the investment considerations of a private company becomes whatever is practicable and economically acceptable to the private shareholders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What will this obligation mean for remote communities where private providers may consider the cost of providing the service to be too excessive? Clearly, in the long term, private carriers will be either unwilling or unable to sustain cross-subsidisation. Current community service obligations will be abandoned by the provider in a competitive, deregulated environment and will only be paid at the discretion of the government of the day. They become a budget item and Mr Costello, or his successor, will decide what breadth and quality of service the government is willing to pay for from year to year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> That should provide some interesting tests of the beliefs of the National Farmers Federation in the merits of privatisation. The difficulties of expanding the definition of the universal service obligation will be increased by privatising Telstra. In the past, remote, rural and many Aboriginal communities have suffered substantial disadvantage associated with isolation. The previous Labor government recognised this inequity and foreshadowed a possible expansion of the universal service obligation from a standard telephone service to a standard telecommunications service capable of supporting fax, data and telephony.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new government is also committed to examining the possibilities of upgrading the definition. Such an upgrade would substantially improve the quality of life for many in rural and remote communities by accessing new services, but would reduce substantially <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the profitability of the organisation and reduce share prices. It is not surprising that the government is hedging its bets on this one. It has gone for a minimalist definition of the standard of service in its new legislation, confining it to voice telephony. But it has left the door open for an extension of the USO by adding in other prescribed services that might have to be delivered. Right now, as the draft stands, all Telstra has to commit to is the status quo&mdash;hardly a great leap forward into the information age.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Of particular odium is the government's linking of the sale of Telstra to their environmental promises. This ploy, designed to win over the green movement, has failed. It has failed not only because it is in principle wrong to link two distinctly different agendas but, more importantly, because most environmentalists realise that a publicly owned Telstra with ongoing profits&mdash;expected to rise by 18 per cent a year&mdash;will contribute far more to the environment in the long term than a quick fire sale today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Questions need to be asked about the coalition's ongoing commitment to environmental programs. Will they use the profits from their planned sale of the other two&hyphen;thirds of Telstra to fund future environmental programs? What happens when the Telstra piggy bank is sold?  Will they then turn to other assets, such as Australia Post?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should not trade off the further enhancement of a national infrastructure and the telecommunications sector for the price of programs to conserve our national heritage. Good government is about balancing and reconciling equal priorities. We the Australian people have the right to hold onto our precious national assets. We deserve a sustainable, natural environment, a world&hyphen;class and affordable telecommunications service and a parliament that protects all Australians equally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor believes that the government's case for privatisation of Telstra is based on rhetorical and ideological arguments rather than on empirical evidence. Telstra is already a highly successful company, as its record $2.3 billion profit this year indicates. Its financial performance is equal to that of its international <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4508"> peers. At the same time, it provides a unique service. Despite the difficulties presented by Australia's geography and demography, Australian society has one of the highest levels of telephone access in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra has played an important role in nation building through the provision of affordable communications services on a universal basis. It has pioneered research and development of international importance and has been a leader in the introduction of technologies such as ISDN and fibre optics. It has played a critical role in the growth of the Australian electronics industry. At the same time, as one of the country's largest employers, it has provided job opportunities throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra has performed this role because, as a government enterprise, it has been required to balance commercial objectives against other social goals. Labor believes that any privatisation of Telstra will weaken the government's ability to use Telstra as a vehicle for both nation building and the pursuit of a democratic communications policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What will be the impacts? At risk in any privatisation of Telstra are: access to advanced communications services; service availability, quality and price; public sector finances; Australian ownership; employment; and local manufacturing. Labor considers that these risks, especially that of majority foreign ownership, are heightened by the fact that the government clearly intends to sell all of Telstra over time, about which the minister let the cat out of the bag the other week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra is currently 100 per cent Australian owned and all Australians share in the benefits of that ownership. Its profits remain in Australia and are either redistributed by government or reinvested, chiefly in the national network. Privatisation would concentrate these profits in the hands of a few, to the detriment of the many. It would also allow a substantial portion of Telstra's profits to be sent out of Australia altogether.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Privatisation would rob the public sector of a major revenue stream. I would note that on current performance Telstra's profits over the next three years will equal the $8 billion the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government expects to gain from the one&hyphen;third sale of the company. Depending on the government's dividend policy, Telstra could pay $8 billion in dividends over the next six to seven years. This year's dividend alone would provide the $1 billion earmarked for the National Heritage Fund. Labor consider that the sale of such a high performing asset makes no economic sense, especially as Telstra finances its own capital expansion, has no debt to the Commonwealth and has a negligible amount of Commonwealth guaranteed debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor views with concern Telstra's plans to initiate large&hyphen;scale job reductions in preparation for privatisation. Twenty&hyphen;three thousand Australian workers are to be displaced, either through direct reductions or contracting out. Many of these job losses will be in regional and rural areas. Details of project Mercury, revealed in the Senate report, show that these reductions are being driven by the desire to meet certain head count targets rather than through actual changes in Telstra's operational needs. Labor condemns these attempts to sacrifice Australian jobs in order to make Telstra more attractive to private investors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor notes with particular concern Telstra's plans to cut staffing levels at the Telstra Research Laboratories, TRL, by 44 per cent over the next four years. Such cuts represent a serious threat to the future viability of TRL, which is currently the leading telecommunications research centre in  Australia and the largest in the Southern Hemisphere. They pose a question as to the extent of Telstra's ongoing commitment to research and development and thus to Australia's ability to maintain a critical mass of research expertise in this central industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor also regards Telstra's proposal to close its manufacturing operations at East Bentleigh as a further blow to employment in Victoria. Labor supports the campaign of the CEPU to prevent this closure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What will be the impact on services? Labor considers that  the privatisation of Telstra will confer no certain benefits on Australian consumers and will expose them to many uncertainties. The large&hyphen;scale labour shedding which Telstra is proposing must put severe <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4509"> strains on the company's capacity to maintain service standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Privatisation will also increase the pressure on the range of cross&hyphen;subsidies which underpin the current universal service regime. Labor believes that it is already Telstra's view that any non&hyphen;commercial obligations on Telstra should be funded from the federal budget. Privatisation will strengthen the push for such measures, leaving rural and regional consumers at the mercy of the budget cycle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why are we having this debate? Why is the government so hell&hyphen;bent on selling off one of Australia's greatest companies? Is there an economic argument? Many attempts have been made by the government and its stooges to quote international studies, such as the 1992 World Bank report: <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Privatisation&mdash;lessons of experience</EMPHASIS>. This report refers to some 6,800 privatisations; 4,500 of these were in the former German Democratic Republic; 6,100 were in Eastern Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As examples of the benefits accruing from privatisation, the study pointed to a previously near moribund textile company in Niger, a finance company in Swaziland and an agro&hyphen;industrial enterprise in Mozambique. Just 170 of the privatisations examined by this report occurred in OECD countries. Despite this, the Department of Communications and the Arts submission described the World Bank report as `perhaps the most compelling overall review of the effects of privatisation and relationship with liberalisation'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other supporters of the sale were reduced to quoting from studies such as the Polish cement and lime sector, Odessa meat, the Swarzedz Furniture Company in Poland, the Trinidad and Tobago Methanol Company, textiles in Tunisia&mdash;</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can Telstra be compared with Odessa meat, textile companies in Tunisia, or Russian or East German companies? How has Telstra been performing? Much of the popular case for the privatisation of Telstra rests on suggestions that Telstra is underperforming in public ownership. In particular it is claimed that its cost structures and its staffing levels are below world best practice. Yet, on 13 September, Telstra announced a profit after tax, abnormals and minority interests of $2.305 billion for the financial year ended on 30 June 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the day these massive profits were announced, business editor Alan Kohler said on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> that Telstra's unit costs per line are now below the average of the world's telecommunication companies for the first time. Kohler commentated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . they're 8 per cent below the average of the world and they're planning now to stay there.</PARA>
<PARA>So there is no reputable, comparable economic studies to support the government's case. So I ask again: why?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does not take long when you look through the donors to the coalition in the last election to see who will be the beneficiaries. It will not be ordinary Australians, that is for sure. It will be the spivs and the paper shufflers who make up the Liberal Party branches and attend their $1,000 a head lunches and diners. This is just like the gun advertising tender&mdash;a fix for their mates. We are going to be hearing more about both of these issues over the next few weeks in the chambers and in the estimates hearings.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the debate today on the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill, Senator Woods mentioned the idea of keeping people honest. It is one of those views I have never subscribed to because I believe that, if it were the case that people were not honest, then the best we can do in a political sense is keep them accountable. It is my view that the sale of Telstra takes us one further step away from keeping government accountable for the provision of services such as the important services we are talking about today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The name of the bill is very well chosen in my belief. The primary issue here is precisely <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4510"> that the public ownership is being irrevocably diluted. The secondary issue is that consolidation of global oligopoly is being increased. I am going to provide briefly here some of the background that usually does not get delivered in these kinds of debates. I will continue to do it to give a picture of what is happening in reality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Globally, we do not have increased competition; we have increased consolidation of wealth, ownership and economic power. This has happened especially since the 1980s, when the major deregulation of the financial markets occurred. That was in preparation for the Uruguay Round of GATT in many cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prior to that time, transnationals were still partially bound to work within national economies. Companies like Alcoa&mdash;the aluminium company of America&mdash;General Motors and so on had to set up national subsidiaries such as Alcoa Australia, GM Holden and so on. Today they do not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, we have seen the rise of international competition for investment. This means that we do not have companies competing for investment; we have nations competing for investment. Competition is based on increased corporate profit. This does not serve consumers or national interests, in my opinion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Monopoly practice is when vertical integration&mdash;ownership from resource extraction to retail sale&mdash;shifts to horizontal integration; that is, the ownership of alternative and associated industries. There is a new term, however&mdash;coopetition. This was coined, I believe, by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>. Coopetition is a cartel by any other name.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer to a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> article from Monday, 30 September 1996 entitled `Competition is dead. Long live co-petition!' written by Colleen Ryan from Washington. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Bill Gates didn't start it, but he is one of its most successful exponents.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .       . . .      . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The alliance between Bill Gates's software manufacturer, Microsoft, and Andy Groves's chip maker, Intel, is a classic example of the concept.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .       . . .      . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The justifications for these new alliances range from&mdash;  <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>and this has been starting for a long time, I must say&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"People can't do it on their own anymore" to "It's just too tough out there in the competitive world". Or "It's a natural consequence of the new technology, particularly in telecommunications&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>does that ring a bell with anybody?&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">which requires such huge levels of investment". Or "It is the outcome of the extreme levels of specialisation required these days".</PARA>
<PARA>The article also states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The information superhighway has spawned a number of alliances&mdash;the argument being that no single company can afford to build and operate something so complex.</PARA>
<PARA>So we have a globalisation trend. It is primarily job cutting globally. It eliminates national regional services. It eliminates competition. It is, in fact, inefficient.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The result is a minimalist structure which plays to the lowest denominator mass market or to the heaviest user. That could be, as it seems to be very quickly turning out in Australia, business users as opposed to private users or regional and rural users. It presents the highest return option globally. Whatever the act is that presents the highest return or the greatest assurances of high returns is what the corporation does.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Effectively, this is part of the concentration of wealth. Many large global corporations have bigger annual budgets than the budgets of many nations. It is fundamental control of resources through market dominance. This allows companies to determine the cost and the availability of goods and services including information and culture, which have become commodified. All of these things become commodities that you can just buy and sell, like everything else. Football teams as well; you can buy and sell entire sports through this level of commoditisation. Of course, along with that you have your communications networks. That is what allows you to do this buying and selling of sports. This is part of what we are seeing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While theoretically it is possible to be competitive, effective systems of interpersonal communication are natural monopolies. Internationally, in the presence of global consolidation of broadcast communication of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4511"> news and entertainment, the establishment of alternative information and cultural outlets of production is extremely difficult and the barriers to market entry are immense. What is necessary for network infrastructure in telecommunications are cables, satellites, Internet linkages, electronic computer communications technology, software technology and financial networking services. In service provision, there are phone and fax services, computer services and broadband services. In the content provision, there are news services, entertainment services, information services; and there are personal services such as e-mail, et cetera, financial services and marketing. It is huge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telecommunications, as you can see, is a heavily linked area. What we see is a vast increase in consolidation in this area. The big players are those like Microsoft, Murdoch and CNN. At this point I refer you to another article, which came from a feature in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, page 33. It is an article by Malcolm Maiden, entitled `Welcome to his new world'. After reading this article, it is hard to escape from the conclusion that the main role of, say, the Murdoch group's newspapers now is to bankroll Murdoch's main game&mdash;and that is the construction of a global electronic network centred on television but embracing on-line interactive programming and services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Globalisation means that, effectively, you must deal with transnational corporations. If you do not use CNN, where do you get your news? So you are actually cutting out competition rather than increasing it. We are looking at the formation of one big corporation. Film, TV production, news production, distribution, marketing, broadcasting services, cable services, news, reviews, phones, fax, computer network services, computer network and communications, technology and software.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Along with those articles on Murdoch was an article indicating that, for something like $3 billion, Murdoch now has become the largest owner of TV stations in the United States. So, whether Australia or the United States, you see these mega&hyphen;corporations that are gaining all the links to the chain. The result is the effective ownership of global <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> news by CNN, and we get an automatic American bias to our media, to the news that we receive&mdash;to that upon which we are able to make our decisions. This gives effective control of entertainment and public information: for example, Fox Warner&mdash;once again, an American bias, globalisation of culture and control of information, attitude and opinion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ownership of telecommunication extends the trend to telephones, cable TVs and computer networks. You can note that we now have e-mail and fax set to displace postal services, other than parcel post delivery. In fact, we will have the privatisation of parcel post, but other areas of mail are now part of those international global networks that can be controlled. Telephone and videophone services are already becoming common through computers connected with broadband cables to the net. Dual digital TV monitors are becoming more common, as are CD sound links. We have increased congruence of information and entertainment, or `infotainment'. It is likely that in the future most postal communications will be by e-mail and fax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We already see newspapers, like the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New York Times</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, and magazines moving on line. Government publications are moving on line, including <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. Ultimately, much of the print media may move to electronic form. The terms of access and the costs of access to network services will be significant. Ultimate control of personal subscription and public communications has huge implications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The media implications are also important. The collapse of national and regional culture is a possibility, as are the collapse of national identity and the collapse of diversity of viewpoints globally funnelled through a few very large corporations for main line profit. Then there is the domination of profit motive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This all might seem far-fetched. But if you think about the fact that we are moving here in Australia as well to privatise the ABC, where do we get the alternative viewpoint to this kind of level of control? For people who do not see what this has to do with the privatisation of Telstra, I am very worried indeed. We might see the end of media as a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4512"> vocation; perhaps the domination of a sound byte mentality and the domination of ratings. We will see a lot of changes. We are seeing, as I say, cutbacks to the ABC proposed&mdash;the elimination of the remaining avenue for some quality thought and differing opinions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This all serves the interests of profit but not the interests of the public. It can only result in further erosion of employment and Australian culture&mdash;and it is tied into telecommunications; it is a global domination of all forms of communication.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To get back to the bill, we have many problems with this bill itself, apart from those very real problems that we see with the current trend towards the privatisation of such an element as Telstra. The public control is immensely important, but the partial sale of Telstra eliminates any ability of government to effectively take an active role in direction of the company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is seeking to reassure people by insisting on the right to special reports through its amendment of the Telstra Corporation Act, but this only allows a minister to demand special financial statements and other information not available to stockholders. The proposed amendments exclude the Commonwealth in Telstra from the requirements in the Corporations Law that would prevent that. The existing general power of the minister to direct Telstra is being removed by item 25 of schedule 1 on page 48.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are implications of privatisation going along with an inadequate national code. That is not in the bill but, once you have changed that, the huge public interest&mdash;as I have mentioned before in talking about the report of Telstra&mdash;is there and obviously glaring us in the face. The fact that the draft codes, which have been released by the government, continue to allow exemption from state and local planning and environmental codes would indicate that these financial pressures are biting already.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government sees any social agenda as in conflict with the private sector and believes the government has no right to reduce their profits by serving public ends. So this government is basically putting profits above public <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ends. Beyond that, the government has perceived the assuring of high profits to global corporations, and hamstringing public interest, as a primary means of improving our economic situation. The fact that many people seem to disagree with that seems to be irrelevant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have all had all sorts of debates about the standard telephone services and untimed local calls. Currently, section 73 of the Telecommunications Act requires an option for untimed local calls for a standard telephone service to be made by Telecom. There is nothing in the act about other telecommunication services or other carriers. No other carriers or service providers are obliged to provide an untimed option.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have problems with the universal service obligation because it only applies a standard telephone service to all people in Australia on an equitable basis. The universal service carrier may not be Telstra necessarily and may be different in different areas, although I cannot imagine this at this point. The fact that there is a Standard Telephone Service Review Group set up now seems to indicate that there is a need to quell the public concern about this. It is certainly not good enough to be rushing into these issues in this way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is nothing in this act which defines what is `local'. There are no restrictions on the cost or availability of the untimed option. There is nothing in this bill about services other than telephones. For all that I mentioned before, it is as if we are living in the 1960s. The committee report highlights this and makes recommendations about non&hyphen;phone services. There is no guarantee that the untimed option be offered on a generally affordable basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The customer service guarantee has been mentioned quite a lot. I want to make it clear that Austel is only allowed to regulate if directed by the minister. Recommendation 22 said that they should be required, and recommendation 23 said that their formulation and development should include consumer representation in determining them on a full voting basis. Recommendation 24 says there should <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4513"> be requirements that the codes be developed within a certain time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will not have Austel after next year. Austel will be absorbed into the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. If people really want to see exactly what impact the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission will have in operating as a so-called independent regulator of telecommunications, especially in providing any sort of guarantee of public interest, I suggest they have a look more closely into what the limitations are about public interest and about exemptions for public interest in relation to the competition policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many recommendations that came through the report, but in the brief time that I have left I want to mention a couple of other issues in relation to telecommunications in general. Telecommunications is an area of major significance. The public network has been described by Stewart Fist of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the basic structure under which democratic communication and conduct of business is carried out. Private ownership of the market infrastructure is not equitable.</PARA>
<PARA>Regulation&mdash;as occurs in the United States to avoid market failure or major dichotomies in power&mdash;must, to be effective, be so sweeping that it precludes competition. Private ownership, in most places where social implications are considered, usually becomes a publicly directed national or regional monopoly. We have not seen any indications here that there is a real desire to make sure that regulations fulfil these roles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telecommunications is changing rapidly and massively in terms of its significance and use. It is becoming the de facto channel for financial exchange and services; information and education services; written communication; and, increasingly, audio and video communication, including entertainment and news services. How dangerous is that for us to jump in like this without thinking through the implications ahead of time?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Who are the likely bidders for Telstra? Apart from the obvious interest of other international telecommunications companies, including foreign government owned provid ers, likely bidders will be computer companies such as IBM, computer network globals such as Microsoft and Netscape, and media and entertainment firms such as Fox&hyphen;Warner, CNN or Time&hyphen;Life. There are issues here about what the system will be and who will determine the rights of competitors and have access and on what terms. These are issues of convergence, and these are issues we have not properly dealt with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the ridiculous connection between the Telstra sale and the environment, the proposal is to use $1 billion to create an environment fund. This fund would result in expenditure in the neighbourhood of $200 million per annum for environment programs over five years. Ten per cent interest on the fund over this time, factoring in drawdown of the principal, would be about $390 million. This would be the sum left over after the expenditure of $1 billion. So the real expenditure would effectively be $600 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, we are getting down to $90 million for 1999. When you link this to the government cutting EPA and cutting environmental labour market programs&mdash;significant LEAP and REEP programs operated through DEETYA&mdash;it indicates that the total commitment to the package of the environment, even if they sold Telstra, would be less than what it is now. The government's environmental package appears to concentrate to a large extent on land and water care. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under public ownership, Telstra has performed superbly. Let me tell you how. Telstra is performing up to world's best practice on pre&hyphen;tax return on investment; it is performing up to world's best practice on interest cover; it is performing up to world's best practice on debt ratio levels; and it is performing up to world's best practice on average equity. Obviously, Telstra is a company that anyone would kill to own&mdash;anyone except the government. However, given Telstra's profitability, I am sure that if this initiative succeeds government members will be lining up to buy shares in Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra has also performed well in my home state of Tasmania. Tasmania's isolation obviously has an effect on our capacity to communicate. Having the phone on should be a right and not a privilege.

All of these things mean absolute disaster for my home state. The recent Access Economics report has predicted that the Tasmanian economy will grow by only 0.7 of half a per cent over the next year. Our unemployment rate remains the nation's highest&mdash;it is currently at 10.7 per cent, seasonally adjusted&mdash;and youth unemployment is a staggering 24.9 per cent.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4515">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is now proposing that Telstra be partially privatised. Let me enlighten the Senate as to how a partial sale will further depress the Tasmanian economy. Telstra currently employs a total of 1,460 people in Tasmania. On 13 September this year, Telstra confirmed that it plans to shed 22,000 jobs nationally. If this cut is implemented across the board, it will mean the loss of some 500 jobs in Tasmania. In addition, many of the remaining positions will be transferred to Melbourne, stripping Tasmania of employment in high value added areas of Telstra. The real number of job losses in Tasmania could end up being closer to 700.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These jobs have been on the line only since the change of government. As Telstra prepares itself for a partial privatisation, Telstra chiefs have said that the jobs need to be cut to make Telstra more competitive. Surely a company recording a profit of $2.3 billion is already competitive. Telstra's wage bill in Tasmania is currently in the order of $51 million. If half the jobs go, half the wages go&mdash;even those on the other side can understand that. The removal of this amount of cash from the Tasmanian economy is something we simply cannot afford.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tony Rundle, the most pathetic Premier our state has ever seen, cannot even see through the blackmail inherent in the promise that Tasmania will receive a lion's share of the Natural Heritage Trust. His eyes are dazzled by the idea of a few lousy dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given what has happened to Tasmania over the last six to eight months, I guess Mr Rundle will clutch at any kind of straw in relation to job creation. He sold his state down the drain, pure and simple. And it is not just economics: there are community service obligations that need to be looked at.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The universal service obligations set out in this bill are not good enough. They are not good enough for Australia, nor for Tasmania. There is no provision for the standard telephone service to include technological advancements such as broadband services and so on. This is despite spurious assurances from Senator Alston that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The extent to which people in rural and remote areas have access to services is obviously critical <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> if they are not to be left behind in keeping up with the latest technologies.</PARA>
<PARA>The likelihood of the universal service obligation being broadened to include these technologies is remote as it would reduce the profitability of Telstra. If you are about making a buck&mdash;and the company is about making a buck, and that is the sole motivation&mdash;then that is logical. It makes sense. This would lower the price of stock that this government would get from the fire sale of Telstra. Senator Alston said in this place:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Optus has indicated an interest that will extend to Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have no doubt that if Tasmanians are interested in the service, Telstra will be looking at it as well.</PARA>
<PARA>`Looking at it' is about as far as it will get, let me assure you. There is no guarantee of access. Both Telstra and Optus have confirmed that they have no intention of rolling out broadband cable in Tasmania. That has been confirmed; they have no intention whatsoever. Telstra will not do it because Optus is not going to do it&mdash;pure and simple.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tasmania cannot be guaranteed access to pay TV. We will end up with Internet access that is simply not up to scratch. Tasmania faces a future with a second&hyphen;rate communications system, a system which will disadvantage consumers and disadvantage the business community. Businesses in Tasmania are trying to compete for a market share through the Internet, and they will be way behind the eight ball. If you want to run a business in Tasmania and have access to those kinds of services, you will have to run the business out of Melbourne in order to get access to state of the art technology. That is ridiculous and absurd.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This will mean a decrease in business investment and a further slowing of what could be kindly described as an already limping economy. Tasmania will become a technological backwater as a result of this initiative, and the people of Tasmania know it. If a partial sale goes through, there is no way that Tasmania will be assured of access to the latest technology. The only way that Tasmania can be guaranteed this access is if <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4516"> the minister has the power to direct Telstra to ensure that that access is there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the loss of ministerial direction is just one of the many safeguards that will go under this bill. The cross&hyphen;subsidisation rates, which currently are provided by Telstra, are absolutely critical for regional Tasmania. Under the existing universal service obligations, the annual access cost per line is highly subsidised in my state. Let me give an indication of the extent of these subsidies. In Burnie, for example, it costs $850 per year to have a phone connected, and Flinders Island is subsidised to the extent of a staggering $4,930 per year. Even Launceston&mdash;which is actually in Bass, one of the few seats held by the Liberal Party in Tasmania&mdash;is subsidised to the extent of $730 per phone line per year. The loss of cross&hyphen;subsidisation will clearly be an absolute disaster.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tasmania is the only state which has every one of its federal electorates receiving a cross&hyphen;subsidy for the provision of telecommunications services. Tasmania is subsidised to the tune of approximately $9 million per year. These universal service obligations are not guaranteed under this bill and, despite what the government says, they will go. The offending clause in the new bill states that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Universal service obligations . . . should be fulfilled as efficiently and economically as possible.</PARA>
<PARA>If private owners of Telstra decide that the universal service obligation is not efficient or economical, they will say they do not want to fund it&mdash;that is what will happen&mdash;and we will have lost the ability to make them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This clause is the carrot for foreign investors. It has quite deliberately been put in there. This is the loophole that will enable the new owners to water down the universal service obligations. This clause changes the universality of our telecommunications system. This government wants a system that links telecommunications access to the ability to pay&mdash;as with everything else this government has done. If you have got the money, you will be all right; you can get the phone on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Once privatised even partially, Telstra will have to comply with the Corporations Law. This law clearly states that majority share holders&mdash;that is, the government&mdash;cannot make decisions that financially disadvantage minority shareholders. That is another loophole for the removal of the universal service obligations. Tasmania is obviously in need of protection, and the status quo is the only way to guarantee that we receive it. A partial sale of Telstra could end up being the straw that breaks the camel's back for Tasmania's economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has admitted that a privatised Telstra, under market forces, may reduce the quality of services. How do we know that? Because why else would they talk about introducing a customer service guarantee if they are not concerned about a diminution in the standard of service? That guarantee would establish minimum levels of services in areas like the time taken for connections and time taken for rectifying faults and service difficulties&mdash;not good enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate committee looking at the bill noted that some submissions, including those of the Telecommunications Ombudsman, argue that a guarantee is not sufficient; it does not go far enough. This guarantee has no accessible enforcement mechanism. Basically, if you cannot afford to pursue the matter, tough luck.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What protection is there for Tasmanians who live in rural areas? What if their phone connection took longer than the time specified under the service guarantee? They would have to go through a process that involves a whole lot of red tape. That will take time and cost money. Effectively, their protection will be lost. That is the reality. The so&hyphen;called guarantee would be worthless.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask Liberal senators representing my home state to think carefully about their social and moral obligations. In doing so, I remind them of the words of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to the Tasmanian state Liberal conference:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will look after and respond to the special needs and interests of Tasmania.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to Tasmanian Liberal senators: why don't you stand up and represent and fight for the people who actually elected you to this place? Why don't you do what the Prime Minister suggests and look after the interests of Tasmania? You have no credibility and you are letting your state down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How do they think they got here? Tasmanians voted for Tasmanian Liberal senators in good faith, and I challenge them to do the right thing by their state. The Tasmanian Liberal senators in this place should hang their heads in shame at what they have done to Tasmania and at what this government has done to Tasmania with their complicity, their compliance, in absolute silence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We did not hear a thing out of them when these budget cuts were being brought down in relation to Tasmania&mdash;not a peep. Senator Abetz flirted with the idea of crossing the floor but was pulled into line by the Liberal Party machine&mdash;which is ironic given his background&mdash;and that is the last we heard. This is their chance to do something positive for Tasmania and vote against the partial sale of Telstra for the state that they represent and for the people who elected them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The partial sale of Telstra is bad news for Tasmania. The partial sale of Telstra is bad news for Australia. The bottom line is that the partial sale of Telstra is bad news&mdash;bad news for the poor, bad news for the sick, bad news for the elderly and bad news for country people.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to talk about some of the national economic benefits of the measure before us. Communications has emerged in recent years as one of the main contributors to economic growth. The growth within the communications industry has been an astounding 18 per cent, or up to five times the growth rate of GDP. Trying to measure the precise economic value of improving an input such as communications services is difficult because it permeates all aspects of our society and because, year by year, it is becoming more important to the way in which we conduct our daily lives.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4518">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> However, with or without detailed numerical analysis, we need to have a clear view of the importance of improvements in communications services. I intend today to move from the macro to the micro level, to demonstrate the real value of truly efficient delivery of services to the broader economy, to the communications industry and to each of us as individuals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Next, I will deal with the broad economic benefits. Australia has been the lucky country in many respects. However, our geographic position in the world and our demographic spread have been major obstacles to accessing markets in commerce and trade. Our relative geographic isolation from major markets has constrained our economic potential. Distance from growth markets, even the north&hyphen;east Asian markets, has limited our ability to trade and to establish a sustained presence in a number of key trade areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem has been compounded by an economies of scale problem whereby Australian firms have made one&hyphen;off deals in particular regions, but are not seen as serious contenders next to large American or European corporations because we cannot finance a sustained presence in these countries. With efficient communications services, our businesses have the opportunity to overcome this barrier of distance to markets and be in a position to compete on an equal basis with other countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Large and small firms will be able to keep in touch with potential buyers electronically without the requirement for expensive representation on the ground. There is a considerable potential for Australian firms to become active in areas where we have considerable expertise, such as the remote sensing, agriculture, fishing, forestry and mining industries. There are also opportunities in service sectors such as telemedicine and education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To become an export focused economy&mdash;and we must really address our balance of payment problems&mdash;we need to get overseas markets and require efficient world&hyphen;class telecommunications links both domestically and overseas. Efficiency in the provision of communications services in Australia will act as a catalyst in opening opportunities for a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> range of Australian businesses overseas. We must take the steps that are necessary to gain this efficiency; otherwise the traditional problems of access to overseas markets will continue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The barrier of distance also applies to large and small firms operating within Australia. Through efficient, affordable communications services, we have perhaps more to gain than any other country in the world by allowing producers and consumers to interact across continents. This is no small point and we should reflect on this for a moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cost and availability of communications services may be the difference between securing a new contract or placing a new order. In short, it could be the difference between viability and bankruptcy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In debating this bill, we need to think about these sorts of issues. The only way we are going to get sustainable jobs and improved standards is through profitable businesses. Profitable businesses need efficient communications services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned earlier the difficulty in measuring the economic value of improving communications services. Despite this there has been some analysis and, as commonsense would dictate, gains at the micro level are quickly translated into massive gains at the macro&hyphen;economic level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra's submission to the recent Senate inquiry provided a detailed exposition of benefits in terms of GDP growth, consumer surplus, more efficient use of the community's resources, improved international competitiveness and reducing the relative cost disadvantages experienced by business and residents in rural and remote regions of Australia. The submission stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">According to Industry Commission analysis, adoption of Hilmer&hyphen;type competition reforms in the telecommunications sector was estimated to achieve significant improvements in GDP of the order of $2.7 billion. Follow&hyphen;up analysis by the Centre for Regional Economic Analysis showed that all industries and every state of Australia would benefit from these reforms. This is because virtually every business in Australia is connected to a telephone network and therefore uses a component of communications as an input in the production process.  <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4519"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also important from an international competitiveness viewpoint that Australia has an efficient and minimum cost telecommunications infrastructure. Improving productivity within Telstra and the industry assists exporters (and potential exporters) to compete in international markets and domestic&hyphen;focused firms to compete with imports. Higher exports and import substitution both operate to increase measured domestic GDP. Furthermore, this could lessen (although difficult to quantify) the current account deficit. Historically a major cyclical constraint to economic growth in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>The inquiry also heard that the Department of Communications and the Arts had commissioned some modelling of the potential economic gains arising from improving Telstra's labour and capital efficiency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This built on work done previously by EPAC and the Industry Commission and suggests that there are some significant potential gains to the wider Australian economy simply through improving Telstra's technical efficiency&mdash;that is, without taking account of likely changes to service offerings. This work was summarised as follows: for labour, efficiency gains of 15 per cent, 30 per cent and 45 per cent were modelled for the communications sector as a whole. These correspond to improving Telstra's ratio of access lines per employee to about 160, 190 and 220 respectively, adjusted for Telstra's market share.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For capital, efficiency gains of zero, 10 per cent and 20 per cent were modelled. Notably, the middle case scenario&mdash;a 30 per cent gain in labour efficiency and a 10 per cent gain in capital efficiency spread over four years&mdash;indicated the following. Private consumption, which is an indicator of living standards, would increase by $1.7 billion or a permanent 0.6 per cent gain. There would be an 11 per cent fall in the long run price of communications services. An associated gain in the economy wide GDP peaking at 0.5 per cent&mdash;that is, $2.4 billion&mdash;by the year 2002&hyphen;3 would moderate to 0.35 per cent&mdash;or $1.7 billion&mdash;in the long run and on a continuing basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A decline in employment in the communications sector of 17.5 per cent would be offset by increases in other sectors in the long run. The economy wide gain would be $3 per <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> employee per week in 1995&hyphen;96 prices. Allowing for the limits of modelling of this type, there are clearly significant benefits to the economy, businesses and consumers from increased efficiency in Telstra and the communications sectors generally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, there are very real benefits for the economy as a whole from improving Telstra's efficiency because of Telstra's importance in the telecommunications sector and the significance of telecommunications to other sectors. The benefits of efficiency gains in Telstra will permeate virtually every area of economic and community activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The telecommunications industry is the star performer in the Australian economy. As I have mentioned, the industry is currently growing at around 18.1 per cent or five times the growth of GDP. But this performance needs to be put in context; otherwise we may be tempted to agree with the opposition's approach of sitting back and not making any preparation for the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telecommunications is a growth industry world wide. This technology plus&mdash;and I emphasise the `plus'&mdash;efficiency gain is driving this rapid growth. In Australia we are receiving some of the benefits of technology improvement, but we are not getting the gain from efficiency. In short, while this result is good, it is not as good as it could be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra, as the major player in the industry, must pull its weight. By being less efficient than it could be, it is effectively constraining the potential of the rest of the sector. Achieving efficiency in Telstra is, therefore, vitally important to the entire telecommunications sector and the growth that has been achieved in recent years will be further assisted by an improved performance by Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn now to the benefits for the home. This debate is not just about the effect on business and cold hard numbers; it is also about the quality of people's lives. Telecommunications services are an integral part of our home life in terms of both conducting our personal daily business and keeping in touch with friends and family.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not confused at all, I was initially to deliver this speech tomorrow night. I will correct myself. All of those in the chamber today would be aware of how they are increasingly making use of communications technology to make the duties of office more manageable and to maintain contact with family and friends. Can you imagine the difficulty you would face in not having a fax machine, an answering machine or even a mobile phone available? Very shortly we will be equally reliant on the Internet access to conduct business and communicate with family members.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Communication services reduce the direct cost and ease the burden that we all face in conducting our daily tasks. Already we do not have to go to a bank to do our banking for an increasing number of items. We do not have to go to a shop to do our shopping. They also provide added benefits that cannot be assessed in monetary terms by improving our ability to cope with days in which time is increasingly at a premium.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telecommunications services clearly provide economic and other benefits to the household. This is evidenced by the fact that we all want access to new communications services at affordable prices and is reflected in the incredible interest there is in the entire debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The conclusion is not only simple and obvious but also vitally important to Australia's future. If Australia is to compete internationally and make full use of the current telecommunications services and the raft of new services to come, we must have access to these services at affordable prices. Government alone cannot provide these services, and protective barriers to operation will not guarantee them in the long term. The only way Australians will get the communications services they need is through an efficient, internationally competitive industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government wants Telstra to continue to be a key player in the Australian telecommunications market in the future. The Telstra bill is about achieving an efficient Telstra to ensure that it has a major role in Australia's <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> telecommunications future. To deny the need for an efficient Telstra, as the opposition parties have done in their rejection of this bill, is either to condemn the company to eventual strangulation by more efficient competitors or to assume that Australia must accept a second-rate telecommunications system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government will not accept the opposition's second&hyphen;best solutions. Australia cannot be held captive by the antiquated ideology of the sanctity of public ownership if we are to join the vast majority of OECD countries that have embarked on privatisation and have realised the full potential of their telecommunications carriers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill represents a driving force in improving Telstra's efficiency and making sure that the company flourishes. It also represents a significant step in ensuring that Australia reaps the full benefits of the communications age.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, the principal reason for the noises we have heard coming from the other side, and for their consistent complaining about this particular legislation, is that we in government, and prior to the last election, were able to get both the heritage trust fund and the reform of Telstra up as a policy position. There is very wide endorsement out in the community in terms of the policy positions that we went to the last election with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, I would like to mention a few things from the point of view of my own state of Western Australia. If what is happening over there continues&mdash;the continued development of our mining industries, the continued development of the initial stages and longer of providing income for this country, export dollars for this country, the continued improvement in our agricultural efficiency and all the other various aspects that go with life over there&mdash;it is absolutely essential that we keep pace with what is happening in the rest of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have acknowledged here before, Telstra has done a fantastic job to this point in time. Now is the time to move into the new age, a different era. It is a different situation; it is not the same as what it was 10 years or 15 years ago. We as a nation cannot <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4521"> continue to support a situation which would be like putting a leg rope round a cow and holding it back, nor can those of us who come from Western Australia&mdash;at least those of us on this side of the chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now is the time to open ourselves up to a different era, a modern era&mdash;an era where Australia wants to go. It is about improving our economic performance as far as our current account situation is concerned, which we have seen happening since we got into government. It is about improving the various stocks around the country as well as the boost of confidence that has occurred. I could mention a whole range of things that I will leave to another time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last 10 to 12 years of my life I have come to rely on a good telecommunications system by having a telephone. There are still a few people who do not have a telephone in Australia, but not many. By having a telephone, I do appreciate the importance of having a good, modern telecommunications service. I look forward to the time when we will no longer have to go out into our paddocks and steer our tractor, but will be able to set the program up in our houses&mdash;which is happening in some parts of Europe now&mdash;and our farming will all be done through telecommunications systems.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The most important reason not to sell off Telstra, from my point of view as a person coming from a rural area, is to protect the universal service obligations. No matter what the government says, the USOs will be in danger  because the coalition wants to remove the minister's power to direct Telstra. This will have an impact in many areas of Telstra's operations, but the main impact will be in the provision of universal service obligations.

That increases the cost to the consumer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part of the USOs at the moment involve cross&hyphen;subsidies to rural areas to reduce the cost to consumers of having a line.

Most small businesses have at least two lines coming into their businesses and one private line at home as a bare minimum. How can you tell me that people in a place like Broken Hill can afford to lose some of the $9,000-plus cross-subsidisation <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4522"> that they receive each year for those three phones? They cannot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The electors of Broken Hill knew it as well, because the swing in Broken Hill did not happen. We maintained our vote. So the electors of Broken Hill were quite able to understand the rhetoric that the government was trying to spread at that stage when they were in opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that the people of Broken Hill would not be prepared, or able, to pay even a part of their $3,000-plus a year for just one phone line. The people of rural Australia will be at a great disadvantage if the universal service obligations were to fall by the wayside. And, rest assured, they will if this government sells Telstra and does not retain the ministerial power to direct the new owners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The process is already under way to reduce USOs. Currently under review is the definition of a `standard telephone service' to be provided under the universal service obligation. The minister believes that the universal service has already been achieved and that those people who do not have a telephone can access it through `a neighbour's phone, a payphone, a phone at work or even a postal service'. For some people in rural and remote areas, it is a bit difficult to find the nearest payphone. It just shows how out of touch this government is with rural conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This would leave only the postal service for people on farms, which is a totally unsatisfactory situation in this day and age. A reduction in the USOs would be highly inequitable and discriminate against people in rural and remote areas. To dramatically increase the cost for them would put them at a great disadvantage and would aid what this government is doing all the time; that is, reducing services to the bush and causing a bleeding of the population from the bush to the city. The government has exacerbated this situation already. This bill will do that even more so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Access to the information superhighway and further advances in communications technology is also a real issue for people in rural areas. It is a concern and a wish list of those people to see these things become part of the standard telephone service. If you live in the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> city, you can log onto modems and the Internet and you pay at the local call rate; but in the bush it is at STD rates. There is a great push in the minds of rural based people to have the same access to communications technology, and they feel that this should be included in the USOs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also very concerned about the impact on jobs, particularly in rural areas, that the sale of Telstra will have. At present, Telstra employs over 200 people in Bathurst and 130 people in Orange. In Bathurst, there are 90 people in the customer service centre. Telstra is a significant employer in many country towns and cities. If the government abolishes those services and jobs in country towns it is going to place a huge drain on the services and cause a huge loss in those communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also the multiplier effect of a loss of wages and people having to move. A lot of these jobs are held by women whose spouses have employment in the community and they are not in a position to find alternative work. They do not have the ability to move to another location to find alternative work. The government has gutted work training programs, so these women will not have access to those. This is the sort of thing that this government will be doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sale of Telstra would most likely see the closure of a number of centres, such as the one in Bathurst, and the consolidation of employment in capital cities. Regional Telstra centres are significant sources of employment for women. Indeed, under Project Mercury, Telstra announced the abolition of 22,000 jobs over the next three years. Where will those job cuts be? The government has said that it will maintain jobs in rural areas. You cannot discriminate against one sector of the work force of Telstra. There is a wide range of skills within the services. They have not outlined with the 22,000 job cuts what skills they are going to cut. It is clear that these jobs are being shed to make this company look more attractive to potential investors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra invests heavily in rural areas. It will spend $34.5 million in the central west of New South Wales in 1996-97 to improve the service to their customers and inject hundreds of thousands of dollars a month into the local <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4523"> economy. The removal of many Telstra employees from this area would be detrimental to the towns in the area and the local economy. The same goes for many other rural towns around Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where is the National Party while this is going on? That is the question that is being asked in the bush. It is letting the Liberal Party roll right over them. The National Party is doing absolutely nothing to stem the tide and to stand up for the needs and aspirations of rural people. They claim to represent the interests of rural Australia, yet this bill will be extremely harsh on the very people they claim to represent. The National Party is yet again falling into step quietly behind the Liberal Party. They are not looking after their electorates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what about the other inequities? It is not only those in country Australia that will be hurt. There is no clause in this bill preventing Telstra, once privatised, from charging for directory assistance. The introduction of charging for this service would be unfair to those who are sight impaired, such as the elderly who have a difficult time reading the small print in phone books. I do not think I am elderly and it is beginning to be like that for me as well. I need to find my glasses to read it.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1X4">Senator WEST</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The only literacy problem over here is you, Senator O'Chee. The government has also broken its promise on separate shares for foreign buyers. Before the election, the coalition promised that it would control the level of foreign ownership by issuing two types of shares&mdash;A class shares for Australians and B class shares for foreigners. The breaking of this promise will mean it is much easier for overseas interests to buy shares beyond the 11 per cent limit. Shares will be able to be held by other interests and it will not show up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Foreign ownership of shares is inevitable. An $8 billion share float, which is the approximate value of one-third of Telstra, could not be absorbed wholly by Australian investors. We just do not have the capital available in this country. We know that from looking at the reaction when Pacific Dunlop tried to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sell off the Edgell&hyphen;Birds Eye subsidiary. What ended up happening? The major investors in this country did not take up the opportunity to invest in this country and it went to Simplot. We have seen it also with the sale of Arnotts. We have seen repeatedly the short&hyphen;sightedness of Australia's investors with regard to actually investing significant amounts in this country. Eight billion dollars is a lot of money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing we keep hearing from the government is that there is so much foreign debt and so much money from overseas in this country. I do not know where the government is going to find $8 billion floating freely in this country to actually pay for $8 billion worth of shares. How many of the institutions and companies who buy shares in Telstra are going to go offshore to borrow money to buy those shares? They will probably then negatively gear so that they will be making a killing on their tax returns. They are the questions that the government does not want to answer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another important issue is that Telstra buys the vast majority of its equipment and materials from Australian owned companies, injecting millions of dollars into our economy. A privatised Telstra would not have to maintain these purchasing patterns. That is very worrying. With some of Telstra inevitably being owned by overseas interests, and overseas telecommunications carriers in particular, these companies may decide that Telstra should purchase equipment from companies in their own countries. We will have no way of overcoming that problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is more, Telstra exports large quantities of telecommunications equipment and services. Asia is potentially an enormous market. Foreign telecommunications carriers that buy into Telstra would certainly not be supportive of Telstra competing with them in such markets and could take steps to prevent that competition.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Apart from all these reasons not to sell our national carriers, it is certainly not the time to be wanting to make the sale. The telecommunications market is to be freed up next year, massively changing the structure and operations of telecommunications in this country. At such a time of uncertainty, trying to sell off the largest carrier adds to more uncertainty and just does not make sense. Massive restructuring of the market and the inevitable restructuring of Telstra that would come through the private ownership would create such uncertainty in both the telecommunications industry and the financial industry that it would have a negative impact on the eventual sale price of the company.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I would like to turn now to some comments made by Senator O'Chee. He quoted some evidence that we heard on the committee to the effect that companies were having difficulties getting skilled and appropriate staff and that they would be quite happy to pick up those who were unemployed or sacked by Telstra. What we did not ascertain, what Senator O'Chee did not say, is where these companies are based. This goes back to my point about Telstra having employees spread well across Australia with significant numbers in rural areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Basically, the companies that I heard give evidence&mdash;and I have seen the transcripts in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>&mdash;have been based in Sydney, Melbourne and some in Brisbane. None of them have been based in rural areas. What are you going to do? You will be sacking the people in the bush; they will have to move to Sydney, Melbourne or Brisbane. What does that do to the problems that this country is already facing? Sydney is one of the larger capital cities of the world and already faces all the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> problems of servicing a city so large: providing accommodation, providing infrastructure for transport and reducing pollution. They just do not seem to take that point into account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I am also concerned that the consumer service guarantee is not an adequate mechanism for consumer protection. We had a number of people come before us in the committee saying that they did not think the proposed customer service guarantee would establish mandatory service levels in a number of areas of service delivery. It was going to be primarily related just to time taken with connecting telecommunications services and  the period for rectifying faults and service difficulties. A number of the submissions argued for amendments to that particular part of the bill. They alleged that the defects in the consumer service guarantee were many and varied; that it needed to be more comprehensive, covering network upgrades, network congestion, transmission and other quality issues. I think this is very important. That is a major reason for one of the recommendations in the majority report. The minister has also chosen to ignore the large number of submissions on that particular issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> We also want to know whether the government intends to sell off only a third of Telstra. We know that on 1 September 1996, the minister told Michelle Grattan on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meet the Press</EMPHASIS> program that the sale of Telstra was `not only inevitable but highly desirable'. the Prime Minister's office went into panic mode. It was the first time they had really been into panic mode; they are getting expert at it, though, after this week. Mr Howard phoned Senator Alston twice to rebuke him for telling the truth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These rebukes are a bit surprising given that Mr Howard, the Prime Minister, had said precisely the same thing in the 1996 winter edition of the Clayton Utz <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Partnership</EMPHASIS> magazine. On page 8 he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Within five years from now the whole of Telstra would be privatised. There are certain things that are unstoppable.</PARA>
<PARA>I happen to agree with him. If you partly privatise Telstra, it is inevitable that the whole lot is going to go. Why be bashful about it and say it is not? It is impossible to reconcile <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4525"> the Prime Minister's comments to Clayton Utz with his criticism of Senator Alston.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to close by reading some extracts of a letter that appears in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Central Western Daily</EMPHASIS>. Andrew McKenzie answers a letter from Senator Macdonald and says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whilst I'm sure the Coalition believes that this is good legislation, my main problem lies with it being able to stand the test of time. I doubt it. Legislation can be easily changed and in five to 10 years I can see politicians under enormous pressure to water down or indeed abolish the legislation. It's all to do with maximising shareholders' wealth and I don't believe that shareholders would tolerate giving us regional areas subsidies for too long.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The tyranny of distance has always made communications vital to the development of our nation. This was recognised a century ago by the framers of our constitution, which to this day gives the Commonwealth the power to make laws with respect to communications. The organisation we know as Telstra can trace its roots back to the Postmaster&hyphen;General's Department formed in 1901 at the time of Federation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So Telstra is not an ordinary company like Optus, for example. Telstra is this country's communications network. Telstra is also the jobs of thousands of Australians who build, operate and maintain that network on our behalf. Right now the Australian people find themselves in the unique position of owning the network&mdash;unique because Telstra is the only one of the top 20 telecommunications corporations by revenue in the world to remain in public ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In proposing this bill, the Howard government is asking the Australian people to sell that network. But they are also being asked to sell much more. I draw your attention to page <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 130 of the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts References Committee's report where it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a period of great opportunities&mdash;to build a fairer, wealthier, better educated and better informed nation. Government must take the lead in implementing a national strategy for the adoption of the new information and communications technologies and services. The ability to take such a lead is far greater while Telstra remains in public ownership.</PARA>
<PARA>If this bill is passed into law, the Australian people will have forsaken the right to make important decisions about the creation of that fairer, wealthier, better educated and better informed nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party believes the key to such a future lies in open and equitable access to the information age. In its final report, the Broadband Services Expert Group warned:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At a time when there are concerns about the concentration of media ownership, open access will also be vital in allowing consumers access to the diversity of views to be expressed and communicated in our society . . . </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is up to us as a community to ensure that information and communication services are used to create the kind of society we want.</PARA>
<PARA>Creative Nation, the previous government's cultural policy statement, emphasised the role of information and communications technologies in making cultural products accessible to all Australians. It argued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In creating and disseminating cultural materials we are weaving a fabric that unites us as a nation, and advancing our economic wellbeing.</PARA>
<PARA>This view, placing the importance of culture above that of the market, contrasts starkly with the government's position as spelled out in its<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Australia Online</EMPHASIS>  policy document. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commerce, not culture will be the driver of new applications and revenue. A successful online services industry will generate the critical mass of infrastructure and revenue required to exploit the new cultural opportunities now emerging.</PARA>
<PARA>This notion that the market alone will drive the telecommunications sector is at the heart of the government's proposal to privatise Telstra. But what has been the experience of relying on market forces alone in other service industries? For example, have changes to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4526"> the banking industry made banks more accessible to more Australians? Or have we seen thousands of jobs lost as branches are closed across Australia, particularly in regional areas, making banks less accessible?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said earlier, Labor believes the key to the future of this country lies in open and equitable access to the new technology. The government would say it shares this commitment, so the real issue here is how this is to be achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Broadband Services Expert Group proposed the concept of `universal reach' as a way of delivering:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . equality of opportunity to communicate at a reasonable cost by matching the needs of the user with the communications capacity provided, rather than giving costly uniform capacity to all users.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, access to the new technology could be matched to people's needs rather determined by their capacity to pay. This approach would see the construction of community information kiosks, a modern equivalent to public parks, a sort of `electronic commons'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This concept of the electronic commons is widely accepted as a possible compromise between the need to provide universal access and the enormous costs involved. Even the coalition recognises the need for the electronic commons but views it `principally as a concept for the delivery of government services'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suspect the foundations of the coalition's electronic commons are already being laid. Consider the government's plan to close more than 600 Social Security and Commonwealth Employment Service offices, replacing them with 300 one-stop&hyphen;shop service delivery agencies. To achieve their objective of delivering government services electronically, all that will then be required is to place these SDAs on line. Job seekers and welfare recipients could then claim their payments by entering their information directly into the department's computers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the government's vision for travel on the information superhighway for those who cannot afford to pay the toll. Already cost is looming as a significant factor in determining who does and does not have <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> access to the new communications technology. Last month the Australian Bureau of Statistics released a survey of household use of information technology. It found that household use of computers increased consistently with income. The highest level of use was found in households with incomes of over $57,000 per year; the lowest level of use was found in households with incomes below $13,000. Of the 4.7 million households who did not use computers, almost a third cited cost as a major barrier. The numbers in each income bracket were also significantly higher for those in capital cities as opposed to the rest of Australia. So special attention needs to be paid to the needs of those in regional areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In its report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Developing Long&hyphen;term Strategies for Science and Technology in Australia</EMPHASIS>, the Australian Science and Technology Council recognised the potential of the new technology to revitalise rural and remote communities across Australia. I have seen this potential realised in my home town of Ipswich. Three and a half years ago, the Ipswich City Council found itself in need of a new library, needing to attract new industries to the region and wanting a new image for the city. The council arrived at a unique solution, deciding to make Ipswich an information&hyphen;rich community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For an initial investment of around $1 million, the Ipswich City Council became a community&hyphen;based Internet provider, establishing the Global Info Link Service at the end of 1994. It was the first council in the country to do so. Already that public investment in infrastructure is paying for itself in not only economic but also social and recreational terms. Public Internet access machines are provided in the city's library, and users are charged a modest $4 per hour. Open to all, I understand the place is usually packed, especially during school holidays. A diverse range of Ipswich businesses&mdash;from manufacturers of fishing lures to clay pavers&mdash;has also taken advantage of the Internet access.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now primary school children in Ipswich can communicate with electronic pen pals around the world, while businesses in Ipswich have become part of the global economy. This <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4527"> is the power of the new information technologies. But perhaps the most significant result has been the growth of computer&hyphen;industry small businesses like equipment retailers and web site designers, of which Ipswich certainly has more than its fair share.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has been achieved by the Ipswich City Council is an example to Australia's other regional centres. Indeed, it is an example which could easily apply to the country as a whole. It is the combination of private and public money which has allowed the Ipswich community to benefit so early from the new technologies. For no matter what the government has been telling the people of regional Australia about the benefits for them in selling Telstra, the fact remains that no business was going to come and invest in infrastructure in Ipswich on its own.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those living in other parts of regional Australia know that the sale of Telstra holds little for them other than a further decline in their local economies and standard of living. Their concerns about job loss came through very clearly in the large number of submissions received by the Senate inquiry, particularly from North Queensland. Those concerned about the effect of this proposal on jobs have already been vindicated. Last month Telstra announced its intention to shed 22,000 jobs over the next three years, at a cost of more than $1 billion in redundancy payments. The minister, Senator Alston, has attempted to comfort the thousands of Australians who are to lose their jobs in Telstra by predicting the ease with which they will find employment in the private sector. What an absurdly hollow forecast.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of annual turnover, the industry's rate of increase in Australia has been estimated at around 10 per cent per annum. However, much of the expansion has been in capital intensive areas. The 1994 Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics study, `Communications Futures', concluded that future employment growth in the industry was more likely to occur in the area of content rather than carriage provision. In any way, the minister's optimism does not take into account the fact that the biggest impact <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of these job losses will be felt in regional centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Even the submission to the Senate inquiry from the Liberal government of South Australia acknowledged:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The clearest employment impact of the Telstra privatisation would be in regional centres where Telstra offices are major local employers.</PARA>
<PARA>In Queensland, this means places like Townsville, where Telstra's key centre employs 700 people; and Maryborough, Mackay, Cairns and Roma, which all have centres providing directory assistance and emergency service numbers. These regional centres are a significant source of employment for women. In fact, in Roma, the Telstra customer service centre is the biggest industry in town.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In February this year, there were more than 12,500 people employed by Telstra in Queensland, one quarter of whom worked in country areas. What price has the government put on the jobs of these people? Which foreign-owned private telephone company does the minister expect will offer these people jobs in regional centres like Roma, Maryborough and dozens of other towns throughout the country?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This proposal was conceived by the coalition in secret and sprung on the Australian people during the last election campaign. Like so many of this government's proposals, we have heard nothing from the government about what we stand to lose from the sale of this public asset. Nevertheless, it is becoming increasingly clear what the sale of Telstra will really mean to the people of Australia. In short, the jobs of thousands of Australians are being sacrificed in order to make Telstra appear more attractive to potential shareholders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opportunity to maximise the social and cultural benefits of the information age will be lost as our communications network is sold into the hands of corporations seeking nothing but profit. I oppose this bill because I believe the price the government has put on Telstra undervalues the network's true worth to this country in terms of regional and cultural development. In effect, it cashes in any chance this country might have to preserve and develop its culture and to create the sort <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4528"> of society that generations of Australians have worked to build.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to participate in the debate on the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill because I strongly oppose the partial sale of Telstra. I am particularly concerned about the social impact that could be felt in my home state of Tasmania. My colleague Senator Mackay has dwelt very eloquently upon that issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tasmania is becoming in many ways an economic basket case under the current state government, and the partial privatisation of Telstra has the potential to knock us around even further. From the outset I concede that to what level Tasmania will be affected by the privatisation of Telstra is difficult to judge and quantify. But, with the changes, affected Tasmania will be and to its detriment upon any privatisation of Telstra regardless of whether a third of it is privatised now or whether ultimately Telstra becomes fully privatised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If on all fronts the benefits of privatisation are reaped in Tasmania, as the government argues, then I will be the first to congratulate the minister who started it all&mdash;the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator Alston. Privatisation has rarely been beneficial for the employees of government business enterprises. A reduction in the employment levels of whatever magnitude will hurt Tasmania&mdash;be it two per cent or 25 per cent. With huge unemployment, the loss of any jobs in Tasmania will hurt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tasmania is still in recession. It is better in the cities of Launceston and Hobart, but outside in the other centres things are not too rosy, I can assure you. Senator West has spoken about those issues in the rural region where she lives. I sincerely hope they improve. But this move to initiate the partial sale of Telstra does not augur well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From Minister Alston we are advised that there were for the last financial year 1,460 Telstra jobs in Tasmania. I have been advised that it could be a little more than that. Although that may not be many in mainland terms, it is heaps in Tasmania. We were advised that only two per cent of those jobs <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will become redundant in 1996-97. That still is a reasonable number of jobs lost for one financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a woeful attempt to lambast Senator O'Brien last week about statements he made in his first speech, Minister Alston did not provide the estimated figures for the more important forward years if privatisation occurred. As a result of Minister Alston's statement on Tasmania, I decided to ring two employees who I knew worked for Telstra in Tasmania. One was a linesman, the other a clerk. Both have worked for Telstra&mdash;or, as it used to be known, Telecom&mdash;for many years. I would describe them both as loyal employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I decided on this occasion not to contact the unions as I had had representation from them and so that I could not be accused of running the union line. Instead, I contacted these two workers whom I knew. They are personally not heavily unionised. Both are married and have children. They are the lifeblood of Telstra and, in many respects, of Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leading up to and since 1992, when Tasmania was included with Victoria as a corporate region, and just after I expect Telstra became subject to the principles of competitive neutrality, both employees admitted that Telstra had undergone a massive shake&hyphen;up. They were both of the view that the level of service had dropped since then, although it was still reasonable. The clerk was frank in stating that administrative overheads during the 1980s and early 1990s warranted cuts, but they were now fairly lean and mean.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The linesman stated that there was some uncertainty as to what the future held with the talk of privatisation on the horizon. He said that only recently in excess of 40 linesmen had been shifted to Melbourne to repair an influx of faults. I do not know if this shifting of a work force for three months away from Tasmania led to a downturn in the level of services for that period&mdash;it probably did not&mdash;but I believe it signifies that the current management sees Tasmania as dispensable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I suggest will happen under privatisation is that, with the effort to produce more rational management and allocation of resources, more Telstra employees will be based <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4529"> in Melbourne. If Tasmania needs a little work and if, in the scheme of things, Telstra can afford to shift employees from Melbourne or Geelong, they will. But these employees will not be Tasmanian. They will come over on the ferry and they will leave on the ferry. They will spend their hard&hyphen;earned dollars back in Melbourne or Geelong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both of the gentlemen I spoke to agreed that the existing involvement of Telstra in Tasmania would change under privatisation. There would be a further shifting of resource and control back to Melbourne, and Tasmania would be serviced and looked upon even more so as a country region of Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was advised that morale in the administrative side of Telstra in Tasmania fluctuated from time to time, but it was agreed that it was not good. With such uncertainty as to the future, I asked what they believed in their experience&mdash;since the shake&hyphen;up of the 1990s&mdash;would be a reasonable estimate of job losses in Telstra in Tasmania if privatisation took place. One had a stab in the dark and said 35 per cent; the other said 30 per cent but that it would be over a reasonable period. That is a little different from the two per cent that Senator Alston indicated will be lost in this financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, after talking to these two typical workers, I am concerned that, with the passing of this bill, jobs will become redundant in Tasmania in the years leading up to the year 2000. At least they will be shifted out of Tasmania to Melbourne. There will simply be fewer consumer dollars to be spent in an economy that is still in recession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I were a Tasmanian Liberal senator, I would be up in arms about this proposed one-third sale. If they cared about the Tasmanian society or the Tasmanian economy, they would be crossing the floor when we vote on this bill. The Tasmanian senators will tell all Tasmanians when they support this bill, `Don't concern yourselves. Sit back, because market forces will ensure that you will not lose out as a consumer.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We see Senator Calvert asking a dorothy dixer of the minister so he can assure us that everything will be all right in Tasmania under a privatised Telstra. Even if after a part&hyphen; <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> privatisation you were fortunate to keep your job, do not expect your wages and conditions to remain at the same level. In many cases these go by the wayside under privatisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now, with what looks like a massive downturn in the number of workers in Telstra operating out of Tasmania, I would expect from all the excitement on the other side of the chamber that there must be some golden benefits that will accrue from this government decision that will be passed on to Tasmanian consumers but, alas, no. I read that there is no simple piece of economic theory in existence or cost-benefit analysis which would provide a definitive answer as to how Tasmania will fare from the partial sale of up to one-third of Telstra. Consumer groups have claimed that the benefits of competition are elusive. I think there is a growing community feeling that with privatisation, Tasmania, with its small population, will not reap the rewards from competition that could possibly accrue on the mainland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question needs to be asked whether Tasmanian taxpayers will get a much better deal with privatisation. Unless you are a Tasmanian taxpayer rich enough to have a shareholding, it is doubtful.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government promises that it is going to look after places like rural Tasmania and, again, Senator West has spoken about that. But we know about the coalition's promises. We would need to ask: could they be broken under changing circumstances once the steps are in train to fully privatise? Evidence abounds that price controls, through regulation and price caps, are not effective when it comes to protecting residential consumers from price rises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am still not satisfied that the government's policy commitment is strong enough. The policy does not refer to social policy considerations in regulating price. That policy commitment is also not satisfactory for maintaining untimed local calls. I envisage that, even if the price cap regime were to remain&mdash;or at least not be tampered with to any great degree&mdash;it would not surprise me that under this government the first change would be to introduce timed local calls. For many, that would be an outrage.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another area is cross-subsidisation. Under cross-subsidisation, Tasmania does continue to receive privileges from Telstra. I think it deserves that assistance. The problem is: how long would that last and how long would Tasmanian farmers on the north-west coast, where I live, be viewed as being deserving of subsidisation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once privatised, the ball starts rolling. I have a real fear that privatising Telstra will begin, in time, to place pressure on the government to water down the universal service obligations. This fear is well founded. Across the Tasman Sea, as I understand it, New Zealand Telecom has been winding the pressure on the government to ditch cross-subsidisation. When the competition starts up&mdash;as much as it can under the current environment&mdash;Telstra will start complaining that, unless the stricture of cross-subsidisation is removed, they will run the risk of getting rolled by their competitors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also note that what constitutes a standard telephone service is not yet settled. The standard telephone service review group is due to report to the minister on 29 November. The extent of universal service obligations is therefore not settled. It is a pretty big ask, I would suggest, for parliament to assume that this review group will recommend a definition that is, in the first place, not ambiguous let alone socially just.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned earlier what the Tasmanian taxpayer could expect to get under privatisation. As we know, we cannot answer that, but we can point to something real and something tangible. It would also be interesting to know what the benefits to Tasmania will be from the recently announced profit of Telstra and the return to government of $2.36 billion. These are the types of issues that Tasmanians are weighing up. These profits <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are the result of, as Allan Brown from Griffith University stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The dual effect of the corporatisation of GBEs, and the introduction of increased competition to the markets in which they operate is mainly responsible for their improved economic performance.</PARA>
<PARA>As my colleague Senator Carr recently said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We see an attempt being made by this government, essentially, to kill the goose that lays the golden egg.</PARA>
<PARA>This is very much the sentiment I get as I speak to the working men and women of Tasmania. They ask: why sell off such a good earner? I wholeheartedly agree with Senator Carr&mdash;why kill the goose that lays the golden egg? Let us think about those people in the community who will be disadvantaged if local calls are timed. Those people are on limited incomes and their only contact with the outside world is their phone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will use an analogy now that would make Arthur Daley livid. It would be the equivalent of Arthur trading a Ferrari for an old model Cortina with column shift and paying the owner, in this case Minister Alston, a further 2,000 readies without even taking it for a test drive to see how it goes. I appeal to my Tasmanian Liberal colleagues to vote against this bill because it will have ramifications for Tasmanians, particularly those disadvantaged Tasmanians.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in the second reading debate on the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill and thank the previous speaker from Tasmania for her most parochial speech. Both sides of the house are used to Tasmanians sticking up for their state&mdash;and rightly so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, on this occasion Senator Denman is much misguided. I put it down to that because I do not think Senator Denman would deliberately get up here and try to push a line she did not believe in. She is not known to do that. Senator Denman, you are greatly misguided in your thoughts on the sale of Telstra. I think you have been fed the line and, unfortunately, you have taken it hook, line and sinker. We have not heard Tasmanian senators from this side of the house expressing the same opinion.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4531">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As speakers on this side of the house have pointed out quite clearly, there is a good reason why the sale of Telstra must go forward for the nation as a whole, including Tasmania. For Tasmania and the rural areas of Australia the proper safeguards are in place. We have pointed those out ad infinitum. This debate went on during the 1996 election and has been going on ever since. It ended up in a time distracting and costly Senate committee that travelled around the country. We are now into the second reading stage and no doubt a long and drawn out committee stage will follow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The arguments are well known; for example, the universal service obligations for the rural districts and states such as Tasmania. We have put them down time and time again, but you are not listening. You are the ones with the ideological bent. If you applied a bit of commonsense to this debate you would see that. You should put the politics aside, if possible, for the sake of the nation. When the Labor government brought its privatisation bills up and tried to sell the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas, we always put the politics aside; we were not obstructionist; we saw the sense in the arguments for the sale of the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas and all the other items it put up when it was in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that the other side of the house has just become obstructionist and political. There is a time and place for that. But, when it comes to matters of high national importance, you would think commonsense would prevail within the parliament. I know there are times to get bogged down in ideological and political debate on legislation, but this is really and truly not one. The opposition lost the last election when this was one of our main policies. We took this to the people. We received our&mdash;to use that overused word&mdash;mandate for the sale of Telstra. So there is absolutely no reason for the Senate to obstruct this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The policy that the coalition did take to the last election we are now dutifully applying. There are three main, crystal clear reasons&mdash;not ideologically based&mdash;why the coalition seeks a one-third sale of Telstra. Firstly, in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the life of the previous government, the parliament supported the complete deregulation of the telecommunications industry as from 1 July 1997&mdash;in fact, the parliament supported that&mdash;which would allow entry into the market by other carriers such as British Telecom and the American Bell Atlantic company. People will be aware of the very fierce competition between Telstra and Optus since Optus entered the market in the 1990s. It will be even fiercer after 1997 with the entry of the likes of, for example, British Telecom and the American Bell company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even though Telstra has announced its latest record profit of some $2.6 billion for the last financial year, for its capital outlay and by world benchmarks Telstra is a grossly inefficient company. So the partial sale of Telstra is designed to inject some commercial discipline into the carrier, to force it to become more efficient and to cut its charges in a very competitive environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that telecommunications is one of the largest overhead costs for Australian companies, competition that will inevitably drive down costs is most welcome for Australian businesses&mdash;as it will be for Australian households.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second reason that the government wishes to sell one&hyphen;third of Telstra is to raise revenue to meet our debt commitments without relying on having to raise taxes, which is the only other alternative&mdash;and this government certainly is not committed to raising taxes. The government debt problem that it inherited from the previous government can be measured by the following figures. In the last four years, in other words, during the term of the Keating prime ministership, government debt jumped from $30 billion&mdash;which was somewhat manageable; we would have loved to have had that amount to manage when we came into government&mdash;to $100 billion. They went on an absolute spending spree and, as a consequence, over $10 billion a year in the budget is dedicated to interest repayments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous privatisations of Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank obviously went up in smoke. The billions of dollars raised by those privatisations were just wasted. We do <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4532"> not know where that money went, except to run up debt. Maybe it went up in smoke when it was used for current expenditure. But this government's strategy is quite the opposite. The sale of one&hyphen;third of Telstra will be used to reduce the debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A debt reduction program will improve Australia's international credit rating, which in itself will bring its own benefits. Take the Victorian coalition government. When that government came in four years earlier, it faced a debt of some $32 billion which it has since reduced to $15 billion. It has achieved an improved credit rating and saved billions of dollars in interest payments. That is the flow&hyphen;on effect of reducing government debt: you improve your credit rating and thus save billions of dollars in interest payments. You also free up taxpayers' money to be used for more worthwhile causes. It is not dead money as we have now with such unwarranted debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of the Commonwealth, a debt reduction program will have the advantage, as I said, of freeing up billions of dollars for other budgetary measures. This leads me to the third reason we want this bill to proceed through the Senate. As the Senate is aware, of the estimated $8 billion raised by the sale of Telstra, $1 billion will be used for the establishment of a Natural Heritage Trust. The aim of the trust is to establish a capital base to fund five projects over five years which will result in the much&hyphen;needed replenishment of Australia's natural environmental capital. As has been stated in this debate before, the five projects are the natural vegetation initiative, the Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin 2001 project, the national reserve system, the national land and water resources audit and the coasts and clean seas initiative. It is a very rare opportunity indeed to have the funds to tackle Australia's worst environmental problems. The alternative&mdash;raising debts or taxes&mdash;is not something this government is committed to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One would have thought the environmental movement would have supported our initiatives by supporting the environmental trust. Certainly the rural sector is eager to have the funds to tackle their most serious problem, the Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin. There is a very urgent need to restore the health of the Darling and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Murray rivers and the lands around those main waterways. The loss of vegetation has contributed to degradation and erosion. In my own state of Victoria, over one&hyphen;third of the irrigation areas have become salinised. It is proposed that some $150 million will go towards the Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin 2001 project to tackle salinity, erosion, degradation and even blue&hyphen;green algae problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the above three reasons for selling Telstra&mdash;firstly, that there is a competitive telecommunications industry with the aim of reducing costs to businesses and households; secondly, to reduce government debt so as to free up taxpayers' funds to be used on budget priorities, and, thirdly, to use some of that money, some $1 billion, towards tackling once and for all our worst environmental problems&mdash;can hardly be recognised as some coalition ideological bent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite frankly, that argument was put to rest by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Kim Beazley, in a speech to the National Press Club in 1994. I will give three prime quotes from his speech so as to lay to rest the ideological debate that has been thrown across this chamber as our main motivation&mdash;that there is no sense behind our cause and that we do not have any genuine social or economic reason for selling one&hyphen;third of Telstra. Let me put it in context. Mr Beazley, when he was in government, agreed with privatisation when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The primary objective driving the privatisation program is to make Australia an efficient, internationally competitive economy&mdash;and that means introducing competition into our enterprises and into our market sectors.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Privatisation fits in with the Government's broader imperative to create jobs&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of course another benefit of privatisation is that it contributes to the Government budget, helping to reduce debt and providing funds for Government programs. The scale of the asset sales process varies from year to year.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>I could not have put it better. If only he had put the proceeds from the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas sales to better use&mdash;to reducing debt. However, I quote the Leader <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4533"> of the Opposition to endorse our case. What a difference opposition makes!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the short time that I have left I will tackle some concerns that have been raised not only in the community but also in this particular debate. The first is the loss of jobs, which is a fair concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Jobs will be lost whether Telstra is privatised or not. Job losses have already been announced. Telstra has to meet world's best practice to put it on a footing with the new entrants that will come in after 1997. But the telecommunications sector, right across the world, is in a boom period and, with the deregulation of the industry, prospects for the future are quite bright.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That boom has seen a growth in jobs in the telecommunications sector, with some 35,000 jobs having been created since 1992. There has been a reduction in the Telstra work force&mdash;I do not have the figure and I do not want to guess at it&mdash;but it is believed that, with the growth in the telecommunications industry, those jobs can be transferred to the new entrants. That was confirmed by a telecommunications union representative, Mr Ian McLean&mdash;a former president of the Queensland ALP and now a branch secretary of the CEPU&mdash;who told the Senate inquiry into Telstra:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not think there will be a difference in the number of jobs, but they will not be working for Telstra; they will be working for Skilled Engineering or some other contractor.</PARA>
<PARA>It is true that Telstra will suffer a loss of jobs, particularly after 1997, but it is hoped and believed&mdash;it is almost assured&mdash;that most of those jobs will be transferred to the new competitors, as happened with Optus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another major concern that has been raised, and which is of great importance to my party, the National Party, is that the rural sector will suffer in particular from the partial privatisation of Telstra. As I said in my introduction&mdash;I do not know how many times we have to say this; I do not think that those opposite will ever believe it&mdash;the fact is that the floor is there; the rural sector will not be disadvantaged. In fact, they will be advantaged by more competition in the telecommunications industry, as the National Farmers <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Federation, which has the interests of the rural sector at heart, has said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the Telecommunications Act 1991, service providers are obligated by law to provide a range of services to all Australians on an equitable basis regardless of where they live or conduct their businesses. With the one&hyphen;third sale of Telstra this obligation will not be diminished; it will be enhanced. The government has already announced that it will require Telstra to move forward its future mode of operation program by three years to the end of 1998 instead of the 2002 deadline. The escalation of this particular program shows the government's commitment to rural areas in regard to telecommunications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rural and regional residents will have access to the integrated services digital network. As I said, the NFF has endorsed the government's decision, which is estimated by Telstra to be of direct benefit to up to 800,000 people who currently have substandard telecommunications. Some 85 per cent of non&hyphen;metropolitan exchanges will be converted to digital by the end of 1997, with the remaining 15 per cent to be upgraded within 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The universal service guarantee will be put into place to ensure standard telephone services and reasonable access to payphones are available to all Australians regardless of where they live or do business. Expansion in technology has certainly made the provisions of the universal service guarantee for country areas easier to adhere to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Solar powered payphones in the remotest areas of the outback have eliminated the need to have expensive telephone lines laid in those areas. The utilisation of the most accessible resource to those people, the sun, has ensured that compliance with the act is very realistic. The National Party and the coalition government have no doubt that, with the partial privatisation of Telstra and the incoming competition after 1997, the universal service obligation will be upheld and enforced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4534"> That answers the two major concerns raised in this debate&mdash;loss of jobs, which is a fair concern, and the universal service obligation, which will be kept in place. If we are guaran teeing the universal service obligation by writing it into law, what is your problem? What is your concern, other than a political one and one of obstruction, Senator Woodley?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is your concern, since we are writing the universal service obligation into the legislation and toughening it up, and bringing all the services up to date before 1998 within rural areas? There is no concern. The reality is that the obstruction that is being shown towards this particular bill is political and out of sync with the public, as was shown at the last election.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Now you are getting me mixed up, Senator Panizza. The Australian Democrats oppose the part&mdash;let alone the full&mdash;sale of Telstra, and we know that is on the agenda. Senator Alston has made that very clear. This is only the first step. Come the next election, if the present government happen to win&mdash;God help Australia if they do; but I would have thought they had a reasonable chance of winning, although I must say that chance is slipping away day by day&mdash;the full sale of Telstra would be very much on the agenda.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the reasons we oppose this sale is that privatising Telstra is not in the long-term interests of Australians, particularly those in remote areas. Having lived for quite some years in inland Australia and having had to use the Royal Flying Doctor Service network to communicate, I know what I am talking about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4536"> Telstra is one of the main providers of telecommunications infrastructure and service. It plays a pivotal role in taking Australia forward into the information age. All Australians deserve to be part of that new information age. The information superhighway does not stop and ought not stop at the edge of Australia's cities or simply hug Australia's coastline. It must reach into Australia's heartland so that all Australians can share in the benefit of new technologies. More import antly, this is necessary to ensure that all Australians can actively participate in modern society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Access to telecommunications services has already become, and is becoming, an essential necessity for being able to actively participate as a citizen. This is particularly true for rural people, for whom the tyranny of distance remains very much a part of daily life. One of the most obvious ways of minimising that tyranny is with high standards of communication. Yet many services, taken for granted by you and me who live in metropolitan centres or close to them, are not available to people at many rural exchanges. This confirms the need for the urgent upgrading of the universal service obligations and ensuring regular reviews are guaranteed in legislation, as was recommended by the Senate Telstra inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me tell you what the government did. It does not even understand the need to upgrade those universal service obligations. All it could do was pick up exactly the same words out of the current bill and, without alteration, transfer them into the bill which it is proposing. It has no idea about the need of upgrading the universal service obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How far and how fast the information age reaches rural and remote Australia depends to a significant extent on whether Telstra's board is directed by government policy or whether commercial considerations form a part of Telstra's decision making. Public ownership will make it far easier to ensure all Australians&mdash;</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HX5">Senator WOODLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do try to respond to interjections, but maybe I should continue. By retaining Telstra in public ownership, it is far easier to ensure all Australians are provided access to adequate telecommunications services at an affordable price, because the minister has the power to direct Telstra in the public interest. However, it is essential to note that, in the Telstra bill, the government is proposing to remove the power of the minister to direct Telstra in the public interest&mdash;a very serious move indeed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This makes it clear that the government's intention is to ensure Telstra is placed on a fully commercial grounding, with profit maximisation as its aim. If the government has its way, the public interest will no longer guide the operations of our national communications carrier, unless of course the company's best interests happen to coincide with those of the nation. This will not occur in so far as rural and remote Australia are concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is perfectly evident if one looks at the massive broadband cable roll out that both Telstra and Optus are massively investing in, yet their sole focus is the major capital cities. Rural and remote Australia have been left by the wayside, while major metropolitan centres are unnecessarily being provided with a duplicate infrastructure. The fact is that national resources, wasted by duplication, could be much more effectively used for the installation of state-of-the-art technology to rural and remote consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leaving outcomes to the market sometimes does not work, especially for rural people. This is something the present government, which is ideologically blinded by the market theory, ought to realise. The government sometimes simply must intervene to ensure the national interest is taken care of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Let us look at the universal service obligations and price controls. There are attempts to safeguard rural and remote communities <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4537"> through the imposition of the universal service obligation and by imposing price caps. The USO is the obligation to supply and ensure that the standard telephone service is reasonably accessible to all people in Australia on an equitable basis, wherever they reside or carry on business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is imperative, however, not only that telecommunications services be made available to rural and remote communities but also be that they are affordable. It is imperative that all Australians benefit from lower telephone prices and charges resulting from improvements in technology and efficiency&mdash;not just business customers and those in urban areas. Price controls are essential for ensuring rural and remote customers are beneficiaries and not solely customers in large capital cities, especially corporate customers. The government has sought to allay community fears by promising to retain the USO and price caps. To emphasise this, the government has rewritten the existing universal service obligation into the present bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Let me talk about lobbying. A large, powerful, privatised Telstra, whose sole intention is maximising profits for its shareholders, will lobby hard to have any regulatory impediments to this aim removed. Private shareholders will be entitled to expect management and its board to seek to maximise profits and to lobby the government to remove any regulatory impediments to this aim. The fact is that a privatised Telstra would be governed by a board of directors acting not in the national interest, nor in the interest of rural and remote communities, but in the interest of the company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This company would be Australia's second largest. It will lobby hard to free itself of stringent price caps and to be free of the universal service obligations. This is what has happened with British Telecom. To give the Senate an example of this, a letter of 11 September from British Telecom to its shareholders was recently brought to my attention. The letter thanked shareholders for actively lobbying the UK government to reduce the proportion of British Telecom revenues directly subject to price caps. They were eventually successful in getting this down <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> from just under two-thirds to around one&hyphen;quarter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moreover, they were able to get Oftel to agree to a retail price cap of inflation minus 4.5 per cent. The retail price cap was, however, RPI 7.5 per cent; so British Telecom were able through corporate and shareholder lobbying to achieve a far less stringent price cap to the detriment of those customers who are not the beneficiaries of competition. Moreover, the letter actually states that British Telecom `welcome the regulator's statement that this will be the last retail price cap'. The letter concludes by praising shareholders for lobbying on behalf of the company. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am delighted that so many shareholders chose to participate in the regulatory debate. Your support has helped us in our discussions with both Oftel and the Government. Your Board would appreciate your continued support in encouraging the Government to introduce as soon as possible the legislation we all agree to be the best way forward.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the way that corporate lobbying works in the UK. There is no reason to expect it would be any different here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What assurance have we that the Australian government will prove itself more resilient to corporate lobbying? It is legitimate for the Australian people to expect the government to pursue social objectives in the provision of  telecommunications services; that is, to focus on the public interest. The government, however, is seeking to remove the power of the minister to direct Telstra in the public interest, despite the fact that the government is saying it will maintain two-thirds ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we really need is not simply maintenance of the current universal service obligations but an upgrading of them. They are out of date and they need to be upgraded if we are not going to condemn rural and remote communities to antiquated telecommunications facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The recent Senate Telstra inquiry recommended that the definition of the `standard telephone service' be upgraded to providing for more than simply voice telephony. They advocated including high speed fax and data transmission and Internet services as well. As my colleague Senator Lyn Allison has already <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4538"> foreshadowed, the Australian Democrats will be looking at ways of upgrading the universal service obligation. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

It has caused concern to people in business, the rural people in my state of Queensland, Telstra workers, the aged, potential overseas buyers and, of course, the union movement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Firstly, I would like to make some reference to the speeches in the second reading debate by the Hon. Warwick Smith, the member for Bass, and by Senator Newman, delivered on 2 May and 9 May respectively. It is fairly coincidental that their speeches were almost identical. In their second reading speeches, they said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Partial privatisation will both benefit Telstra as a company&mdash;by making it even more responsive to market signals and better able to compete domestically and internationally&mdash;and benefit the Australian public through increased investment opportunities, a more efficient communications sector and reduction in public debt via the sale proceeds.</PARA>
<PARA>They further stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the most critical justifications for the injection of private equity into our major telecommunications carrier is the need to achieve a more efficient Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA>Both of those quotes are of themselves great quotes when talking about the partial privatisation of Telstra. However, I believe <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that we are now looking in the longer term at the full sale of Telstra. As far as increased investment opportunities are concerned, that is simply in the eye of the beholder. One has to have the money to be able to invest in these things first for them to be an attractive proposition. Most of the people that I have had the pleasure of representing over the last 20 years are certainly not going to be in the position to be able to dig deeply into their pockets to share in the benefit of a partial privatisation or a full privatisation of Telstra. That is a nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Former CEO of Telecom, Mel Ward, has put forward four points in favour of privatisation. He states, firstly, that private sector discipline is needed to meet competition; however, government control leads to interference with management responsibilities. He believes that control and management need to be separate. Secondly, governments cannot separate ownership and policy regulatory objectives with the result that policy goals get mixed up in management objectives. Thirdly, Telstra is not free to raise capital where it likes, while it remains subject to Loan Council controls. Fourthly, government places heavy dividend demands on Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are hardly points in favour of the partial privatisation of Telstra. One would think that these go to the government's longer term objective&mdash;that is, the full privatisation of Telstra. Whilst the government adamantly says that it has no intention of fully privatising Telstra, there is nothing stopping them, subsequent to this legislation, coming back for another bite of the cherry to satisfy the need to raise more capital by selling off further sections of the Telstra organisation. I think that Senator Alston's remarks, which he has subsequently retracted, about the full privatisation of Telstra clearly show that, whilst that might not be on the government's current agenda, it nonetheless remains part of its long-term agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to turn briefly to rural Queensland. Telstra injects $473 million into the Queensland economy each year by way of salaries, goods and services. Telstra in Queensland employs 12,875 people, many of whom are in rural Queensland. As Telstra is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4539"> 100 per cent Australian owned, it puts all its profits back into the communities which it serves. None of the profits are currently going overseas. If we see a partial privatisation of Telstra, then inevitably the profits which are generated by Telstra will go offshore and will not serve the community as they have done for so long in this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Capital expenditure in Queensland in the 1995-96 year was $508.5 million. There has been a heavy involvement in rural Queensland. When one looks at the golden triangle&mdash;that is, the Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra area&mdash;with a partially privatised Telstra, I wonder how much attention will be given to places such as rural Queensland when one looks at the bottom line that even a partially privatised Telstra would be looking at, and that is profit. If the profit is not there then the non-profitable areas will be sacrificed to some extent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some 20 years ago it cost nearly $250,000 to put on 12 customers in the Marlborough region in northern Queensland. The customers actually had to pay a maximum of only $2,000 to be connected to the Telstra system. How much would they pay under a privatised or partly privatised Telstra?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to look at the figures for cross&hyphen;subsidisation in some of the regions in Queensland. If you look at a seat such as Hinkler, which encompasses the area around Bundaberg, there is $3.724 million in cross&hyphen;subsidisation annually. In the more regional areas, such as Maranoa, which extends from the Northern Territory&hyphen;Queensland border in the west right through to and including places such as Warwick, Goondiwindi, Stanthorpe and St George, you find that there is massive cross&hyphen;subsidisation of $16.485 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Without going through all of these figures, the cross&hyphen;subsidisation figures in Queensland alone are of the order of $50.982 million. Whilst I have referred mainly and predominantly to only a few of the more major figures in that area it really leaves me quite concerned about what will happen to rural and regional Queensland under a privatised Telstra&mdash;whether it be one-third privatised in the first instance or wholly privatised in the longer term.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I am also concerned about the loss of rural jobs in Queensland. Let us look at the number of service jobs that are at risk under a privatised Telstra. In Toowoomba, you are looking at about 133 jobs; Roma, about 64 jobs; Maryborough, 75 jobs; and Nambour, 120 jobs. Whilst these are not large numbers in terms of the totality of the population, the impact of those job losses on some regional and rural places throughout Queensland is quite significant indeed. They impact on the local economy and the ability of the local infrastructure to service itself in the longer term. The drive for the part&hyphen;privatisation of Telstra, whilst it leads to a loss of jobs, is of major concern for me given the diversity of Queensland and the number of rural and regional centres which depend on government infrastructure for their survival.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> It was interesting to note that Frank Blount, the CEO of Telstra, has stated that it would be cheaper in some cases to export the jobs, particularly Operator Assistant Service Centres, to places like the Philippines. All I can say is that when one moves around and talks to people in rural and regional areas that leaves no impression upon them whatsoever. The loss of jobs is very important&mdash;somewhat a key issue in this whole thing, as far as I am concerned&mdash;because, otherwise, this becomes purely an economic rationalist exercise, a sociological exercise in putting forward some budgetary constraints.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In response to something that Senator McGauran raised before, I would like to elaborate on the figures that I believe will be lost under the privatisation or part&hyphen;privatisation of Telstra. In Queensland, we have already seen 4,000 jobs go in the Telstra organisation, predominantly through natural attrition. Under a privatised or partly privatised Telstra, a substantial number of jobs will go in the future. If we look Australia wide, that figure is some 24,000 jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth while quoting the Telstra report in regard to the issue of job losses. This is a key theme at a time when unemployment in this nation is not improving&mdash;it is getting worse&mdash;and people are interested in their security of employment. At page 91 of the report, paragraph 5.18 states:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4540">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Project Mercury was an internal program initiated by Telstra management, in April 1996, to prepare Telstra for privatisation . . . The aim was to shed 24,000 Telstra staff by July 1998, predominantly through outsourcing functions currently performed in-house and/or through selling off parts of Telstra's business considered to be `non-core'.</PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 5.19, inter alia, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Redundancies caused by this process were to be `management initiated', not voluntary.</PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 5.21 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such a process would fundamentally change the character of Telstra. Many functions currently performed efficiently by Telstra staff, such as fleet management, would be outsourced. Certain specialist areas (such as Electronic Products and Services and the Information Technology Group) would be handed over to others, with all the consequent risks of skill loss and increased dependency on external suppliers. These considerations appear to be secondary, however, to the push to reduce Telstra's direct staff levels (its `head count') in anticipation of privatisation.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the real killer in this legislation&mdash;the loss of jobs, the loss of people's dignity, the loss of people's income. It was quite clearly anticipated through Project Mercury, which was established prior to the full sale of Telstra being put to this parliament and being the subject of debate here today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> What we are talking about is jobs for Australian people. Talking about jobs being outsourced&mdash;there are about 15,000 jobs being outsourced, as I understand it&mdash;does not guarantee that those jobs will automatically translate and transfer into the private sector in the same way as they existed within the Telstra environment. This is in an environment where there are many areas of Telstra already understaffed. This affects the service that people are receiving and limits the ability of people to get the service that they need out of an efficient and effective Telstra organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1">  I also have concerns for the aged who currently might have access to concessions. Whilst it may be the intention to enshrine those concessions&mdash;that may be done with the best good will and intention&mdash;I always have the fear that, further down the track, when people find the bottom line is not being met, profit is not being met, many of these under takings will get pushed to one side in the mad drive to maintain profit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to refer briefly to some overseas comparisons when considering this legislation. It is interesting to look at the New Zealand experience: since they have gone into privatisation costs have risen in the order of 30 per cent in real terms since the mid&hyphen;1980s. So there is no guarantee that privatisation will lead to cheaper or better services. Business rentals and charges have decreased in that time while residential charges have increased.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Britain, for example, the cost of first line access has risen with privatisation by 61 per cent. In January 1992 an independent consulting group established that the UK had one of the highest residential call charges, well ahead of France, Germany, Japan, Sweden and the Netherlands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My question is whether, with the privatisation of Telstra, we are going to go down the same path of looking after big business and forgetting the residential, the small business person, the consumer and, in particular, those people who live in the far and scattered places throughout this nation&mdash;out of the hub centres such as Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that this legislation will lead to job losses. I believe it makes a mockery of the government's promise to increase employment. If you look at 1985, you will find that the now Prime Minister (Mr Howard) advocated Telstra's privatisation much like Mrs Thatcher did with British Telecom.</PARA>
<PARA>There is nothing to assure anyone in this nation that in the long term we will not head down the path of a fully privatised Telstra. Even if the partial sale does go ahead, there is no guarantee it will benefit this nation. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There have been some splendid speeches in this debate, as you have no doubt heard, Mr Deputy President. Indeed, people now in this very chamber have made some quite outstanding speeches. I thought I ought to pay regard to them. I read the speech of the shadow minister, Senator Schacht, where he made out an excellent case for the defeat of this bill and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4541"> for Telstra being kept in its present state. So I gathered the argument that is put against the bill through reading Senator Schacht's speech.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thought I ought to then read the second reading speech in support of this bill. As I go through it, it seems to me that it is a very equivocal speech indeed; that it may well make out a case for the preservation of Telstra in public hands. In the summary at the back on page 18 of the speech, there are a few things I want to quote and comment on. The summary starts:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill is a clear indicator of the Government's intent to do all in its power to deliver on its election promises.</PARA>
<PARA>That is absolutely so. It is a correct statement, as there is no doubt that it was an election promise to sell off a third of Telstra. The second paragraph goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition can hardly claim that there is some national interest to be protected by retaining the company in full ownership&mdash;the former Prime Minister made clear in June 1994 on national television that there is no essential significance in the ownership of Telstra so long as it was subject to the competitive disciplines of the market.</PARA>
<PARA>In addition to that there have been points made in debate&mdash;I think Senator O'Chee in one of his excellent speeches made the point&mdash;that the Labor Party when in government sold off many of the assets that the Commonwealth owned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not sure that that is an argument. Either it is right to sell Telstra or it is wrong. That has to be judged in terms of the particular object that has been sold off. I think that both you and I, Mr Deputy President, were members of the government party that sold off the Commonwealth Bank. On reflection, I am not sure that that was the best thing we ever did in government. I am sure that the selling off of Telstra would certainly not be the best thing that this parliament will have done if it does sell it off by the end of this term. So I am not sure that quoting what other governments have done is an argument for taking a step now which might be all too drastic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third paragraph of the minister's speech on the second reading goes on to talk about the three vital functions that this bill is to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> perform for all Australians. It talks about the environment and then sets out some issues that need to be tackled. They are, indeed, very important issues. They deal with the rehabilitation of the Murray-Darling; money to be spent on a national land and water resources audit; $100 million for a coast and clean seas initiative. All of these projects are most essential. But all of these are so important that the issue of whether or not this bill goes through should not determine the spending on those particular items. In other words, those items are so important&mdash;and this is a point that is made again and again&mdash;the money should be spent whether a third of Telstra is sold or not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The importance of those projects is made out by the minister himself in the second reading speech. The conclusion that the minister, the government and this chamber ought to reach from his comments is that those things should be done&mdash;and they should be done straight away, without waiting for the sale of a third of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second reading speech of the minister continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the most critical justifications for the injection of private equity into our major telecommunications carrier is the need to achieve a more efficient industry and a more efficient Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA>I cannot quite follow that, and perhaps senators following me in this debate will explain that to me. I am unable to see that a sale of one-third of Telstra will achieve a more efficient industry and a more efficient Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sale of Telstra as a whole might achieve that, on the theories that are going around&mdash;and one of those theories is that, if a thing is in private hands, it will be more efficient and better. I do not happen to believe that, but that is the argument put, and it has been put here. But from that we then reach the conclusion that the sale of a third of Telstra will achieve that&mdash;but the sale of a third of Telstra will not be the privatisation of Telstra. The promise or the trouble is&mdash;and, indeed, Senator Alston got himself into trouble for suggesting to the contrary&mdash;that only a third of Telstra is being sold. So how can this argument work&mdash;that is, that if there is an injection of private equity into this <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4542"> telecommunication there will be a more efficient industry and a more efficient Telstra. It just does not follow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next issue I want to talk about is this: the second reading speech then continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The onus is on those who have so far been content to hide behind outdated ideological defences of the public sector, to demonstrate that business as usual is going to be anything other than a recipe for declining competitiveness for our major carrier and inferior consumer outcomes for all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA>That is one of the problems about this debate&mdash;that the onus is put on those on whom it should not be put. The onus is upon those who are to sell this. The people who allege that something ought to be done, who say that a particular step ought to be taken, ought to be the ones to show that that is so. I see in the gallery here a very eminent lawyer from Victoria, Mr David McKenna, who practises extensively in the criminal area. He will tell you how this idea of onus ought to work.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But in the event, the point is this: the whole debate in this area has gone forward on the basis that the onus is on those who want to maintain the status quo&mdash;and the status quo, as I will come to later on in this speech, is pretty good; the minister admits that the status quo is pretty good. But it has been said that the onus should be on those who want to preserve the present situation&mdash;and the present situation is that a very big dividend is being returned to the Commonwealth; that this is the highest taxed company in Australia which contributes more to the public coffers than any other company in Australia, and that is in the second reading speech.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The onus ought to be on the government to show that a company which is producing so much for Australia should be sold. To come <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in here and state in the second reading speech that the onus is upon those who want to resist this, and that is the end of the argument, is just nonsense. It is not in accordance with the great philosophies and great traditions with which Senator MacGibbon, Senator O'Chee and Senator Parer have grown up in that great Liberal tradition.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this adjournment debate to address a number of issues that seem to have been the subject of some attention in the other place yesterday during question time, particularly with respect to the involvement of many of the Labor members and senators with their trade unions. Being a senator who has a very long history in the trade union movement arising initially out of the three years I spent on sites working as a labour, it is quite interesting that this very fact now is being used by this government to try to throw back in Labor's face the issue of conflict of interest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, it is quite astounding that the government has been so desperate to use this issue as the one they bring forward in a petty attempt at defence of the issue of shares they are confronting in both houses of parliament. I think this attempt to deflect the attention from them and to bring in the issue of union <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4543"> membership and former union representation of many of the Labor senators shows just how removed this government is from working people in this country. You need only look at the role of unions in Australia and the work and commitment that has been shown throughout all of those organisations in the advancement of the interests and the rights and conditions of employment of working people to understand and appreciate the value of the union movement.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What about the rally at Parliament House?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7G6">Senator LUNDY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is interesting to see that senators from across the floor, on the government side, continually dig up the rally that occurred here on 19 August as an issue to deflect focus from the problem at hand. The problem at hand is that we have a government with frontbenchers who have been exposed as having a conflict of interest as a result of their shareholdings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This issue highlights the great distinctions that exist between Labor representatives and Liberal government representatives. The distinction is that we on the Labor side do represent working people. The fact that many of us have a trade union background reinforces the fact that we have been working in our various roles&mdash;as on&hyphen;site shop stewards, as delegates or as health and safety representatives, which is where I started off&mdash;and have come into this place to further those interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very telling that this distinction comes into play when we are dealing with the bunch of very wealthy people on the government front bench. This distinction and the highlighting of this distinction as a result of this debate I think really define the role of the two major parties into the future. There are not only major differences with respect to policy but there are major differences with respect to where we are coming from.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know where I am coming from and what I bring to this place. It is unique in a number of ways in terms of my background as a labourer here in Canberra. The strength of this place is that it brings together people with a wide variety of experiences. I, for one, would like to put in my view about the importance of people with a union background&mdash;people <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> with a background in representing the real interests of working people in this country&mdash;being in this place, speaking their mind and pursuing the aspirations of working people generally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Union members right around the country and all those workers who are not members of a union but who have benefited from the gains of the trade union movement over a long period of time recognise the role that the unions have played. It is an association that I am extremely proud to be part of. The value and importance of transferring that experience and that commitment to improving the lot of working people to this place is something that no-one can deny has intrinsic value in the political process in this country. For this government to use it as a political stick exposes it as being the most shallow, contemptuous frontbench you could possibly imagine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The union movement has a very proud tradition in this country. The union movement has improved this country's workplace conditions and the whole philosophy of having a fair go in the workplace. It has ensured that there is some level of commitment to a degree of occupational health and safety, which means you can go into a workplace and come out of it in the same condition. That is something that is not often replicated in many comparable Western democracies. It is something that sets us apart. It is part of the whole debate about workplace relations, which we are looking at at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that what we are seeing on the agenda with the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill is something that will disassociate Australian workers and their ability to fight for their rights and to maintain their working conditions and their conditions of employment. The workplace relations bill epitomises the very paranoia and the very platform that this government came into office on. I recall very clearly the first headline that came out early on in Howard's ascendancy to the leadership </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4544">
<PARA>of the Liberal Party. It was about how he was going to trash the unions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When he says he is going to trash the unions, he is saying that he is going to trash the workers. He is going to go after their wages and conditions. That is what he is saying. When he talks about individual choice, he is talking about isolation. That isolation of workers and their inability to defend themselves ultimately lead to exploitation and the downgrading of their conditions of employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So when I see this government come in with an agenda like that contained in the workplace relations bill and I see headlines that really in the first instance declare where Howard is coming from, it is a very telling moment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very telling to know that Mr Howard has an agenda of industrial relations. His agenda is to break the unions and to reduce the conditions of workers. He thinks that misguided philosophy and ideology will somehow be the solution to this country's problems. I refute that completely. I do not believe that that conservative ideology has any place in this country. That is the challenge before Labor from hereon in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The more Mr Howard and his ministers focus on his anti-union beliefs and rant and rave&mdash;such as Mr Reith, who ranted and raved in the other place yesterday during question time&mdash;the more they expose themselves as being a one-eyed government with no vision, with no broad agenda and with no regard to the social values that have evolved in this country over the last century and that are intrinsically based in our industrial relations system. That includes the involvement of the union movement and the involvement, therefore, of workers in that process and the ability of those workers to maintain some say in what their lives are like and the standards and conditions under which they work.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>
