<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We the undersigned citizens respectfully submit that any reform to Australia's system of industrial relations should recognise the special needs of employees to be protected from disadvantage, exploitation and discrimination in the workplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We the petitioners oppose the Coalition policies which represent a fundamentally anti&hyphen;worker regime and we call upon the Senate to provide an effective check and balance to the Coalition's legislative program by rejecting such a program and ensuring that:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">9.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> A `fair go all round' for unfair dismissal so that all workers currently able to access these remedies are able to do so in a fair manner, at no cost.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the proposal to use the Holsworthy military range as a possible site for the construction of Sydney's 24 hour second international airport.</PARA>

<TITLE>Veterans Entitlement Legislation</TITLE>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Petition of the undersigned shows that only one group have been excluded from eligibility for repatriation benefits in the Veterans Entitlements Act 1986 (the Act) where such group has performed honourable overseas `active service'. That group being, members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 which were excluded under `Operational Service' at Section 6.(1)(e)(ii) of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The various claims made in Statements to the House and the Senate and the contents of correspondence from various Ministers to maintain the exclusion are answered as follows, the answers are from documents obtained under FIO and from public record:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i) `They were never allotted for operational service', (contained in a letter from The Hon. Con Sciacca Minister for Defence Science and Personnel 1995). A letter from the Secretary Department of the Navy to Treasury dated 11 November 1955 stated, `the date that the Navy were allotted for operational service was `1 July 1955'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii) `Members of the RAN were only doing the duty for which they had enlisted', (October 1956 The Hon. Dr Cameron representing the Minister for Repatriation in the Senate). This applies to all Service personnel everywhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iii) `They were in no danger', (November 1956 The Hon. Dr Cameron representing the Minister for Repatriation in the Senate). They shared the same danger as all other Australian Service personnel serving in Malaya at the time. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7117"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iv) `They were not on Special Overseas Service', (in a letter from the office of The Hon. Bronwyn Bishop Minister for Defence Industry Science and Personnel to Mrs Williams of Adelaide dated October 1996). Requirement for Special Overseas Service was introduced in 1962 without retrospective conditions, therefore has no relevance to events of 1960.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(v) `They were not on Active Service', (in a letter from the office of The Hon. Bronwyn Bishop Minister for Defence Industry Science and Personnel dated October 1996). It is now, as it was then, that Service Personnel had to comply with one of three requirements for Active Service, this group complied with two, or twice as many as is needed. The one that they did not comply with was, `is in military occupation of a foreign country'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your petitioners therefore request that the Senate should remove the discriminatory exclusion in the Act, thereby giving the Australian sailors involved comparative recognition with the Army and RAAF personnel that served at the same time, and all other Australians who have served their country on active service overseas.</PARA>

<STATE> (South Australia)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(9.57 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is my amendment to restore the power of the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) to direct the board. We had a lengthy discussion for over an hour yesterday in the chamber in this committee stage. The minister made a number of comments that this was unnecessary, that this had never been used since 1991 and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7121"> therefore it was no longer needed to be maintained in the bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition rejects the minister's view about this. First of all, I do not think it is any defence at all to say that since 1991&hyphen;92 this power has never been used, therefore it can be eliminated. Between 1991 and the present time Telstra has been under the full ownership of the Australian government and has operated as a government business enterprise within those arrangements. It has operated as a commercial entity. That is certainly true. But, as the sole shareholder on behalf of the Australian people, the then government back in 1991 believed that it was only reasonable that that power to direct be there, even though neither the present minister nor previous ministers have sought to invoke that power. Of course, if they did invoke that power the direction will have to be tabled, be publicly available and available for public debate. That is a transparency that nobody could disagree with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister says that in a commercial operation this would be an inhibition to the operation of Telstra. If you were probably selling the whole of Telstra, minister, you may have a different argument. The Australian people, through their elected government, own 66&frac23; per cent as the shareholders of Telstra. It is your policy to maintain it at that level until a subsequent election where you would put that issue if you wanted to go to full privatisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that scenario, I think most Australian people would say,`The government on our behalf should be able to have a direct say in the national interest in what is good for the Australian people.' You are not dealing here with a normal company; you are dealing with a company which Senator Harradine describes&mdash;quite rightly&mdash;as a natural monopoly, and it will be a natural monopoly for the foreseeable future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even if it does drop 10 or 15 per cent of its market share, that share still will be 70 per cent plus for the foreseeable future. Under any definition that is a natural monopoly. In the Australian marketplace if you were merging two companies that were going to have anything over 50 per cent of that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> marketplace the ACCC would say, `No, you are not going to merge and create a company that has that much control in the marketplace, that much dominance.' Telstra has nothing like just over 50 per cent: for the foreseeable future it will be over 80 per cent. It is the natural, dominating, monopoly&mdash;even if it is partly privatised. Therefore, it has obligations in providing to its Australian consumers. But above all else, an obligation to provide the basic telecommunications system to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although we have not seen the details of its new business plan, the announcement that it will expend, over the next three years, some $12 billion on infrastructure in Australia is an issue of considerable national importance. I think most Australian people would say it is not unreasonable for the minister to have a direct influence if we believe that expenditure is not in the national interest. It would be extraordinary to say, `This board will make decisions from time to time and if the minister wants to do it the only way will be for him to say, "Ah well, then we will subsequently amend the Telstra Act or the Telecommunications Act in a catch&hyphen;up mode."'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is really shutting the door after the horse has bolted in many cases; the minister knows that. He deals with the Telstra board, the Telstra chief executive, regularly through informal discussion. I accept that is the proper way that it should happen at the moment. You will still be representing the two thirds shareholder. In normal corporations a shareholder with a two thirds ownership would expect to have some reasonably effective say in how that company was managing itself and what it was doing. Yet the minister says to us that despite Telstra being the most important company in Australia, the biggest company in Australia, in which the people will be the two thirds shareholder, we should walk away from having any say at all; allow the minority under company law when it chooses to under the AIDC example&mdash;that Senator Cook so adequately explained yesterday&mdash;to dominate the majority; dominate the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister would then have to come back in here and move some specific amendments of a retrospective nature to try to overcome the problem. That is not a sensible way to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7122"> manage and run the national telecommunications system in Australia which is this natural monopoly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the answers the minister gave yesterday in response to some of the queries raised in this debate on this amendment are still not getting to the nub of accepting that Telstra one&hyphen;third privatised is a natural monopoly two&hyphen;thirds owned by the Australian people and has a national interest. The minister has just said, `What is the national interest? It can never be described.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course the national interest will be raised from time to time as people in the community say, `We want Telstra to do this; we want the telecommunications system to be something else or amended accordingly.' The national interest debate will take place from time to time and people will argue the merits of the national debate. Minister, you would be part of that debate. You might well argue that issues raised by some people are not really in the national interest and, therefore, you as a minister would not exercise your powers. That is fine, but at least there would be a debate in this place and in the community at large about what you would do or not do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a transparency that ought to be available to the Australian people so we get some idea of what is going on, and where Telstra is going, because the decisions it makes in management will have profound effect on the lives of ordinary Australians if we want to make sure in the next century when the access to telecommunications and to data information is going to be a major issue of whether people are information poor or information rich. Telstra, providing 80 per cent of that to Australians, will be at the forefront. If it makes from time to time so&hyphen;called commercial decisions that affect and worsen the situation vis&hyphen;a&hyphen;vis the information rich/information poor issue that is a national interest that ought to be debated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The minister ought to be willing to direct Telstra if he believes they are not acting in the national interest. The minister has not convinced the opposition in any way that having this power is in any way going to affect the good running of Telstra for all the Australian people and in particular remember ing, Minister, you represent the two&hyphen;thirds shareholders even if this bill goes through to privatise one third. You ought to have this power for the Australian people.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(10.07 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I first looked at this issue, my immediate reaction was to believe that the minister should not have a power to direct. It seemed to me that the marketplace might indicate that it is less willing to pay the level of funds that we would expect to come from the partial sale of Telstra. On the other hand, after having looked at the matter for some time, I believe that the power should be there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Honourable senators will remember that some time earlier this week&mdash;I think it might have been Monday or Tuesday; I am not sure because the days seem to have merged this week&mdash;I indicated that I had been able to obtain a concession for certain centres in Queensland where operators are working and that those centres would remain open. That had quite a significant effect on some rural cities and towns in Queensland. I had that assurance. I also had an assurance about the number of operators who would be working in those centres up to June 1999. Those assurances came from both the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) and Mr Blount in writing. I indicated when I was speaking about them that I accepted those assurances, because if one has negotiations like that and assurances are not fulfilled, one does not enter into any further negotiations on other issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said then that I believed all senators in Queensland and all members of the House of Representatives from electorates with a centre where operators worked should monitor <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7123"> employment in those areas. That is something that my good colleague Senator Schacht did not acknowledge the other day. He just mentioned that I was asking the unions to fulfil that role.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the other hand, I looked at the power of the minister to direct. I will support Senator Schacht's amendment even though I believe that if that power is there, I do not think it will have to be used. If the power is there, it will be much more likely that I will not have to rely on assurances. I am indicating that, without that power to direct, I believe I could rely on them, but it will make it ever so much more definite that those assurances will be fulfilled. It is for that reason that I will be supporting Senator Schacht's amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(10.11 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have listened carefully to what has been said in this debate, as I hope I always do. I have listened to what Senator Schacht has said. I was also interested in what Senator Cook said. Senator Margetts made a contribution on this matter, as have a number of other people. I can understand what is being said about the fiduciary duties of directors of companies. The duty of directors of companies, be they under the Corporations Law or fully or partially owned by public shareholders, is clear. It is to act in the best interests of the company.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One would assume in this current instance, where 66&frac23;per cent of the directors are appointed by the representatives of the people, which is the electorate, that they would follow the interests of those people; namely, the public interest. One would have expected that. There are some arguments about that, and I have listened to them. At this stage, I am convinced by those arguments. My overall position in respect of this matter is that, had we not agreed with the one&hyphen;third sale of Telstra, the government would have accepted <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that as an invitation to commence cocking the trigger for a double dissolution. At that double dissolution, they would undoubtedly have taken the view to the people that there should be a total sale of Telstra, and that would have been the end of it. The only way they could get a total sale of Telstra through the parliament is to get it through the Senate. As the Senate is currently constituted, that would be impossible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The parliament has accepted the partial sale of Telstra. If at the end of this day&mdash;I hope this is the last day; this debate cannot carry on forever&mdash;the parliament has accepted the partial sale of Telstra, presumably one&hyphen;third of the directors will come from private shareholders, be they ordinary or preference shareholders. I reiterate what I said before. The one&hyphen;third sale can be so structured as to enable the appointment of directors nominated by preferential shareholders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The corollary is 66&frac23;per cent&mdash;I do not know how you would get the two&hyphen;thirds, but roughly 66 per cent&mdash;of the shareholders will be as shareholders representing the people and appointed by Order in Council, I should imagine. Certain questions have been raised and I think the government is taking it a little bit far to insist at this point of time that the Senate agree to excising section 9 of the act. That section, of course, contains the power of the minister to direct. I know that there will be arguments adduced. One of those, which came to mind yesterday, was that the rules of the ASX or the New York Stock Exchange may not enable the float to take place under those circumstances.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But that was something that I was not told by them; I was advised by one of my own advisers that maybe that is the sort of thing that might be put forward. It might be put forward, but the whole point is that I believe there are a large number of investors who are eager, are hungry for the sort of security and prosperity that this float will give them, particularly as the power has never previously been exercised by either the previous government or by this <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7124"> government, and account should be taken of that.

<STATE> (Tasmania)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(10.18 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with much of what has just been said. The move by the government to do away with the power of the minister to direct what will happen to Telstra after one&hyphen;third has been privatised may well upset the stock exchange, but Senator Harradine being able to say that just shows the direction that his vote and the vote for the sale of Telstra has taken the whole institution. It means that we will see the stock exchange basically having control over the direction of Telstra and telecommunications in this country and not the minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing that Senator Harradine said that is very pertinent here is that, although this power has been there for the minister in the past to direct Telstra, or before that Telecom, in the interests of Australian consumers, it has never been used. It is rather a symbolic gesture to that majority of people in the electorate who do not want the sale of Telstra that we are engaged in here. It is a fairly hollow gesture. I guess it is all that is left to cling to for those of us who are so vehemently against the loss of Telstra from the public domain into the hands of private shareholders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Harradine, by the way, has argued very strongly that the government had a mandate on this occasion to sell one&hyphen;third of Telstra and he felt compelled by that argument to side with the government to have Telstra sold. But then he totally contradicts himself in the next sentence by saying that he will not allow one per cent more of Telstra to be sold as far as he is concerned. Presumably the government is going to go for another mandate to sell the rest of Telstra at the next election. But if Senator Harradine is in here, he is going to vote against the government mandate next time round: vote for it this time, vote against it next time. It makes the argument about mandate specious.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other argument that is used is the one on double  disillusion. I was interested to hear <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Senator Kernot appealing across the way to Senator Harradine in particular to think again when last week he indicated that he was going to give his pivotal vote to the loss of one&hyphen;third of Telstra out of the public domain. The reality is that, just a week or two before, the Democrats had been using the same argument about a double disillusion to justify backing the government's legislation, effectively prohibiting secondary boycotts and work&hyphen;to&hyphen;rules campaigns in the workplace and ignoring appeals then to reconsider because of the enormous impact against the interests of the average working Australian and against many community organisations that that legislation is going to have after its proclamation on 1 January. Again, they are specious arguments. They do not hold water. They are not consistent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can give many other examples where governments might claim mandates, where there is majority support&mdash;on issues like abortion, rights for gay and lesbian people, the Franklin River issue, the protection of forests in Australia&mdash;and where there is an enormous preponderance of public feeling for these issues, but Senator Harradine consistently votes against them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that we are not seeing a vote here on the basis of what the government might or might not do, and we are not seeing a vote on the basis of the government getting a mandate or not getting a mandate. It is a considered vote on the basis of the ability to do a deal, which, whatever one might argue, has been done behind closed doors over a number of months using the power of a pivotal vote. That is what it is about. That is what the outcome is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would submit that, in the end, Tasmania is going to be a loser from this deal, that while there is a temporary benefit flowing in the direction of Tasmania there is no long-term protection at all for Tasmanian consumers once Telstra has gone into the private domain, once it is under the clear direction of the Stock Exchange&mdash;and it will be. Senator Harradine knows as well as I do and as well as everybody else does that the sale of one-third of Telstra will be converted to the sale <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7125"> of 100 per cent of Telstra a little further down the line.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Calvert opposite says, `How many jobs have we saved in Tasmania?' I am not going to be diverted by an interjection and stray very far from the topic. But he might begin by looking at the local employment initiatives which the Greens established after the fall of the Gray government, which left a record debt in Tasmania and record unemployment in 1989. Those local employment initiatives, run on a shoestring budget in Tasmania and designed by the Greens, have led to the establishment of hundreds of jobs and hundreds of small businesses in the most depressed areas of Tasmania. There is an example of what better we might be doing with public funding if we had it instead of handing it across to the private domain, as will occur with Telstra.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I finally want to say&mdash;because this is germane&mdash;again that I support Senator Schacht's amendment, but it is largely symbolic; it is largely a conscience saver for the Independents in particular over the loss of one-third of Telstra and the consequent loss of $1 billion per annum to the public purse from the income of Telstra, which will come out of that, because, as I said, this is stage one of a very deliberate government campaign to sell the whole of Telstra into private hands in the coming few years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as I am concerned, it is a pretty sad set of affairs. It is an enormous loss to public ownership and public control of a wonderful and basic utility which gives benefit to the lives of every Australian. This move will see the losses going on for decades and lifetimes. There is some money being arranged to benefit sections of the community&mdash;and, ostensibly, the Tasmanian community&mdash;up front and temporarily. But we are going to be the long-term losers out of this in terms of money and jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There it is. It is nice to be able to vote for this amendment of Senator Schacht, but it does not in any way ameliorate the long-term damage and loss to the Australian community as a whole, which has been occasioned by <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this government legislation and the critical vote of Senator Harradine and Senator Colston in allowing Telstra to be dismantled and, as a consequence, lose its public excellence and its public control.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are now dealing with stage one. We have stage two to come where Telstra will go onto the Stock Exchange, where it is going to basically advantage those people at the big and rich end of town, to the long-term disbenefit of poor people, rural people, people in regional areas, despite the biscuit that has been handed out temporarily, the immediate advantage. In the long term, those are the folk who are going to particularly suffer from the loss of Telstra through the passage of this legislation, which we must presume is going to occur a bit later today.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not impugning you. I am just saying that you are basing your conclusions on a misunderstanding. I am trying to say it in the kindest way possible. I am not voting for this legislation purely on the basis of a mandate. My view of a mandate I have expressed in this chamber time and time again. My view of a mandate is that this Senate does have an obligation not to simply <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7126"> obstruct legislation that comes from the other place pursuant to a government's mandate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of that legislation and in respect of our obligations to review and scrutinise that legislation, we should then apply certain principles&mdash;principles that we may variously have and principles that people know we stand upon. One of those principles in respect of this matter&mdash;I have repeated it time and time again&mdash;is that natural monopolies should overwhelmingly be in public hands. That was the principle that was applying to this legislation. Upon that principle I was then able to reluctantly agree with this legislation because it satisfied that principle and because at the end of this day Telstra will overwhelmingly be in the hands of the public. I wish to make that point to the committee.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a few brief comments. I have to say in passing that I do share Senator Harradine's concerns about the constant and repetitive nature of the ad hominem attacks that have been made on him by Senator Brown.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only matter that Senator Brown raised that is relevant to this particular debate is the argument that somehow rural users will be disadvantaged unless you have a power of direction. The government accepts that the board of Telstra is charged with the responsibility of directing the operations of the company in as competitive and commercial a manner as possible. To the extent that it is then necessary to protect rural users, we have a universal service fund, which is part of the USO arrangements, which is deliberately designed to ensure that rural users do benefit in a very tangible and practical way by having access to the standard telephone service at affordable prices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the parliament wants to go beyond that, as it has chosen to do in a number of ways, and if it wishes, as a result of this bill passing, to see a fund established that will provide <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> $250 million worth of benefits to rural users, it is quite clear that the parliament has an ongoing capacity to ensure that we do not have rural have-nots and second-class citizens. In fact, the prime motivation for our commitment to establish the fund is that for too long the governments of this country have been prepared to sit back and basically accept a situation where residents of capital cities do very nicely, thank you, in terms of up-to-date technologies but those in the bush lag far behind. We do not accept that that is an acceptable situation, and that is why the fund is directed at doing something about it. It is simply another practical example of how you can address those issues without needing a power of direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand Senator Colston's concerns. I make it crystal clear that the commitment that I have given is one on behalf of the government, not simply the minister of the day, and that Mr Blount's assurances should be viewed in a similar manner. I understand the concern that he has and Senator Harradine has to at least have a reserve power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Schacht very carefully avoided the nub of this issue&mdash;that is, what constitutes the national interest and in what circumstances you should use it or threaten to use it. If you think that that therefore gives you carte blanche to say, `We don't like the way the company's operating; it ought to act uncommercially and get out there and deliver services in a whole range of areas', I simply say to you that your government did not use that power for the same very good reason&mdash;it did not want to interfere with the commercial  practices of the company. But to the extent that you do want to redirect in various ways, you do that by legislation. It is transparent and it is structurally separate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand the majority view of the committee, but I simply want to put it on the record that we are concerned that the use of this power in the way that has been described would simply be an invitation for governments to be second-guessing the operations of the company in a very&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I recall, you put one question to me&mdash;that was whether the only reason for not wanting a power of direction was to increase the sale price. The answer to that is that that is not the reason. But you should bear in mind that those ordinary Australians who subscribe to the issue in good faith and are shareholders down the track would understandably have concerns at the prospect of another government taking the view that it should give very significant directions to Telstra to act in an uncommercial manner which would then adversely affect the value of that corporation&mdash;in other words, it would be asked to accept social obligations for which there would be no parliamentary recompense.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is an entirely different matter to saying, `The parliament wants to see a number of things done. The parliament wants to ensure that rural users get particular services and the parliament is prepared to pay for them.' But if you say that ordinary shareholders of Telstra ought to accept that financial burden, then you are diminishing the value of their shares.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I know its value is in staying in public control. I know that you are going to sell one&hyphen;third of Telstra to the market below its value. The market is going to make hundreds of millions of dollars, if not a couple of billion dollars, out of this sale because it will be sold below its value. That was the fate of CSL and that has been the fate of almost all other major public enterprises sold onto the market. The market gets the best of it and the scalpers in the middle, the middle people, will have their hundreds of millions of dollars taken out of it as well. I do know at least a bit about the value, while you say you know nothing. That is why the majority of the public in this country is so apprehensive about what you are doing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing is the minister's ability to direct, which will ostensibly be kept if this amendment were to prevail. The reality is that that power will not be used. As Senator Margetts interjected earlier, Senator Alston has confirmed that the government would not dare interfere in the operations of Telstra in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the interests of consumers, even though just one&hyphen;third of it was sold into public hands, because the market will say it cannot do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is not going to worry about its regional and its poorer consumers and their interests when it is going to have the big money sitting at business lunches with it saying, `You can't do that.' They will also get legal advice saying the government cannot do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again this amendment is a fairly hollow salving of the conscience for those of us who will be voting for it.

<PARA>These amendments extend coverage of the consumer service guarantee to carriage service providers&mdash;that is, in addition to the telecommunications carriers, which are currently Telstra, Optus and Vodafone. The effectiveness of the customer service guarantee is dependent on the extent to which it has coverage of the industry. The service provider sector is, as senators would be aware, the fastest growing part of the retail sector in the provision of telecommunications services, in terms of both revenue growth and customer numbers. Service providers are rapidly penetrating both small business and residential customer markets, particularly in the area of mobile telephony.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7130"> This is the sector of the industry which is attracting ever increasing consumer complaints. For example, on 5 December, just a few days ago, The ACCC put out a press release stating that they had acted to resolve a deluge of complaints by consumers against a particular telephony service provider&mdash;that was ACW Services. Professor Fels said they received so many complaints that it was impossible for the ACCC to individually respond to them all. According to the ACCC, ACW customers&mdash;many of whom are small business operators who rely heavily on tele phone services&mdash;may have had their telephone lines disconnected, even though they had paid their bills or had legitimate grievances with their bills from the ACW. This is an example of the difficulties that are being faced by consumers. If the customer service guarantee is to effectively alter corporate behaviour on a sufficiently wide basis, then inclusion of carriage service providers is very necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, in a submission to the Senate committee inquiry on the bill, the telecommunications industry ombudsman noted that he had been advised that the customer service guarantee was intended to apply to service providers from 1 July. But we do not see any reason why it should not apply now. I commend these amendments to the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This series of amendments allows regulation of service providers, not just carriers. It allows regulation of what those carriers do. We are talking about Internet. I know Senator Harradine has expressed concern over time in relation to the broadcast act, and that he has been interested in amendments to the broadcast act. But these amendments, to my understanding, will allow regulation of carriers as well as service providers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> It has always been my contention that this bill, in general, largely deals with telecommunications as it is, rather than telecommunications as it may be in the future. Therefore, it is really necessary that we allow that ability to make regulations for other service providers. For instance, there is the practice of spamming. I am not an expert in surfing the Internet, but spamming means that people can create inappropriate displays in public access conferences. There are many reasons why it may be inappropriate for such spamming to take place. If we leave wide open the ability to make regulations for what could be offensive or inappropriate access to public confer ences, then we may have a problem in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will be great for people to be able to regulate access. But it is important that there is the ability not only to regulate service providers but also to recognise that telecommunications is well beyond just the provision of telephone services. We have to at least be ready in this bill&mdash;I do not think we are anything like ready&mdash;to recognise that, if we have the ability to regulate carriers, we should also have the ability to regulate service providers. Carriers are the telecommunications carriers; service providers go well beyond that realm. Heaven knows what it might include in the future. I think we ought to at least be cognisant of what the range is now and be prepared to have the ability to make regulations in other areas.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will just address the merits of the issue. You have something in the order of 100 or more service providers at the present time. If you include Internet service providers, you have over 200 and they will be within the TIO scheme, at least on a voluntary basis, from now. Therefore, any complaints in relation to their conduct can be dealt with. But service providers are providing a level of service that is optional; in other words, if people do not like what a service provider has to offer, they go elsewhere or they decline the service altogether, whereas carriers are providing basic services, in other words services, that people need and cannot really go elsewhere for.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole concept of the customer service guarantee was to ensure that, where people are on the one hand entitled to a basic level of service, the standard telephone service, they should not be effectively disadvantaged by the fact that the carrier does not bother to turn up on time or does not install or maintain the phone except after a lapse of, in some instances, many months. That is the situation we are trying to address. We want to ensure that carriers who are providing essential services are required to do so within strict time limits and that penalties ought to apply if they do not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we are talking about extending that to service providers where you are talking about non&hyphen;basic services, where those services are entirely optional&mdash;in other words, if someone wants to offer you a service, it is a matter for you whether you take it or not; it is a matter for you on what terms you take it. If you do not like the price, the quality of the service, the after&hyphen;sale service, you do not take it. You have that choice. But you do not have that choice with basic services. This is designed to impose those obligations on the carriers who are providing those basic services.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not denying that the minister does raise some reasonable points. But the point is what service providers are <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and where they are going to be in the years ahead in the regime of telecommunications in Australia. There is no doubt that some commercial organisations who are essentially going to try and be carriers, in some form or another, will call themselves service providers to escape the obligations that carriers have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the merging of technologies, this is an issue that is not going to go away. It is an important issue. I have no doubt the ordinary consumer will not tell much difference between a carrier and a service provider. Because of the merging of technologies and what they are offering, in many cases, for a normal consumer&mdash;whether in small business or at the domestic level&mdash;they will not differentiate between a carrier and what the service provider is doing. When a customer has got a service provision from a service provider and it goes wrong, they will automatically ring Telecom, Optus or Vodafone&mdash;a carrier&mdash;and say, `We've got your phone in here, something's gone wrong.' They will ring the carrier first rather than the service provider.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The carriers will complain that they are going to get a lot of complaints that will be directed at them when it is in fact a fault of the service provider. Unless there is some new understanding that service providers cannot escape their commitment to good standards, et cetera, the carriers will be the ones bedevilled by it. I think both have an obligation. What the Democrats have raised here in this amendment is therefore worthy of support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It now looks like it will be sometime in March&mdash;because the committee inquiring into the post&hyphen;1997 deregulatory regime will not report till 25 February, by agreement between all parties&mdash;when the 600&hyphen;page legislation on the post&hyphen;1 July 1997 deregulatory model hits the Senate for debate, that this issue of the definition of the service provider will be debated. But as this bill will not be proclaimed&mdash;if it goes through according to Senator Harradine's amendment accepted by the government&mdash;till 1 May, that debate of course can take place. In my view, if it is amended here, we can revisit in March and April. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7132">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an issue that is going to have to be debated, because, the way service providers are proliferating, what they are offering to the community will actually confuse the consumer into believing that they are dealing with a carrier when in fact they are not dealing with a carrier. The carrier will be the one receiving the complaints and the telephone calls and the carrier will be the one expected to fix it. If they do not, someone will claim that, under the rules, they will be able to and the service provider will escape having to provide remedy for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unless you put the standard in now, or certainly by next year, we are going to have, in my view, an impossible imbalance between what carriers provide and their obligations and those of service providers. If you do not put this in, a lot of people who are going to be considered as carriers will try to declare themselves as service providers to escape the provisions of this bill. The way not to let them escape it is to amend it the way the Democrats have proposed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Schacht interjects, `Not very much.' If that is the sole means by which you can deal with complaints in relation to service providers, it does seem extraordinary. Usually an ombudsman or an <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ombudsperson has the ability to find or seek remedies based on a set of principles. All we are saying is that, if there is a set of principles by which carriers will operate and if you are to put so much emphasis on a telecommunications ombudsperson, you should enable them to have some basis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This does not require government to do anything, but it does retain the power for government to make regulations if such regulations are seen to be necessary. Otherwise, having a case-by-case remedy in each instance of complaint in relation to service providers will not be very satisfactory. It seems to me that we will get some sort of commercial anarchy and that there will be a number of people profiting, with a whole lot of people being unhappy or feeling that their rights have been removed.

Firstly, if there are complaints about a service provider who has failed&mdash;for example, in the case given by Senator Margetts&mdash;to properly advise potential customers of pricing arrangements or other sorts of customer guarantees, what action can the carrier take under existing legislation and under these provisions before us?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, has he given consideration to any of the items in this legislation which should perhaps be commenced on a date before 1 May or would more properly commence on a date before 1 May? The reason I put forward the date of 1 May was to deal specifically with the issue of the part&hyphen;privatisation of Telstra, the one-third sale of Telstra. It was linked with a motion that I will be moving shortly to establish a committee to consider the issue of redeemable preference shares.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(11.20 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the answer in relation to Senator Harradine's question about complaints regarding service providers is that the customer's agreement is with that service provider. To <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7135"> the extent that the contract allows the service provider to increase the charges, then by definition the carrier is allowed to do that. It may well be in some circumstances that customers would say, `I wasn't aware of that. I simply assumed that, when I signed up, the going rate would continue.' It becomes, I suppose, a difference between what people would reasonably expect and what the legal entitlements are.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be very surprising if any supplier of a service gave a guarantee that prices would never rise. It is then the extent to which they rise and the extent to which customers are prepared to continue dealing with that service provider that becomes relevant. So, at the end of the day, I think you would have to say that the dispute would remain one between the customer and the service provider.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You would normally expect that the customer could walk away if faced with a 100 per cent increase. But, again, if it is off a very low base and everyone else in the industry has raised prices to that extent, it may well be that that increase is reasonable in the circumstances. All I am saying is that customers need to be aware of what contract they are entering into.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After 1 July the codes of practice will go a long way towards ensuring that service providers, dealers and retailers are obliged to make that sort of information available, but at the end of the day it is not the responsibility of the carrier to keep a retailer honest. The customer's dealing is with the retailer, and the customer ought to be aware of that fact when entering into agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as the start&hyphen;up date is concerned, the view we have taken is that all of these improvements to customer benefits are ones that ought to apply to the new regime, in other words, from 1 July onwards. Certainly as far as the customer service guarantee on carriers is concerned, because there have been a lot of problems in the past about installation, maintenance and the like, we took the view that it was appropriate that they come into effect as soon as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Beyond that, it is reasonable to argue that we should have a new regime which includes <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a new consumer regime starting from 1 July. That is the debate we can have when the package comes back in February and March. If people want to argue that those ought to be brought forward, then that is the time to do it. Again, bear in mind that we are talking about a new regime. We are not talking about what ought to be applying as of now, unless you are simply putting aside the whole notion of the package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that that is the appropriate time to have that debate and we should not be simply imposing new obligations in an ad hoc manner on carriers and others who would reasonably have expected that the rules or the game would not change fundamentally until the middle of next year.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are talking about looking at the adequacy of those provisions. The Democrats are saying that they are not adequate because they do not just deal with Telstra, which would be one reason for saying that they are not appropriate in a sale bill, but nevertheless we have them there. They also deal with Vodafone and Optus. The point of this amendment is to simply make those provisions cover the very important and growing sector which is emerging.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would ask the minister to explain whether there are any practical or financial reasons why we cannot extend this or bring it forward.

The government found it appropriate to put it in the bill in the first place, so are there any practical or financial reasons for not doing so?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought I had said this several times. What we put into the bill were provisions in relation to existing carriers, because we took the view that in many instances people do not have any choice but to rely on the carriers for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7136"> the provision of the standard telephone service. If people cannot get a basic telephone line connected or maintained within a reasonable period, we take the view that that is not acceptable, and in many respects that probably should have been dealt with a long time ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To extend that notion to all service providers is putting a very different regime in place. It is putting a whole new set of customer obligations on a whole new set of players. The concept is fundamentally different. Those are optional services. They are not mandatory or essential services as are those provided by carriers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I gather from Senator Allison's facial contortions that she does not understand that distinction. The fact is that what we put into the bill was to strictly apply to carriers, to those who provide basic services. We did not put into the bill provisions that would cover the rest of the industry&mdash;all service providers&mdash;because we took the view that that is more properly something that ought to apply from 1 July onwards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You asked me about the financial implications of that. The answer is that all of those players in the game assumed that the post&hyphen;1997 package would put in place new and potentially more onerous obligations on retailers and providers of services. You are saying that they ought now be told that these obligations are going to be brought forward by a period of months. I simply say that that would therefore impose additional financial obligations on them in principle which they would pass on to customers. It really boils down to why you would want to put in place a new consumer regime prematurely when we have not even had the debate about what rules ought to apply post&hyphen;1997.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>I am not sure that I have all the details correct. One of the complaints starting to emerge about having a service provider is that sometimes the charge for the service provider is mixed in with the carrier's bill. I have heard that when a service provider reaches an agreement with the carrier, the carrier may say, as part of the agreement, that the billing arrangement should be in the same document from the carrier. But when it goes wrong, the carrier is left with the problem. If the service provider has gone broke, the carrier is left with sorting out the mess of any obligations that that service provider had under the contract they signed with the consumer. The consumer, who signed in good faith and was not expecting them to go broke, says, `Listen Telstra. You had them under your arrangements. You ought to meet the obligation to provide the service.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why we raised this issue of the service provider before. It is getting to the very nub of some of these issues regarding the service providers. You can say that this will be dealt with adequately in the post&hyphen;1997 bill. However, in the meantime, you are putting in here the carrier. If you proclaim this separately, the carriers could have a bigger obligation for a period&mdash;it may not be many months&mdash;and be tangled up with problems of service providers. Because service providers are excluded under these amendments, the carrier may well have to carry the obligation. You might say that that is bad luck for six months to Telstra, Optus and Vodafone, but I am not sure they would say that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer is that the customer service guarantee does not deal with billing; it deals with strict time limits on installation and maintenance. When we are talking about billing problems, section 38 and that amendment, you would have to say that if a carrier enters into an agreement with a retailer or service provider whereby the carrier does the billing, the carrier wears it. If something goes wrong, it is the carrier's fault, and the customer is entitled to look to that carrier. If the carrier feels that it has been left holding the baby, it ought to think twice next time before it enters into such an arrangement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment to section 38 is designed to require Austel to get on with the business of drawing up indicative performance standards, which would presumably then be reflected in industry codes. So you are starting to develop a system. It may well provide for that situation. Where the carrier agrees with the service provider to do all of the billing, the carrier accepts certain obligations. In some countries, such as New Zealand, where there is a dispute, it is treated as being in the customer's favour. You do not have to pay the bill until it is sorted out. You could have some sort of variation on that theme and say that the carrier has this responsibility. If the carrier wants to take third party proceedings against a service provider, so be it, but it is not the concern of the customer. What we are trying to do in beefing up section 38 is to get Austel working on indicative performance standards, which can then be translated into a new industry approach. Presumably, that would then be part and parcel of the post&hyphen;1997 regime.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA>This amendment enables Austel to develop standards of its own accord. We think this is important because it may prevent a situation arising where the regulator can arbitrarily be constrained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has argued in the explanatory memorandum to the bill that Austel should be prevented from making a standard unless directed to do so by the minister. This is because it may not be appropriate for all telecommunications services, such as services used only by large corporate customers, to be subject to performance standards. The government has, therefore, proposed that the minister have the power to direct Austel to impose standards in relation to services where regulatory attention is required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We agree that the minister should have the power to direct Austel in this matter. We also agree that it may not be appropriate for all telecommunications services to be subject to performance standards. However, we do not believe that this is best achieved by preventing Austel from acting without ministerial direction. There are other ways of ensuring that inappropriate services are not regulated without unnecessarily constraining the regulatory review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem with the government's proposal is that it may unnecessarily constrain the regulator from being proactive and from acting in the best interests of customers in cases where the minister, for whatever reason, chooses not to do so. The regulator will often be better placed than the minister to determine which services require regulatory attention. For this reason, we see no reason for preventing the regulator from being proactive and from developing appropriate performance standards. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having to wait for ministerial direction could be problematic if the minister were disinterested, did not have the information or whatever. But the concern that inappropriate telecommunications services might be made subject to performance standards we think is misguided. Section 87E(6) of schedule 1 requires that every such standard be subject to parliamentary disallowance. In other words, if the parliament is satisfied that any standard is inappropriate, they can simply disallow it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what you propose is to allow Austel to go off and develop performance standards where there may not be community concern and where we in this parliament might be more concerned that the actual costs of developing those standards in areas might be at the expense of other work that we think Austel ought to be doing.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things that is going to occur in the deregulatory environment post&hyphen;1 July next year and with the proliferation of communications, mergings of technology, et cetera, is, I suspect, ongoing demand from the community&mdash;almost incessant&mdash;for standards and so on. Though we might call it deregulation, we will end up with a lot more regulation than <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people have ever had before in telecommunications. It will run to thousands of pages. We both know that. That is the irony of when we talk about deregulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not reducing paperwork; let us make this quite clear. The only way you had no paperwork was when Telstra was one monopoly operating on its own on behalf of the government; and then you did not worry about regulation on competition policy, access rules, et cetera&mdash;you just went ahead and did it&mdash;or even worry about consumer protection. We are now going to have a very complicated arrangement. Therefore, if the other legislation goes through, the regulatory functions will go to the ACCC.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The next thing is the priority. I say in reply to Senator Harradine's interjection that when we get to this other bill in March next year, I think we will have to look at the priority we set for the telecommunications section as the regulator with the ACCC. It has to be proactive and it has to have enough resources. That is the part of that debate to handle this issue of setting the standards. But I do think it is not unreasonable, even allowing for the ACCC, for it to have this power of its own initiative, remembering that we can disallow it.</PARA></TALK.START>

He will make that judgment. He will have informal discussions with people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I do not think it is an unreasonable power to have. I would not support this if it were not a disallowable instrument. I would then support it only if it were at the direction of the minister. In this case, on the advice received, this is not an unreasonable provision to allow Austel to develop standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suspect Austel is going to be swamped with demands for standards as the service providers proliferate in the ever&hyphen;growing range of telecommunications merging with such services as broadcasting, et cetera. I think a proactive regulator, which is what we need, should have this power so long as it is a disallowable instrument subject to the parliament's say.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) has made some points to this chamber which, to some extent, would influence me to vote against this proposition. Senator Schacht has raised the question of the communications division of the ACCC.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My concern with a lot of this is that the question will ultimately come down to how competition is operating. For example, in the area of standards, in relation to the material offered to service providers through carriers&mdash;whether or not it is indecent or obscene&mdash;it unfortunately appears to be going the way where the question will be determined on whether or not it meets competition requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My view is that you do not let the ACCC go on its merry way to do all of its studies and forget the priorities in these areas. Those priorities are more likely to reflect the community views if they are determined by the minister. It is the minister who tells the regulator&mdash;Austel, in this case&mdash;the areas it should be considering. That, in my view, will <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> be taken away from the minister if this amendment is carried.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will get to the argument about the ACCC if we get to that debate in March or April. I make the simple point&mdash;and I agree with what the minister has said&mdash;that it has operated quite well thus far. There are limited amounts of finance around the place. You may have a body such as Austel making standards, having inquiries, running loose and diverting money to its priorities rather than to the priorities of the people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I acknowledge what Senator Schacht has said. These standards are disallowable by either house of parliament, but that does not get to the point that has been raised by the minister. In my view, it does not get to the point that I am raising now&mdash;the question of priorities. Those priorities are more likely to be those of the people if they are expressed by the minister, because he or she is answerable to the parliament and, ultimately, to the people. Whilst it is not a big deal, I certainly will not be voting for this amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What if the parliament and the government decided not to direct Austel at all? What if the government decided to ignore consumer concerns? What if it decided not to direct Austel to save money, for instance? There are a number of scenarios that you could raise here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is quite ironic that the minister talks about this leading to a possible blow-out and that questions of resources for Austel have come up in the same week that a new draft telecommunications national code has been released. The code asks Austel to do a whole range of things in relation to monitoring cable roll-out and intervening&mdash;or at least being involved&mdash;in disputes between carriers, which would oblige Austel to use a great deal of resources. Apparently the government has not taken any steps to increase those resources for Austel. So it is somewhat ironic to be talking about the concern over this amendment being about money and about blow-outs and about lack of resources when the government is making those demands on Austel at the same time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we are not talking about taking away the power of the minister to direct. That is very clearly still part of the legislation and the act. What we are talking about here is what happens if the government chooses not to do that.

<PARA>These amendments increase the maximum amount of damages payable for contraventions covered by each of the performance standards from the proposed $3,000 to now $25,000. They also ensure that the penalty is upgraded at least once every four years in line with the consumer price index.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will deal with them in two groups, as I gather we will be when we vote on them. On the indexation of damages, I would not die in the ditch on this one. Austel could be expected to review the scale of damages as a matter of course, so it follows from that that there is no need for a four&hyphen;yearly indexation in amendment 12. The indexation requirement does not make sense in a situation where new requirements are going to be progressively added to a standard over time in any event. My advice is that amendment 13 would not be legally effective to provide indexation of the statutory cap because the wording is insufficient to achieve that outcome. I think those two amendments are simply superfluous. By all means, if you nonetheless want to argue that there should be a four&hyphen;year review rather than anything else, say that that is the way it goes. It just seems to me that you are much better to have, in effect, a standing review rather than indexation on some sort of arbitrary four&hyphen;year basis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as damages are concerned, the maximum provision that we have included of $3,000 is a balance you strike when you are trying to ensure that, essentially, residential and small business customers get the services they ought to get. In other words, it is not really a matter of collecting penalties. You would hope that the penalty provisions do not come into operation because the carriers will deliver the goods; in other words, that they will get out there and install and connect and keep appointments. But, once you get beyond something like $3,000&mdash;and now, as I understand it, the Democrats have accepted a $25,000 figure for every breach&mdash;you are potentially talking about very substantial windfalls. It is quite disproportionate to the nature of the offence.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. As you would probably be aware, the courts fix the penalty by reference to the maximum. In other words, if the maximum is $500, they will say, `In the overall scheme of things, parliament doesn't regard this as terribly serious. It's a first offence. You'll probably be fined half of that.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you say $10 million for a breach of the telecommunications code, the court knows that the parliament regards this as a very serious offence. It will be much more likely, therefore, to impose a pretty substantial penalty. If you fix a figure of $25,000, not only are you saying it is serious but also you are potentially providing significant windfall to residential consumers who, at the end of the day, should have got the installation or the service on time. Right?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what we are all aiming to achieve. We want them to get the service, so we do not want any money to change hands. But, to the extent that there is a breach of that, what you do not then want is something that is quite disproportionate in terms of compensation, where you are effectively giving them a very substantial sum of money. All I am arguing is that you ought to set the penalty proportionate to the issue that is of concern. Here, the concern is to install and maintain. We are not talking about criminal offences. We are talking about&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate that. I have just said that the maximum amount sets the framework in which penalties will be applied. If it is $3,000 and it is a breach of one or two days, they may well award something of the order of $1,000 or $2,000 which, in the scheme of things, is not bad compensation. You did not get your phone connected straightaway; you had to wait a couple of days. Because you did not get that you got $1,000 or $2,000. But if you say to the courts, `Well, the maximum isn't $3,000; the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> maximum is eight times that,' you are really inviting the courts to say, `Well, if they're one or two days late, we'll give you a cheque for $10,000.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that that is quite disproportionate to the harm that has been caused to the consumer. By all means, and as I stressed, we do not want money changing hands here. It is only a last resort arrangement. But, to the extent that it does result in a fine being imposed, it ought not be such a significant penalty that you are effectively putting a burden that will ultimately be transferred through to consumers anyway. To the extent that there are significant problems in this area, presumably the costs that are borne by the carriers are passed on to consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does not seem right to me that a consumer who misses out by only a day or two could be getting a windfall profit to that extent. You have to make a judgment about what is reasonable. It seems to us that $3,000 is reasonable. If you had said $5,000, I probably could have accepted that, but $25,000 just seems to me to be quite out of line. If you want to go back to $5,000, I could wear that, I think, but I could not accept $25,000.</PARA>

While we have gone, from the opposition's point of view, up to $25,000&mdash; <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7148">that is a maximum&mdash;I think the public complain, in general, that the courts or the judicial bodies, or whatever, usually never go anywhere near imposing maximum penalties. That has often caused complaints from the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just want to get one thing clear. Is the penalty here imposed by Austel? I do not think it can be, constitutionally. It is by the court, isn't it? It is a proper court? So it is not Austel, because that would be a breach of the constitution, as I understand it, if the regulator were imposing the penalty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that Austel would set the scale to a maximum&mdash;if this was carried&mdash;of $25,000. Is that right? They would set the scale so that, if a telephone connection had gone bad or was missed by a day, that might be worth, in your case, $500 or $50.

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And actually in many cases went bankrupt, I have to say that $25,000 would still be a very small amount given the CoT cases that I have heard and the people that have had come to see me. I know this was an old regime of Telstra or Telecom or PMG, going back many years where they had a feeling that they were above any service to consumers, but there is no doubt, Minister, that there are cases in those CoT case groups for which $25,000 would be a very, very modest penalty. Telstra would be delighted to get away with paying only $25,000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know of a case from Yorke Peninsula, in South Australia, where a constituent is claiming that, over a period of 10 years, the lack of quality in the telephone system in the local exchange cost him business. He is claiming losses, over a 10-year period, of over $1 million in lost business opportunity. He was running a motel&hyphen;hotel. When people rang to make bookings they would hear the phone ringing, but it would not ring at the hotel. This went on for a decade. This is one of the CoT cases. He consistently complained to Telstra&mdash;or Telecom as it then was.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He is now pursuing a civil suit and perhaps will get a settlement. As he has worked it out, he believes that it has cost him at least $1 million worth of business in lost bookings. He says that you can trace the drop-off in bookings. Then, when you chase up Telstra, there is some mumbling answer and perhaps something further a month or so later. A $25,000 penalty on that sort of lack of service and the inability to deal with it is a very modest amount. I have to say that, if it were not for the CoT cases of which I have heard, I probably would have accepted your argument on $3,000 to $5,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But even with $25,000 being the only penalty that Telstra, Optus or Vodafone as carriers can suffer whilst getting away with this type of service&mdash;and, all right, you might say they can still sue for civil damages, and so on&mdash;that is cheap. Telstra has very deep pockets, as all the CoT case people know. You go to the civil court to get remedy and Telstra, because it has deep pockets running into billions, of course, can hang you out to dry and delay the court hearing for years and years so that your legal expenses as a small business person run up and up. In the end, you go bankrupt before you get remedy. If Telstra have to pay $25,000, in many cases they would say, `Gee, this is a cheap price to pay if it clears the issue.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Also, a penalty of this size, as Senator Margetts quite rightly interjects, may make them become a little more interested in dealing with these complaints properly and quickly, and accepting that there is a problem. We have seen in all of these CoT cases with which the ombudsman has dealt that the bureaucracy of Telstra has gone out of its way to delay. I have to say that in the end the bureaucracy of Telstra, Optus and Vodafone, as the three carriers, and other carriers to come will all be the same. You will not get officials and middle level management automatically conceding that they have made a mistake. They will try to hang it out. They will try to tell senior management, `No, no, there's no problem,' and try to starve the complainant out in one form or another.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7149">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In view of the CoT case examples, I think the $25,000 is a very modest amount&mdash;and it is the maximum. In many of the cases that the minister raises about being three days or one day late with connection, and so on, a small penalty might be a $50 fine; that is reasonable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, Minister, take for example the publication of the Yellow Pages with a business name and telephone number having accidentally been left out, with there being no reprint for 12 months. Any small business will tell you that the most effective form of advertising they have in Australia is having their name and a small ad in the Yellow Pages. If you miss out with a mistake having been made, though you have paid your money and lodged the ad, and so on, $500 would not be enough. If your name were to be omitted from the Yellow Pages in those circumstances, perhaps a $20,000 fine or penalty would be the equivalent of the resultant loss of business. But of course, the court would take account of the scale and the penalty would be imposed according to the seriousness of the breach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not asking for $25,000 for everyone; we are asking for `from between $1 and $25,000'. Minister, I have to say that, if it were not for the CoT cases, I would be willing to accept $3,000 or $5,000. But the CoT cases have convinced me that, unless you put some penalty on these big carriers, they will do in the small business people and the domestic service people. Now with the provision of Internet and interactive services, and so on, where more and more people will be doing business from home, you only have to get this wrong for two or three days and someone will go out of business and go bankrupt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You might say that is still a pretty harsh penalty to impose on the carriers, but that is the business they are in. They ought to accept that this is what we expect if we want an efficient, effective economy, equitably treating people, whether domestic or business, big or small. I could be criticised, I think, by some of the CoT case people for the figure of $25,000 being still too small.

<STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(12.45 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australia's system of compulsory voting has become an issue for discussion and I would like to put my thoughts about this matter on record in the Senate today. I am a classical Liberal. I believe in the individual, in the right of the individual to conduct their affairs without undue interference from the heavy hand of government and in freedom of choice. I can see that the Australian laws which make voting in state and federal elections compulsory and impose penalties for non-compliance could be regarded as coercive. Nevertheless, I support the Australian system of compulsory voting for state and federal elections.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> In view of my preamble, one may ask why I hold this view, given that it appears to be inconsistent with my basic political philosophy. I support compulsory voting because I believe the case for compulsory voting is so compelling as to override the philosophical considerations which would otherwise predetermine my views. In my view, there are four strong arguments in favour of the reten tion of our present system of compulsory voting. I would like to deal with them each in turn.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, there is what might be called the `democracy is a fragile flower' argument. If one casts one's eyes around the world, and more particularly around our own region, one will see that there are very few genuinely democratic nations, as we in Australia understand the meaning of political democracy to be. Given this, it is fair to describe democracy as a very fragile flower. The fragile flower of democracy has been able to survive in only a few nations because thoughtful people have understood its fragility and have been careful to protect and nurture that fragile flower that we know as democracy so as to ensure that it does not wither and die.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The democratic freedoms we enjoy in Australia today have not occurred, as some people appear to imagine, because Australia is some uniquely fair and egalitarian utopia where it has been seen as natural to respect the rule of law and the rights of others and where democratic processes of government are as naturally a part of the Australian ethos as our unique native flora, like the kangaroo paw or the gumtree. No; the truth of the matter is that democracy&mdash;the democracy which we in Australia have so easily inherited&mdash;is the legacy of hard battles fought over centuries to establish the rule of law and respect for human rights and to give the common man political rights over kings and, in this century, various kinds of dictators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The democracy we enjoy is the end result of a great struggle by persons who have shown exceptional courage and even given their lives in the pursuit of the freedoms which we enjoy today. The struggle for democratic rights goes back to the Magna Carta, the American Declaration of Independence, the French Revolution and those who fought for universal franchise, and includes the great struggles in this century against fascism and communism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given all of this, it is surely not too much to ask that the Australian people, as the inheritors of the benefits of these struggles for democracy, should be required to focus on the rights they enjoy once every three or four <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7151"> years by being required by law to go to a polling place and cast a vote. If one wanted to take a little poetic licence, one could say that the Australian law requiring compulsory voting is in fact a compulsory act of homage to the memory of all of those who struggled, suffered and gave their lives so that we could decide who should control the vast power and resources of the state by the simple act of ordinary citizens marking a ballot paper in the privacy of a polling booth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, compulsory voting means that Australians not only get the government they deserve but also get the government they want. The uniquely Australian combination of compulsory voting and preferential voting means that an Australian election is a more complete assessment of the political mood of the citizens than occurs in almost any other country. This is an important point. In effect, the combination of compulsory and preferential voting means that general elections in Australia are a unique poll of the political mood of the Australian people in which almost all of the Australian citizenry participate and which furthermore measures through the preferential voting system all the shades of grey in political opinion in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, there is the matter of Australian apathy. I spent eight years in local government in WA, where voting in local government elections is optional. The voter turnout for local government elections in Western Australia varies from around 13 per cent to 18 per cent of those on the common electoral roll, which covers local, state and federal elections.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think it is too much to say that the percentage of voter turnout for local government elections can be regarded as an indicator of the percentage of people who would vote in state and federal elections, were voting optional. Low voter turnouts of this level could mean that political groups representing non-mainstream interests could achieve a sufficient percentage of the poll to have members elected to parliament. I know there are those who would say that the Greens have already done this in this parliament. But the Greens achieved their quota only with the preferences of a major party. What I am <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> talking about is an extreme minority group achieving a quota in their own right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As an example, a few years ago there was a racist group in Western Australia led by a Mr Van Tongeren who went around painting anti&hyphen;Asian graffiti on bus stops in metropolitan Perth and, more seriously, burning down Chinese restaurants. Van Tongeren was eventually convicted of ordering the murder of one of his erstwhile followers who had disagreed with him and he is now in gaol in Perth. All in all, these were very unsavoury people whose activities were frightening, to say the least, because they demonstrated a total lack of respect for the values of our society and the rule of law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of relevance to this discussion, Van Tongeren had planned to stand candidates in the WA state elections and it is feasible that, with a voter turnout in the region of 15 per cent and a well organised system of getting their supporters to polling places, Van Tongeren could have been successful in winning seats in the state parliament. Similarly, in the Senate, low voter turnout could mean that well organised minority groups who would normally have no hope of election could be successful in obtaining the necessary quota to elect a senator or senators who would otherwise never be elected by the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fourthly, there is the impact that non&hyphen;compulsory voting would have on political campaigning. Two weeks before this year's presidential elections in the United States, I watched a television report on President Clinton out campaigning. Interestingly, the President was not talking about issues. He was instead pleading for his supporters to go to the polling place and actually vote. Similarly in the United Kingdom, the political parties spend an enormous amount of time and effort in election campaigns attempting to get their supporters to the polling places to vote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of this effort comes at a cost. Cars have to be provided, telephone calls have to be made and in general a great deal of additional expense is incurred in just getting the voters to attend polling booths, whereas by contrast under our present system of compulsory voting, electors in Australia simply know that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7152"> they have to go and vote as a matter of course. A corollary of this is the question of the potential for corruption in the offering of inducements to people to go and vote for particular candidates. Under the present system, such corruption is not an issue that needs to be dealt with, and I for one prefer to see it kept that way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most importantly, all of this means that there is less focus on issues in countries where voting is not compulsory, just as I observed in the US presidential elections at the end of the campaign; President Clinton was not focusing on issues but was pleading for his supporters to vote. This is surely not what we want to see in Australia. I thought it would be interesting to see what happens in other countries. The argument is sometimes put that the Australian voting system is a bizarre aberration, not followed anywhere else in the world. For the record there are some 20 countries in the world which have compulsory voting for all or part of the population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to the Australian Electoral Commission report of August 1996, countries with compulsory voting include the following; Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Cyprus, the Dominican Republic, Egypt, Greece, Guatemala, Honduras, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Panama, the Philippines, Singapore, Switzerland, Uruguay and Venezuela. So Australia has some notable companions in having compulsory voting, in particular Austria, Belgium and Switzerland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I believe that compulsory voting has many things in its favour and that not least of these is that compulsory voting means that the act of voting is in effect a statement of respect for the democratic processes which we enjoy in Australia. Furthermore, the combination of compulsory and preferential voting means that the end result of a poll in Australia is that a uniquely accurate measurement has been made of the political mood of the Australian people, allowing for all shades of grey and variations of view. One can truly say that the Australian people not only get the government they deserve, but also the government that most represents a consensus of their views&mdash;in short, the government they want. I see no <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reason to change our present system and I hope that the merits of compulsory preferential voting will be understood both by the people of Australia and our political leaders so that our system of voting will be retained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just to summarise my reasons for this in the minute or so that I have left, my position in support of compulsory voting is based on, firstly, the idea that democracy is a very fragile flower and that it is not too much to ask the Australian people to focus on their democratic heritage by requiring them to vote in general elections. Secondly, the Australian system of compulsory and preferential voting is unique and means that the Australian people not only get the government they deserve, but also the government they want. Thirdly, there is the question of Australian apathy. Voter turnout for local government elections in WA is 13 per cent to 18 per cent. Were this the case in state and federal elections, it would mean&mdash;or could mean&mdash;that undesirable minority parties could gain representation. Finally, there is the effect on political campaigns. Non&hyphen;compulsory voting would mean less focus on issues and an undue emphasis on getting voters to the polling booths. Therefore, it would increase the cost of campaigns, in terms of both getting people to the polls and perhaps offering inducements, which carries with it the attendant risk of corruption.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The way in which the Victorian casino licence was issued by the Kennett government represents a travesty of justice. The conduct and the findings of the Senate select committee inquiry into the Victorian casino do not diminish my belief that that was the case&mdash;in fact, they confirm it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The obstacles faced by this Senate committee confirm what the people of Victoria already know. More and more Victorians now understand that to get on in that state you need to have good connections with the Liberal Party machine. If you have criticisms of the government, you will need to keep those criticisms to yourself and not to criticise or even question. In fact, the stench of corruption hangs right over that state.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7153">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Victorian Liberal Party machine&mdash;its office holders, its business associates and allies&mdash;has geared into action to create an overt and covert climate of fear and intimidation, and the unanswered questions about the casino licence are only part of that scenario. It is my view that only a royal commission or judicial inquiry can clear up the substantive and very serious allegations that surround the Crown Casino affair. Only a royal commission or judicial inquiry can restore the confidence that the Australian people should have in their public institutions and public office bearers in the state of Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australians expect to be able to trust their politicians. I am afraid that the casino licence affair, in so far as the granting of a significant and highly profitable licence is concerned, is a flagrant abuse of that trust that Australians could rightly expect to have. It was probably one of the most profitable contracts ever granted to the private sector by a Victorian government. There are unresolved and substantive issues concerning public confidence in the probity of the Australian tendering process. They remain unresolved while there are outstanding claims concerning the granting of the Victorian casino licence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the Senate select committee inquiry into the casino took the correct decision in view of the legal ambiguity surrounding the calling of particular witnesses and the asking of particular questions, the fundamental issues that led to the establishment of that inquiry remain. While potential witnesses to that inquiry have been intimidated into silence by fear of prosecution or persecution by the Victorian government, the issues still remain. The Victorian Premier told the Senate inquiry that the state of Victoria would assert its executive privilege against the actions of the Commonwealth which threaten its autonomy or curtail its capacity to function effectively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why is the Victorian government so anxious to silence its critics? Why is there such a keen interest to prevent public examination of the claims that have been made concerning the serious lack of probity within the tendering process within Victoria? Why is it that Mr Kennett was so anxious to avoid public accountability for what has now become one <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the most lucrative contracts ever awarded by the state government?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we all understand that these issues remain highly controversial. I do not think there can be any doubt about that whatsoever. That was demonstrated in a recent visit to the Victorian shadow minister for gaming, Mr Rob Hulls, by officials of ITT Sheraton, Mr Jim Gallagher and Mr Mark Thomas, who is the Vice&hyphen;President and Director of Corporate Development for ITT. They told the shadow minister that ITT Sheraton would be reluctant to be involved in further tenders for any government contract anywhere in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That came, of course, as a direct result of their experience with the tendering process for the Victorian casino licence. They confirmed that they believed that the tender process was corrupted. They also confirmed that ITT did not bid for the Sydney casino licence because of the unfair advantage that Crown Casino received in the Melbourne bidding process. That international business confidence in the Australian tendering process has been shaken by the actions of the Victorian government should, in itself, be sufficient to concern the Commonwealth government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why is it so difficult to get witnesses to give evidence to the Senate inquiry? Why is it that public servants in Victoria fear crossing the Premier? This could be understood when one looks at the treatment dished out to anyone who dares to take an independent position, even where that independent position is required by their statutory responsibilities. We can look at the case of judges, equal opportunity commissioners, public prosecutors or auditors&hyphen;general.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Auditor&hyphen;General in his report this year noted that the Victorian government provided a gift of $174 million to the casino through its approval by the Treasurer of the expansion of the gaming facilities at that casino. The Victorian government's response has been to seek to clip the wings of the Auditor&hyphen;General by the appointment of board of review. Is it not amazing that two of the three persons involved in that review are persons who have been under review by the Auditor&hyphen;General? One of those persons&mdash;surprise, surprise&mdash;was a director of Crown Casino.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7154">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Victorian police have voiced grave reservations concerning the level of probity undertaken by the VCCA, and have made these concerns public only to find that they have been targeted for an attack by a vindictive premier. On 30 May 1996, I was contacted directly by senior police and advised of concerns within the Victorian police. It was asserted that these concerns were fobbed off by the VCCA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Police have confirmed to me that the concerns expressed by the then Assistant Commissioner for Crime, Neil O'Loughlin, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of 18 May 1994 were held widely throughout the police force. Specifically, police have confirmed to me the claim that, due to tight timelines, the VCCA probity checks on staff at the casino were inadequate, resulting in reduced security standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These claims were supported by Mr David Jones, the head trustee of Tattersall's, who said that there were double standards operating for Tattersall's and the casino in relation to security standards imposed by the VCCA. Mr Jones has stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rules appeared to be changed overnight for the casino and the casino seemed to have more political clout than Tattersall's.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a quote that appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Age</EMPHASIS>  on 18 February 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Police sources have alleged that 43 casino employees failed Victorian police probity checks and that the casino management overruled police recommendations not to employ these people. Two cases put to me specifically were of a croupier who was employed at the casino despite being charged with kidnapping, armed robbery and drug trafficking, and the employment of a former employee of a US gaming company operating on the Florida gaming boats who had a criminal record for theft.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Victoria Police gaming and vice squads were responsible for assisting the VCCA with probity checks on the bidding consortia. The police were called and given only one hour to check the VCCA probity reports at the time of the granting of the original licence. Police sources have stated to me that 20 probity related questions were raised with the VCCA <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> about the Crown Casino bid, but they were rejected. An <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> report said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Police were told that the matters did not concern them and that no further investigation would be required. Police say their inquiries may not have negated the granting of the licence, but they needed to be done.</PARA>
<PARA>Among those matters were the dealings of Mr Lloyd Williams who, as managing director of Dominion Properties, was fined for paying secret commissions to the former secretary of the Builders Labourers Federation&mdash;a clear breach of section 175 of the Crimes Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of police officers were involved in both the probity checks of the bidding consortia and later of Crown employees. Recent advice from gaming squad sources indicates that considerable pressure has been exerted by the Victoria Police Internal Affairs Branch upon staff involved with the VCCA probity investigations to ensure that information on the processes is not made public. I am advised that correspondence has been circulated stating that officers will be charged for any disclosure of information on the probity processes and that senior officers will also be liable for disciplinary action if their subordinates are party to disclosure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also alleged that officers' telephone logs are being monitored by Internal Affairs to stop police speaking to the media or to members of parliament. Police have stated that their concern is with proper police ethics&mdash;and that is the basis on which I have been contacted&mdash;and with proper procedures, not with party political advantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was invited to speak to an officer&mdash;a senior sergeant in the homicide squad&mdash;who had formerly been involved in the probity checks at the casino. On 3 June I rang the said officer. He was very helpful and indicated that he had been directly involved in the probity checks with the Casino Control Authority. Within a few days&mdash;that is, on 5 June&mdash;the Premier, Mr Kennett, referred in the Legislative Assembly to my conversation with the member of the Victorian police force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it interesting that a conversation between an officer of the Victorian police and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7155"> the Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate which concerned my public duties should be referred to by the Premier in the Legislative Assembly. I would ask a simple question: why is it that such a matter attracts the personal attention of the Premier? What is the mechanism by which the alleged details of my conversation were transmitted from an officer to the Premier? How common is it for discussions of this type to be raised in parliament? What is the impact on other persons who have a potential to assist an inquiry such as that undertaken by the Senate?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is it also not remarkable that unsuccessful bidders to the casino licence who have raised concerns about the tendering process were awarded substantial contracts and subsequently have not pursued their complaints concerning the tendering process? I will put the two things together. On the one hand, those that seek to publicly criticise this government are pilloried and quite serious threats are made to them by very senior officials of the government. On the other hand, there are inducements made to critics in terms of government contracts. Overall, it is not surprising that you will not find a lot of information concerning these contracts put on the public record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What sort of message is the premier seeking to send to those that are critical of his government? We could take the example of the planning firm, Phillips, Cox and Anderson. It has been advised through the various networks that if it wishes to attract government contracts, particularly those associated with the agenda 21 program in Victoria, it should cease its criticisms of the planning processes undertaken for the Crown Casino development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The public record suggests that the tendering process was contaminated in Victoria. The SBC Barry Domingues report highlights the fact that grounds for the granting of the Crown licence were matters other than financial. How did Hudson Conway know to lift its bid at a strategically critical moment to secure the contract on grounds&mdash;as I say, on the basis of SBC Barry Domingues' findings&mdash;that were other than financial? Why was it that, within three months of the casino licensing documents being signed with Crown, the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> planning department received details of the massive expansion of the permanent casino site, details of which were not contained in the prospectus? And such details were publicly welcomed by the senior officials within the government but they were not contained within the prospectus for the issue of shares? In fact, this happened within two weeks of their announcement, and nine days after the application list closed for Crown shares, and seven days after the application list closed for the Crown notes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is little wonder that Mr Rand Arashog, National President and Chief Executive Officer of ITT Sheraton, wrote to the chairman of the Victorian Casino Authority highly critical of the variation clause contained within the management agreement with Crown Casino. Naturally, he took offence at the suggestion that no matter how extensive or fundamental the changes were within the planning arrangements for the casino, the winning applicant was able to secure those changes and rival bidders were not given the opportunity to pursue their claims. Why were different planning mechanisms undertaken for Crown and the other bidders for the casino?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, ITT Sheraton remains prepared to provide evidence to a properly constituted judicial inquiry, or royal commission, and I suggest that that is the appropriate vehicle by which this parliament should now be pursuing these actions. The state government's subcommittee on the casino, headed by the Premier, did, according to the available public evidence, engage in a regular two&hyphen;way contact between the government and the gaming authority. And despite public denials that no such arrangements were made, this was confirmed by the memorandum from Mr David Shand to Mr Alan Stockdale on 12 May 1993, summarising the financial details of the bidders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This, in itself, raises serious questions about the extent to which the Premier and other ministers have met with principals of Hudson Conway during the bidding process, despite their public denials to the contrary. The allegations can be summarised as follows: the state government subcommittee, headed by the Premier, did receive details regarding the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7156"> various financial bids of the casino; there was regular contact between senior members of the government and the authority leading up to the announcement of the Crown group's successful securing of that bid, and there has not been sufficient confidentiality in the bidding process. These are serious allegations that are required to be put to rest. Business confidence in this country's tendering process requires nothing less.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish today to speak about a matter which I have referred to on a number of occasion previously but want to raise again because of new evidence which is available. I speak about the shredding of the Heiner inquiry documents in Queensland. I am sure, Mr Acting Deputy President, that you would be interested in this. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It is a topic I have not visited for some time, primarily out of consideration for the fact that it has been before the Privileges Committee and I certainly did not want to interfere with their deliberations. Also, I have not spoken because I have been waiting for a report to be tabled in the Queensland parliament. That report has now been tabled&mdash;or, at least, parts of it have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 5 December 1995, the Senate Committee of Privileges tabled its 63rd report, which concerned the possible false and misleading evidence before the Select Committee on Unresolved Whistleblower Cases, of which I was a member in 1995. It was alleged by witnesses, Messrs Kevin Lindeberg and Peter Coyne, that the Queensland Criminal Justice Commission gave such evidence. The Committee of Privileges came to the view that the CJC had not deliberately misled the Murphy committee by withholding importance evidence, because the CJC admitted in writing to the Committee of Privileges that it had never before&mdash;and I underline `before'&mdash;seen or accessed the material which caused Mr Lindeberg and Mr Coyne to lodge their complaint.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not going to debate the view taken by the Committee of Privileges. Obviously, it was quite proper. In any case, it is a very serious matter deliberately to mislead a Senate committee; and, obviously, that was the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> position taken by the Committee of Privileges. However, I do want to inform the Senate of what an extraordinary admission by the CJC means to the Heiner case, and to link that with the findings of the Morris&hyphen;Howard report tabled in the Queensland parliament on 10 October this year by the Queensland Premier, Mr Borbidge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me explain to honourable senators what the Morris&hyphen;Howard report is. It is a report of two independent barristers appointed by the Borbidge government in May 1996 to investigate two unresolved whistleblower cases, one of which was the Lindeberg allegations about the shredding of the Heiner inquiry documents and the payment of public moneys to the sum of $27,190 to a public servant, Mr Peter Coyne. It was he who was seeking statutory access to the Heiner documents and the original complaints in early 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Messrs Tony Morris QC and Edward Howard were commissioned to look at departmental and criminal justice material, to ascertain the legality of the shredding and the payment, and to recommend whether a commission of inquiry was necessary. I might add that they did recommend a commission of inquiry. Their report was some three months over time for various reasons, but their findings in respect of the longstanding Lindeberg allegations were quite astounding. They found that it was open to conclude that serious criminal offences had been committed over the Heiner document shredding, the disposal of the original complaints back to the union, and the shredding of copies of the original complaints&mdash;because it was indeed known that the documents were required as evidence in foreshadowed judicial proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind the Senate that the Heiner inquiry document shredding was ordered by the Goss cabinet on 5 March 1990. The current leader of the Queensland Labor Party, Mr Peter Beattie, refused the barristers access to the cabinet documents, as such access would breach cabinet confidentiality and the Westminster traditions. The barristers could neither clear nor open up potential criminal charges, because Mr Beattie refused to open the vault.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Beattie had stated on many occasions that the case has been investigated inside out <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7157"> and upside down, and he described the Morris&hyphen;Howard investigation as a political stunt. I do disagree with Mr Beattie on this occasion. Because the documents were not available, the barristers recommended a commission of inquiry to get to the truth. They indicated that it was open to conclude that serious offences involving destruction of evidence, attempting to obstruct justice, perverting the course of justice, and so on, were far more serious than the matters in the Carruthers inquiry established by the CJC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate will be interested to know that the CJC was quite sure in 1995 that, when the decision to shred was taken, the Goss cabinet knew that Mr Coyne required the documents, and that it was after he had served notice on the Crown. This was further confirmed in fresh documents to the Committee of Privileges as recently as 3 December this year. But here we are, nearly two months later, and the Borbidge government is still deciding what to do&mdash;which I must say the Democrats find quite remarkable and also inexcusable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The barristers were rightly concerned at how such serious conduct could have been contained in post&hyphen;Fitzgerald Queensland for six years. They describe the Criminal Justice Commission's investigation as being `inexhaustive', thus contradicting the statement made so many times that it had been investigated upside down and inside out. For my part, I can still hear the words of then CJC Chairman, Mr Rob O'Regan QC, ringing in my ears telling our committee in Brisbane that this case had been investigated to the nth degree, and that he had personally checked the file and found nothing in it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now find that on 16 August 1996 a senior Queensland QC, in a letter to Senator Ray on behalf of the Criminal Justice Commission, made the outstanding admission:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The documents in question have never been seen by the commission, have never been in the possession of the commission, are not now in the possession of the commission and the commission has been unaware of their existence until their existence was revealed by the contents of your letter under reply.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the letter to the Chairman of the Committee of Privileges from the CJC. Not <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> prepared to have a conversion on the road to Damascus, the QC on behalf of the CJC says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not now possible to say what course the commission might have taken had it been aware of the existence of those documents.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the CJC has made a finding of fact on the Lindeberg allegations based on, admitted, incomplete evidence and it is not going to do anything about it. What a remarkable state of affairs. The QC further stated that the CJC `has an obligation to be impartial.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same incriminating documents, which, I remind the Senate, Mr Lindeberg always said were hidden in the system, could have been obtained by the CJC. These same documents, examined by barristers Morris and Howard for the first time in six years, led them to make gravely serious charges. These documents were withheld from our committee in l995 and yet this case is supposed to have been investigated to the nth degree.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it does not stop there, and this greatly concerns the Democrats because of our commitment to open and accountable government. The Morris and Howard report found a mystery involving the Queensland Crown Solicitor concerning a final piece of legal advice he gave to the department. Today, I want to tell the Senate that this so&hyphen;called mystery can be solved. The document exists. It is one that has not been shredded. It is dated 18 May 1990, and the Democrats call on the Queensland government to immediately release it to interested parties but especially to Lindeberg and Coyne.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The significance of this last piece of crown law advice is not lost on the Australian Democrats. We are looking at the possibility of the Crown Solicitor in Queensland actively engaging in the commission of a serious offence to obstruct justice. It is advice which contradicts previous lawful advice he gave on 18 April 1990. I suggest that it is intolerable for this to remain unresolved. The people of Queensland must have confidence in the integrity of the crown law office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, let me remind the Senate that many thinking people are very concerned at how such prime facie criminal and official misconduct behaviour and injustices could <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7158"> have remained contained in Queensland's public administration for six years. I believe the CJC must explain its role, including the issue surrounding the tampering with evidence and the findings of stipendiary magistrate Noel Nunan in 1993. The police commissioner should explain his role, as must the information commissioner, the auditor&hyphen;general and others. This affair is too vast for the present Connolly and Ryan inquiry to investigate thoroughly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats have heard that the Borbidge government is reneging on its commitment to get to the truth of this sordid affair&mdash;only achievable through a commission of inquiry&mdash;because it would cost too much. Such an excuse is nonsense and contrary to the principles of responsible government in a democracy. This affair, unless addressed properly and thoroughly by the Borbidge government, may engulf it too, because the integrity of the crown and the state is at stake. These principles are no respecter of political parties or members of parliament. They say today, `The Borbidge government must stop the delay. Six years of a concerted cover-up is long enough. Six years of injustice for those plainly affected by this affair is long enough for them and their families.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that Shreddergate, as somebody has called it, is an issue that demands resolution, and I call on the Queensland government to establish the commission of inquiry which it has promised, and to do so forthwith.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, my friend Senator Forshaw interjects and asks, `Is this your state of the nation address?' No, it is not; but what it is, Senator Forshaw, is the state of the state of Tasmania address. When I go through that with you, you will see that we, as the Liberal Party, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> made significant promises to the people of Tasmania before the 2 March election and we have delivered on them in full.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we came into government we had a huge task in front of us. Most Australians now fully accept that the budget situation was not a surplus, as promised by the then Minister for Finance, the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley). In fact, it was a $10 billion deficit. The railways were moribund; the industrial relations system needed overhauling; there were a lot of areas of government endeavour that needed to be addressed. Despite all those difficulties, the federal government saw fit to deliver on the Tasmanian package. The Tasmanian package was a special package in recognition of the needs of my home state of Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Acting Deputy President, I am pleased to say that my Liberal colleagues and I were involved in the drafting of the initiatives that we took to the people of Tasmania. The promises that were made are worthy of consideration. Let us look at what we have done in relation to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first&mdash;and, I suppose, the most significant&mdash;promise was the Bass Strait passenger vehicle equalisation scheme, which we introduced as of 1 September 1996. So, within six months of being elected, we delivered on it and provided a rebate of $150, ranging up to $300 for a return trip. It is interesting to see what benefit that has been. In fact, we realise that, of the bookings over Bass Strait, 70 per cent are now emanating from the mainland. In other words, the people who are benefiting from this equalisation scheme are mainlanders visiting my home state of Tasmania. The flow&hyphen;on benefit to all those small businesses and tourist enterprises within regional Tasmania, which allows them to grow and prosper, is clear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of the increased bookings, the Tasmanian line has been required to put on eight new booking clerks. There have been substantial increases in the bookings and, for the current financial year, bookings on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Spirit of Tasmania</EMPHASIS> are up by more than 30 per cent to 166,563 passengers. That is a boost to the Tasmanian economy in anybody's terms. I am very pleased to see <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7159"> that, despite the very difficult financial circumstances in which it found itself, the government delivered on that promise in full. The people of Tasmania and, indeed, the mainland are now benefiting from that policy initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Linked very closely with the Bass Strait passenger vehicle equalisation scheme is our ongoing commitment to the Tasmanian freight equalisation scheme, which I remind honourable senators was introduced by a former Liberal government. The Labor government let it keep going, but there were no initiatives in relation to it. Then the Liberal Party gets into government again and we provide the Bass Strait passenger vehicle equalisation scheme. It has been a history of Liberal Party support for Tasmania in recognising the real disadvantage that is occasioned by Bass Strait separating Tasmania from the other parts of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the past, the Tasmanian freight equalisation scheme was funded on an annual basis. We have now committed ourselves to a five&hyphen;year funding plan. That provides certainty&mdash;and if there is anything that business needs in times of difficulty, it is certainty in relation to government policy. We have delivered that to the businesses of Tasmania to assist them in their enterprises, not only because we want to assist business, but because we are concerned about the jobs these businesses provide to Tasmanians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> There were a number of other initiatives, including the independent review of Tasmanian industry and employment. That has now been announced and I am pleased to say that the Hon. Peter Nixon will be undertaking that task. I note that it was a previous Liberal government that commissioned the Callaghan report into Tasmania's economy. It is vitally important for all Tasmanians to recall that these initiatives are building on the initiatives implemented by the previous Liberal government. It is unfortunate that Tasmania had to go through a 13&hyphen;year period of a federal Labor government which did not allow for the continuation of our initiatives and far&hyphen;sighted policies for the benefit of my home state. But I am sure Mr Nixon will do a magnificent job in assisting government, business and com munity organisations to come to grips with Tasmanian industry and employment issues, and assist us in providing better opportunities for all Tasmanians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We committed ourselves to a $7 million funding, over the next three years, of the Inveresk redevelopment project. Those funds have now been committed and they will be used to clean up the old railway site, restore heritage buildings, improve water quality and redevelop the Elphin showgrounds for a mix of residential and cultural activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a Liberal party we are also concerned about environmental issues&mdash;but, might I add, the real environmental issues; not the ones that you might get yourself onto the night TV news about because you are standing in front of a tree or a bulldozer, but those that are really important, such as water quality. I am pleased that the government has maintained its commitment to providing $7.8 million over three years to enhance the water quality and social amenity of the state's key waterways, including the Derwent, Tamar and Huon rivers, and the ongoing rehabilitation of the King and Queen rivers and Macquarie Harbour on the west coast. Given the recent discussions in this chamber on the Telstra legislation and the natural heritage bill, I look forward to the further benefits that my home state will gain from those important initiatives which are going to assist the people of Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the area of land care, as well&mdash;another important environmental area&mdash;there has been a commitment to providing funding of $2.5 million to assist the community Landcare groups. It is vitally important that we recognise the importance of landcare and water quality for our ongoing environmental security.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were grants to Tasmanian scientists from the international science and technology program, and those grants will allow Tasmanian scientists to travel overseas to work with world leaders in the areas of science, engineering and technology. A major industry in my home state of Tasmania is the forest industry, and the wood and paper industry strategy will promote growth and investment in that important industry, including greater <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7160"> downstream processing, value adding, plantation development and farm forestry. To that, we have provided an extra $1.07 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the first major initiatives that we announced was the change in the woodchip regulations. It is a matter of grave concern to me that all Labor senators from Tasmania voted against those regulations and tried to scuttle them on motions moved by Green senator, Bob Brown. We have known for a long time that members of the Labor Party were in a dilemma in determining whether they would try to support the Green constituency, or the workers in the timber industries in all the regional areas around Australia and&mdash;given my comments today&mdash;in the regional areas of Tasmania. They sat on the fence and suffered the consequences on 2 March.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since 2 March they have jumped off the fence firmly on side with the extreme Greens. As a result, they have put themselves on record&mdash;not only once, but twice&mdash;on motions moved by Senator Brown that they wish to repeal the new woodchip regulations which have provided so much hope to the forest workers and the communities that rely on the timber industry in my home state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An interesting question to consider is how the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Adams) and, indeed, how the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Quick) would have voted on this attempt to scuttle the woodchip regulations had they been in the Senate, as opposed to being in the House of Representatives. I think that we may well have seen two very embarrassed Labor members of the House of Representatives.</PARA>

<STATE> (New South Wales)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(1.40 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the sittings of this parliament draw to a close for the year, I wish to make some comments on a matter of great public interest: the issue of the republic. I have just heard Senator Abetz talking about progress reports and claiming that his government has honoured promises made. One of the promises that this government is running away from is its promise to allow the people a say in determining the important issue of whether an Australian should be our head of state. As with many other promises that were made before the election and have since been broken, one that the government certainly appears not too keen to keep is the promise <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7161"> to hold, on this important issue, a convention and an indicative plebiscite of the people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am advised that, not too many moments ago, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) delivered his state of the nation address, and that not once did he refer to the issue of whether an Australian should be our head of state. One would have thought that he would at least have given some passing mention to the issue, notwithstanding his strong and avowed monarchist views.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that, increasingly, the public in Australia believe that, as we enter the new millennium in the year 2000, an Australian should be our head of state. Just as we entered this century moving to independent nationhood, we should also be at the end of this century considering this very important issue. Just as the conventions that were held in the 1890s were about Australia becoming an independent nation with its own constitution, we should now equally be focusing upon the issue which really will deliver full independence, that we should have an Australian as our head of state. I would like to make a few observations and also deal with some of the misinformation, smokescreens, obfuscation and chicanery indulged in by the government to divert attention from the real issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said at the outset, the real issue here is whether the monarch of another country&mdash;the United Kingdom&mdash;should continue to be the head of state of Australia. I believe that we are in the rather absurd position of being one of the few countries in the world that accept a foreign head of state as our own. In the Commonwealth of Nations&mdash;which used to be called the British Commonwealth, but no longer; at least that change has been brought about&mdash;there are some 51 nations who are members of the Commonwealth. Of that number, only 21 are monarchies; the remaining 30 are republics. Of the 21 monarchies, 16 have the British monarch as their head of state&mdash;and Australia, of course, is one of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A vast majority of the members of the Commonwealth of Nations are independent countries with their own head of state, some with a monarch, such as Malaysia, but most <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of them with a president as the head of state. Nevertheless, all of those countries are full members of the Commonwealth of Nations. If we were to move to have an Australian as our head of state, we will be no less so. In fact, I believe we will be a more free and independent member of the Commonwealth of Nations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us go wider and look at the situation in the rest of the world. We will see that, outside of the Commonwealth of Nations, except for two cases, no other country in the world has a foreigner as its head of state. Which two countries outside of the Commonwealth of Nations have a foreigner as their head of state? First, there is Andorra. Andorra is in the unique situation that it has two heads of state; one being the President of France and the other being the Spanish Bishop of Urgel. I am sure all honourable senators have it stored away in their collective memory that Andorra, like Australia, has a foreigner as a head of state but, unlike Australia, it is even more bizarre and has two.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other country is, of course, the Vatican. The Vatican is in the unique position in that the head of state of the Vatican may be a citizen of another country. But upon attaining the papacy the head of state of the Vatican becomes a citizen of the Vatican. When we put aside those two examples, because of their particular peculiarity in how their head of state is appointed, we will not find a country anywhere else in the world, outside of the Commonwealth of Nations, that is like Australia and has a foreigner as the head of state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People on the government side and those who support the retention of the British monarchy as our head of state would say, `So what? Why should Australia be like the rest of the world?' This is the old, `If it ain't broke, don't fix it' argument. I would have been a bit more attracted to that sort of argument if it had been put forward for Telstra. I mean, there we have a thriving, efficient, great public enterprise that the government says we should change and sell off. When we ask: `Why should we sell it off?' We are told that that is what they are doing in Cuba, Albania and Poland&mdash;that the rest of the world is having privatised telecoms <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7162"> and that Australia should follow the lead and be like the rest of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, when it comes to the republic and the issue of having an Australian citizen as our head of state, it is different&mdash;the rest of the world is an aberration and Australia has got it right! That argument is further advanced by the proposition that, `If you become a republic, you will end up like Iraq or Iran. Our democratic system of government will fall to pieces. The country will collapse. Our traditions of fair play and freedom and democracy will all disappear. These republics are really terrible places.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, that is an absurd argument, but it is one that is put. Only a few days ago, I heard a member of the government putting forward those sorts of arguments. Maybe it was being done in jest. Nevertheless, it is this spurious line that is put out, supposedly to defend an archaic institution for Australia; namely, having the British monarch as our head of state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us recall that in 1966 we changed our currency from that which applied in the United Kingdom&mdash;the system of pounds, shillings and pence&mdash;to decimal currency. That had a far greater impact upon this country and its economy than anything emerging from changing our head of state could have, but we did it. We did it under a Liberal government. Former Prime Minister Menzies actually changed our system of currency to one which was no longer the same as that in the United Kingdom; but today they cannot bring themselves to accept that we can have an Australian as our head of state, which will not have anything like the ramifications for our way of life that those changes had.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us consider a few of these other arguments. For instance, the argument is put that Australia's great democratic history all derives from having a constitutional monarchy. Frankly, I think that is an absurd proposition. It just happens that Australia is one of the luckiest countries in the world, as we know, and has enjoyed freedom, peace and stability, by and large, for its entire period of white settlement. The Aborigines, quite rightly, would have a different view; but, in the last 200 years, we have been free from such <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> things as large&hyphen;scale civil unrest and foreign invasion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government would want to argue that that is all because we have had the Queen of England and, prior to her, the King of England as our head of state, forgetting that their accession to the throne came about as a result, initially, of the execution of the King of England&mdash;Charles I&mdash;in 1649 and the removal of a later monarch of England in 1688. So, there is an interesting history there, which no doubt on another occasion I will have a chance to go over to demonstrate that a lot of this supposedly peaceful society that we have has nothing at all to do with the English monarchy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What it does have to do with is the fact that Australia, geographically, has never had to share a border with any other country. Therefore, we have been in the unique position&mdash;compared to a lot of other places, such as Europe particularly and the Middle East&mdash;where we have not had the same tensions, whether they be racial tensions, nationalist movements or whatever, that have characterised a range of other countries. I do not believe that that peace and stability will change if we happen to change our head of state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the remaining minute or two, let me very quickly indicate why I believe we should have an Australian as head of state. The first thing is that it is an absurdity today to have a foreigner as our head of state. The question is: we are Australia, so why should we have a British citizen as our head of state? When the world focuses on our country in the year 2000, when we host the Olympics, it should be an Australian head of state who opens those Olympics, not the head of state of the United Kingdom, whether it be Queen Elizabeth, the Queen of England at the moment, or her successor, something that we have no control over. It should be somebody who will actually be in the stand barracking for Australian athletes, not somebody who was actually supporting Manchester, which was our rival when the City of Sydney was selected to host the games.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that as we enter the new millennium, the year 2000, it is time we <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7163"> finally grew up and had an Australian as our head of state. And it is about time the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) understood that, notwithstanding his personal views on this matter, this is important for the nation. He should move forthwith to allow the people to have a say, and honour those promises he gave at the last election on this very important issue.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on a matter of public interest which is also one of public importance. It is probably one of the most disgraceful situations that exists in the forest industries of this country&mdash;in Tasmania, and maybe in other states. I have a very firm view that the officers of the Tasmanian forestry commission are corrupt. I believe they may well be receiving financial payments for the actions that they have taken in colluding with certain other players in the industry in that state.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the short period of time I have available I will endeavour to prove that statement, which I do not make lightly. The circumstances in the forest industry, not only in Tasmania but maybe in other states of Australia, are so bad that they will put into the shadows the circumstances in Papua New Guinea that led to the Barnett inquiry. We have a situation in this country where we import in excess of $2 billion worth of forest products. Yet, in Tasmania, anyone who is not in the club, not already in an existing industry, cannot get a look&hyphen;in. Indeed, the forestry commission will go so far as to take legal action to stop developers who are proposing to bring about new processing facilities which are totally export orientated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe the officers are corrupt, although when I started to read a transcript of when the commission was before the House of Assembly in something like an estimates process on Thursday 5 December, I really began to wonder. Mr Bacon, who is the shadow minister for forests, asked this question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Just going back to my previous question, would it be possible for you to give us volumes of category 1 and category 2 logs that have been produced? <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Rolley, who is the chief commissioner, replied `Yes'. Mr Bacon then asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Produced, as opposed to sold?</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very important point. Mr Beswick, the minister, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What is the difference?</PARA>
<PARA>Well, what a clown he is&mdash;that just gives you an idea. The minister does not even know the difference between sawlogs that can be produced from a forest versus sawlogs that actually get sold. Of course, the chief commissioner knows and what Mr Rolley went on to say was very interesting. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Every single cat. 1 that is produced is sold; cat. 2 sawlogs, as I was saying to you before, the specifications will vary depending on the market.</PARA>
<PARA>What a load of rubbish. That is a complete and utter lie to start with, because the specifications for category 2 sawlogs are clearly set down in legislation. This bloke is a liar, he is corrupt, and if something is not done about it then I do not know what we are going to do in terms of the forestry operations in Tasmania. It will be a sad day if we can never get to a point where we can really benefit from the forest resources we have in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I raised the question about the regulations that are currently in place here as they relate to export woodchips. Senator Parer, you might be interested that your regulations do have a problem. They are deficient with regard to the requirements they place on sourcing of material for export woodchips. The licences are deficient, and even your minister does not know that. He put out a press statement making claims that he was going to investigate certain issues raised with him in the House of Representatives. As I understand it, he wrote to the shadow minister indicating that he was seeking the basis of those claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me tell you, Senator Parer, the minister was well aware of those claims. Indeed, a number of Liberal members received letters from the CFMEU's forest division with respect to that, yet there has been no response at all. And you still have the likes of Harris Daishowa refusing to take sawmill residues as a source material for export woodchips. This is a very important issue and Senators from all states ought to be aware of it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Both the minister and I are aware of the latest survey but the advice which I have received from the minister is that one should treat the figures in the survey with some scepticism. At one point, for example, it suggests that 48 per cent of Australians have some form of health insurance. The real number is in fact around 40 per cent, so there is a 20 per cent error margin on the findings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, there is strong evidence of agreement bias in the survey: 56 per cent of respondents agreed with the proposition that the Medicare levy should be paid by everyone whether or not they have health insurance; and 67 per cent agreed with the directly contradictory proposition that there should be a choice between paying the Medicare levy and private health insurance; that you should not have to pay both.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Against that sort of background, it is questionable as to how reliable or how useful the survey is in gauging public opinion. There is no use commenting on the fact that the survey claims that 72 per cent of people support the inquiry or that 51 per cent of people support changes to Medicare, given the obvious unreliability of the figures contained in the report.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Okay, this is `what about the banks'?, Senator Murphy: the Commonwealth Bank has cut its variable home rate to 8.25 per cent, the first of the major banks to do so. Thank you, Senator Murphy, for the question; it is much appreciated. Standard variable home loan rates have not been so low in almost two decades. Labor could not achieve loan rates this low in its 13 years of office. Senator Conroy, you are fairly new to this place but you may remember that, under the Labor Party, under these heroes on the front bench of the Labor Party, under Senator Faulkner, home loan interest rates peaked at 17 per cent under the Keating government. What an absolutely appalling record!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For a family with an average $100,000 mortgage, the benefit of the latest 0.5 per cent cut by the banks is worth around $40 per month and brings the total benefit to a 2.25 per cent cut since the election. That is equivalent to almost $188 per month. The reduction <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in interest rates is a reward for the Australian people. It is a reward for wage restraint and for supporting the government in its efforts to tackle the budget deficit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The benefits to families do not stop with lower interest rates. Families are getting a great Christmas present in the form of lower interest rates. They will also be receiving a magnificent New Year gift. The family tax initiative will be delivered from 1 January and is worth $1 billion per year to Australian families. For eligible families, this is worth $200 per child per year. Single income families with at least one child under five will receive a further $5,000 bonus. For example, a single income family with two children, one of which is under five, will receive a benefit in the order of $900 per month. Two million families will enjoy this benefit. If Senator McGauran wants to know what is happening to credit card interest rates and other matters, he might like to ask me a supplementary question.</PARA>

On 1 January, two million eligible families will begin receiving the coalition government's family tax payments worth a total of $1 billion. Could the minister tell the Senate how this initiative has been received and who will benefit.</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a pretty important question to an awful lot of Australians. The family tax initiative was one of the centrepieces of the coalition's election commitments to deliver a better deal for Australia's families who had been hurting so badly under the last 13 years of the Labor government. It is specifically designed to assist families with children and it recognises the cost of raising children. It recognises just how much children cost to feed, cloth and educate. It also promotes choice for two parent families in deciding whether either one or both parents will go out to work, particularly during the early years of a child's life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The benefits of the package have been recognised by many independent observers. NATSEM analysed the initiative and found that less than one&hyphen;third of all families with children will receive no benefit at all. In fact, my department's analysis is that 80 per cent of families with children will be eligible. The families who miss out are the rich who do not need this government assistance, as the Australian Family Association recognised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Family Association said that they are pleased to see that the government's family tax package impacts favourably on all but the wealthiest families. Geoffrey Lehmann, writing in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, also recognised that the package is very well targeted. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">NATSEM found that 40% of the total gains will go to families in the bottom 30% of the eligible family population.</PARA>
<PARA>The biggest beneficiaries of all, I am glad to say, will be sole parents. This was confirmed by the Brotherhood of St Laurence who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But there is no doubting the value of this payment to low&hyphen;income families. It is the largest increase since the late 1980s . . . and will lift some basic incomes by around 5% of the poverty line. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For a sole parent pensioner with one child, the extra $700 p.a. far outweighs the $2 per week increase in the Guardians Allowance granted in the last budget.</PARA>
<PARA>To ensure that all Australians are aware of the benefits they can access from the package&mdash;its start date on 1 January&mdash;a major advertising campaign is already under way. Why, then, would the ALP be mounting a scare campaign which can only confuse families and make them think that they will not be eligible? It is pretty mean&hyphen;spirited, especially close to Christmas, even for such a desperate and mean&hyphen;spirited mob as we have opposite. It was interesting reading Alan Ramsey this morning.

But what I will say is that it was a gross misrepresentation of why extra funding was being provided in this budget for the emergency relief of people in need. The government had a very clear recognition that the emergency relief funding that was provided by the previous government&mdash;and, after all, the poverty that we have inherited in Australia has been the result of 13 years of Labor rule&mdash;was not sufficient to help out those agencies which were providing the assistance. Consequently, those extra funds over four years were badly needed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, we have undertaken to review the formula on which they are based.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the reforms which we are proposing in this budget legislation, which is coming to the Senate shortly, I hope, people will not be on it for an indeterminate length; they will be on it for a finite period&mdash;six weeks for the first breach of the regulations and 13 weeks for the second or subsequent ones.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">FECCA welcomes the Government's aim of simplifying clients' access to Government services through the establishment of a one stop agency.</PARA>
<PARA>Minister, is it not true that your quotation was both selective and misleading? Is it not true that FECCA's view of your government's proposals is quite negative? Didn't FECCA also submit that they view `with considerable concern that significantly fewer job seekers will receive assistance in 1996-97' and that they have `significant concerns when the government's competitive framework is applied to market assistance'?</PARA></QUESTION>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course when you produce some excerpts from a very extensive range of consultations, which the government indicated it was going to undertake and lived up to that commitment&mdash;it consulted very broadly around Australia and received hundreds of written submissions and held a number of consultations&mdash;and if you <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> pick out one sentence, two sentences or three sentences, you are being selective. As to being misleading, no, I am not being misleading, because the truth of what FECCA said is in the sentence that I quoted. They may have said other things as well but they certainly did not say anything that made the quote I used yesterday untrue with respect to what they were commenting on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In other words, what you need to accept, Senator, is that there are people in the community who are prepared to come to a consultation and say, `I agree with this aspect' and `We give you wholehearted support on that.' They might go on and say, `There are other aspects that I have concerns about but, within that framework, the way you are heading is an appropriate way to head.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So my answer to you is yes, of course it is selective. Unless you give 100 per cent of what someone said, you are being selective. That follows, and I notice you are nodding and accepting that. Do I think it is misleading? No, I do not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nonetheless, Senator, since you raised the question of the consultations that we have had and what people have had to say, you might be interested in what Centacare Australia have had to say with respect to the labour market reforms that were announced yesterday as a consequence&mdash;the amendments to them anyway&mdash;of those consultations. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Centacare Australia, the peak social services network for the Catholic church in Australia, praised the labour market assistance reforms announced by the government yesterday. They congratulated the government on a wide-ranging consultative process. They went on to say that the shift in emphasis by the government demonstrates a new sophistication with respect to highly disadvantaged job seekers.</PARA>
<PARA>They went on further to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reforms announced today are a significant step forward.</PARA>
<PARA>If you are not interested in what Centacare had to say, perhaps you would like to listen to what the Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission had to say. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Toby O'Connor, National Director of the Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission, praised the reforms made to labour market assist <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7171"> ance by the Howard government, which were announced today&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>That is, yesterday. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Vanstone is to be congratulated for the extensive consultations she has initiated across Australia with key community representatives.</PARA>
<PARA>If you are not happy with that, perhaps you would be interested in this bit:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The commission welcomes the way the community sector views have been taken seriously by the minister.</PARA>
<PARA>Or perhaps this bit:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The extension of assistance to the most disadvantaged job seekers from 12 to 18 months, as well as a strong commitment to assist disadvantaged metropolitan and rural communities signify the government's resolve to tackle the unemployment crisis in a comprehensive manner.</PARA>
<PARA>Last, but not least:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This initiative marks a new era in the government's inclusive approach to consult with relevant peak non-government church and community sector organisations.</PARA>
<PARA>In summary, I am very happy with the response to the consultations we have had. I am pleased that we have been able to make further amendments to satisfy concerns that people raised. I fully endorse a wide consultative process and I do not expect that everyone will agree 100 per cent with everything the government is doing. To get such broad endorsement of the reforms we have made from people such as the Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission and Centacare Australia is a matter of great pride to this government, not something you were able to achieve.</PARA></ANSWER>

I refer the minister to his response to a question from Senator Sandy Macdonald on 9 September 1996 following the inaugural meeting of the APEC energy ministers, particularly to his final comment that `energy policy must take a long view and not be formulated with a short-term perspective'. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7173"> Given his stated commitment to the long view, why is it that the minister's department is investing so little in energy conservation and renewable energy research, particularly when compared with our APEC competitors such as Japan, which is investing in excess of $600 million annually in these areas through the new sunshine program? Does the minister not agree that funding in this area has a dual benefit of assisting and reducing greenhouse emissions and of promoting industry opportunities in this growth sector?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Margetts for that question. Let me say right from the outset that we would like to be spending more money on new energy type programs. Just to correct Senator Margetts with respect to the Japanese expenditure&mdash;and I think it puts it into perspective&mdash;the New Energy Development Organisation, which visited me some months ago from Japan, is spending $US3,000 million on a yearly basis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To some degree that spending is controlled by the people who contribute into that fund. My understanding is that, for every litre of petroleum that is imported into Japan, a certain amount of it goes into this fund. That is the sort of money that they have available. We do not have that money available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In regards to the sort of expenditure we are making, the ERDC, the Energy Research and Development Corporation, is spending this year in the order of $9 million. Much of it is directed to the sorts of things Senator Margetts is interested in. We are all interested in these things because there is a great potential demand for alternate forms of energy. We currently produce in this country about $250 million worth of solar energy resources, whether they be photovoltaic or solar heating operations, and $100 million of that is exported. It is a growing market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might point out that these are not the sorts of energy sources that will at this stage replace the traditional forms of energy such as coal, gas, uranium and so on. They do represent a growing market in niche areas such as remote areas where it is not economical to put in powerlines and the growing markets in the islands of the Pacific and Indonesia. During the APEC ministers' <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> conference I had some discussions with the Indonesian minister and he showed great interest in the growth of this particular market. He saw this as a growing opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know this will please you, Senator Margetts&mdash;it certainly pleases me: generally, those countries look on Australia as having the leading edge in the development of solar electricity generation. When you take the long view, I think we are going down that track.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Next week I intend to release the green paper on sustainable energy for the next 25 years. That will give people across the board the opportunity for much input before the publication of the white paper, which I expect to occur some time in the middle of next year.

Minister, were you advised that such an offer would destroy any leverage Australia may have had by making such a substantial concession only months before the likely election of a Labour government in the UK?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true that last month I went to London&mdash;as my predecessors in this job have done&mdash;to try to have the UK government honour its moral duty to index the pensions of its expatriates in Australia. The Senate should be aware of the fact that the UK government indexes its pensions in, I think, something like 35 countries around the world, including Europe, the United States and, more recently, the Philippines. It does not choose to index the pensions of its expatriates in Canada, Australia or New Zealand. Mr Beazley has been misrepresenting this situation very grievously in Western Australia. I suppose it has got something to do with the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7176"> election there. But, as I have said before, it is cruel and he should desist from being so dishonest. The Beazley name has been a proud name in Australian politics over the years&mdash;father and son. I think it was beneath him to do that to elderly people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point is that I have not made any proposal to top up the pensions of existing British pensioners in Australia provided the government takes on responsibility for the new ones. The agreement requires me to acknowledge&mdash;and I cheerfully do&mdash;the responsibility of Australia to continue to top up the pensions of those British pensioners that we already top up. However, over many years and successive ministers and successive governments, the British have refused a number of proposals which would make for fairer treatment of their own people in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I went to Britain with a new proposal which was fair by anybody's standards. It was very fair to the British taxpayer and very fair to all the British pensioners in Australia. It would have meant that, in the future, at a date to be fixed by agreement between the parties, all future British pensioners in Australia would have their pensions indexed. Nothing is fairer than that. The proposal was developed on advice from my department. It was taken after representations only about a month before by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer). I went to see the British minister, accompanied by the Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, the former Minister for Social Security, Dr Neal Blewett. We went to visit the opposition spokesman, Harriet Harman, and we also spent a working lunch with the House of Commons select committee. The committee is investigating this matter right now, and is very concerned about the issue. Across party lines, members said that they were embarrassed by the British position. In fact, I pointed out that I thought it was immoral.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

As the program with China was first proposed by Victoria, the lead role in developing an agreement remained with that state.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I understand that the Minister for Community Services in Victoria was nominated by the health and community services ministers to sign the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> agreement on behalf of all Australian states and territories. Once an agreement is finalised, the lead state or territory maintains responsibility for policy and legal issues but all states and territories are responsible for individual cases.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am advised that the reasons for the delays in finalising the agreement between Australia and China mainly relate to the recognition of Chinese adoptions in Australia and the Chinese government's concerns about the children's status on arrival in Australia. In 1995 China proposed that this could be resolved by the lodging of a US$5,000 bond with notary public offices in China which they propose would be returned to the applicants when the adoption was finalised. This requirement remains an outstanding issue for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am also advised that there may have been a change in the agency in China responsible for negotiating adoption agreements, which may have slowed the negotiating process.</PARA>

While the review serves as a useful basis for discussion of the personnel issues facing the ADF and we agree with its 10 stated principles, it was written under a different industrial relations culture.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We feel there is much to be gained in efficiency, flexibility and quality of service to unemployed people from the reform process.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Deputy President, is that true? Answer: no, it is not true. The truth of the matter is that the South Australian Unemployed Groups in Action said this&mdash;and this is the full paragraph of their covering letter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although we remain opposed to the overall reductions in expenditure on labour market assistance and the policy of tying benefits closely to job search activity, we feel there is much to be gained in efficiency, flexibility and quality of service from the reform process.</PARA>
<PARA>How could a competent minister not read the whole of that sentence in that covering letter from the South Australian Unemployed Groups in Action?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there is the FECCA submission to the minister. Senator Vanstone said, `Senator Bolkus may be interested in this.' Unfortunately for Senator Vanstone, Senator Bolkus was interested&mdash;so interested that he got the whole of the submission and read it. Quoting Senator Vanstone from yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">FECCA, Senator Bolkus may be interested in this, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">FECCA welcomes the Government's aim of simplifying clients' access to Government services through the establishment of a one stop agency.</PARA>
<PARA>Then, what does FECCA go on to say? In the same paragraph FECCA says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, given that the number of one stop agencies will be significantly fewer than the current <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> combined number of CES and DSS offices, and the fact that those assessed as being eligible for additional assistance will have to then move to an employment placement enterprise, FECCA questions the likelihood of the government realising its objectives. In addition, whilst the notion of offering choice of provider to those assessed as eligible for additional assistance may have some merit, this must be balanced by the likely confusion and uncertainty engendered by such a process for many unemployed people, especially those of non-English speaking backgrounds.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the full story; that is the complete paragraph. They are the words that Senator Vanstone selectively quoted from.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we go on to the ACROD submission on reforming employment assistance. Senator Vanstone quoted a half&hyphen;sentence from that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ACROD members welcome the objective of the reforms that labour market assistance will become client driven rather than process driven . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Then we have a very substantive submission of 14 pages basically debunking what Senator Vanstone has said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue is this: is it good enough for a minister to come into this Senate chamber and selectively quote from documents in that way? Is it proper, is it acceptable for a minister to not only mislead the Senate but to mislead the public?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say, as I indicated in question time, this is just another example of the Wright family syndrome. This is the Wright family syndrome again from Senator Vanstone. This is the sequel to the Wright family saga from Senator Vanstone. What she has been doing is deceiving the Australian public and the parliament, barefacedly telling untruths in this place, misleading the parliament. It has become, of course, a way of ministerial life for Senator Vanstone. It is Senator Vanstone's modus operandi in this chamber. That is the way she does business. And again today, she has been exposed comprehensively by the opposition for it.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She alerted me to the FECCA submission. I went off and read it. What did I find in the one paragraph that Senator Vanstone quoted from? I found that the second sentence ran totally contrary to the impression Senator Vanstone tried to give here yesterday. She came in here trying to give us the impression of support from FECCA. She came in here <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> quoting selectively, and the effect was to mislead this place. Let us read that paragraph. The sentence that Senator Vanstone read out stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">FECCA welcomes the Government's aim of simplifying clients' access to Government services through the establishment of a one stop agency.</PARA>
<PARA>The next sentence states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, given that the number of one stop agencies will be significantly fewer than the current combined number of CES and DSS offices and the fact that those assessed as being eligible for additional assistance will then have to move to an employment placement enterprise, FECCA questions the likelihood of the government realising its objectives.</PARA>
<PARA>On it goes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whilst the notion of offering choice of provider to those assessed as eligible for additional assistance may have some merit, this must be balanced with the likely confusion and uncertainty engendered by such a process for many unemployed, especially those from a non-English speaking background.</PARA>
<PARA>She was selective and she was misleading in her selectivity. In doing so, she misled us not only as to the context of that sentence but also as to the whole FECCA submission with respect to this particular area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She comes in here today not content with having been misleading with respect to a selective excising of one part of a paragraph. She says that what we should do is take it that she is giving us a sentence and, in producing a sentence from a submission, she is giving the full flavour of the submission. She did not do that in respect of FECCA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I tell you what: she did not even do it in respect of the South Australian Unemployed Groups in Action. Senator Vanstone, in quoting them yesterday, selectively excised the relevant part of the same sentence. Senator Vanstone did not excise the rest of the submission when she came in here yesterday. She quoted some part of a sentence and did not quote the rest. With respect to the Unemployed Groups in Action of South Australia, she said that they felt that there was much to be gained in efficiency, flexibility and quality of service from the reform process. What she did not say was that, in that very same sentence, they also said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7187">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although we remain opposed to the overall reductions in expenditure on labour market assistance and the policy of tying benefits closely to job search activity . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Also, she did not say that the submission from that group, like the FECCA submission, is riddled with concerns about what this government and she, as minister, are doing with respect to most of the important elements of the programs that she is pushing forward. So she cannot even tell the truth when it comes to repeating one sentence of a submission, let alone getting the whole submission right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it goes on. We did go out and check other organisations as well. For instance, the submission from the National Council on Intellectual Disability is also riddled with concerns&mdash;concerns, for instance, as to the capacity&hyphen;to&hyphen;benefit aspect of what the minister is doing. As Senator Faulkner said, the ACROD submission is some 14 pages. Senator Vanstone could not go to that submission; she could not invoke it as support and do it honestly because that submission is riddled item by item with concerns about what this government is doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When it comes to misleading the Senate, this minister is a recidivist. She has done it again. She should not be allowed to do it. In doing so, she has basically undermined once again the Prime Minister's code of ministerial conduct. It is a code that has had a fair battering this year and, of course, a battering from this minister. She is not up to the job, if she has not read the submissions. If she has read them, there is absolutely no way she could have come into this parliament yesterday and claimed that what she said was an honest reflection of what those submissions are saying about her policies and programs.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, wish the Senate to take note of the misleading statements made by the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone). Before I turn to them, though, I am bound to respond to the extraordinary remarks we have just heard in this chamber from Senator Abetz. I know that Senator Abetz in his previous <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> existence was a lawyer. All one can say is that he is the ready-made and advocated&hyphen;at&hyphen;all&hyphen;opportunities person to call when you do not have a speaker to make a case, no matter how fallacious.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Abetz was presenting a classical fallacy. It is a fallacy which in Latin is defined as an ad hominem fallacy. That is to say, `You are crook, therefore we cannot be criticised.' That is what he said. I do not for one minute accept any of the arguments that have been put by Senator Abetz about the three Labor members who he named. However, he believes that they are crooks. He says this is disgusting behaviour, therefore we have no right to criticise the disgusting behaviour on their side. Where are the parliamentary standards in that type of behaviour?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If it is bad, it is bad. Whoever has been responsible for making it bad is justifiably criticised. On this occasion, the criticism is justifiably at the door of Senator Vanstone. It is quite extraordinary what she did in question time. Let us walk ourselves for a minute through what she did. She said, `Yes, I selectively quoted but, of course, I cannot spend all of my time quoting everything these organisations said.' But when you look at what she selectively quoted, you would expect to see that it would represent in microcosm what the organisation said in their whole submission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But does it? No, it does not. She selects&mdash;very selectively&mdash;one part of, in one case, a 14-page submission, the very one part that says something complementary about the government, and she reproduces that as if that is the representative view of the organisation, when quite clearly it is not. By being selective in that way, she seeks to deceive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If she had said, `They said these things but, on the other hand, they said that,' we would get a view of what that organisation believed. Take the example of FECCA, which concerns the question I asked of her. I have here the submission of FECCA. It runs for 10&half; pages. On the one-stop agency, Senator Vanstone said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">FECCA welcomes the Government's aim of simplifying clients' access to Government services through the establishment of a one stop agency. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7189"> </PARA>
<PARA>Did FECCA say that? Yes, they did. Is that representative of their view? No, it is not. The next sentence says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, given the number of one stop agencies will be significantly fewer than the current combined number of CES and DSS offices and the fact that those assessed as being eligible for additional assistance will have to then move to an employment placement enterprise, FECCA questions the likelihood of the Government realising its objectives. In addition, whilst the notion of offering choice of the provider to those assessed as eligible for additional assistance may have some merit, this must be balanced by the likely confusion and uncertainty engendered by such a process for many unemployed, especially those of non-English speaking background.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>Is that a ringing endorsement of what the government is doing? Of course it is not a ringing endorsement of the measures introduced here by Senator Vanstone, and to select the one sentence and ignore the myriad of other sentences which are condemnatory of the government and pretend that that one sentence represents the view of the organisation is to deceive, is a fabrication and is to mislead. Senator Vanstone says, `Well, I can't represent the lot, so I chose one.' She then went on to a lot of other organisations that she chose to quote from. We have had examples given here this afternoon. The example that was most outrageous was the South Australian Unemployed Groups in Action. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we feel there is much to be gained in efficiency, flexibility and quality of service from the reform process.</PARA>
<PARA>That is part of a sentence. The full sentence goes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although we remain opposed to the overall reductions in expenditure on labour market assistance and the policy of tying benefits closely to jobsearch activities, we feel . . .</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the President, to a question without notice asked by Senator Tambling today, relating to the administration of the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee's inquiry into the provisions of the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996.</PARA>
<PARA>I was very pleased to receive the assurance of the President that the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, which is inquiring into voluntary euthanasia, will be properly and adequately resourced for the task that it has been asked to undertake on behalf of this Senate. This is a most important issue and the fact that we now have an extraordinary number of submissions to the committee&mdash;well over 7,000 on Monday of this week and likely to exceed 10,000 submissions by the time that they close&mdash;does demand that the Senate and our staffers give this matter proper and full consideration when addressing the issues that are at stake.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Naturally, the issues, as they relate to Senator Bob Collins from the Northern Territory, and to Senator Lundy and Senator Reid from the Australian Capital Territory, are those that very carefully go to the terms of reference of the committee. They look at the constitutional implication for the territories of the enactment of the legislation, the impact of the enactment on the provisions of the Northern Territory criminal code and the impact on and the attitudes of the Aboriginal community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am well aware that a number of submissions will be coming forward that address all of those issues. I have personally written to over 900 constituents in the Northern Territory who I know share concern about the issues that Senator Collins and I take very seriously in the Northern Territory. The debate in the House of Representatives this week, and in the last number of weeks, certainly has excited a lot of emotion in the Northern Territory. Today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Northern Territory News</EMPHASIS> talks about how, in the House of Representatives, the speakers on voluntary euthanasia rubbished the Northern Territory. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7190"> The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Northern Territory News</EMPHASIS> editorial went on to describe that debate as being one of vitriol and pomposity. They also made the point that the parliament was quite happy to throw democracy and fairness to the winds and overturn that law&mdash;that being the Northern Territory law. The editorial further said that the anti&hyphen;voluntary euthanasia campaigners have `fought dirty and won'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to draw to the attention of the Senate three speeches that I have made here previously. The first of those speeches was on 21 June 1995, when I tabled the Northern Territory legislation, various select committee reports in the Northern Territory and other documentation. Following that speech and that legislation, there was no action in this federal parliament to disallow, under the provisions that were available under the Northern Territory (Self&hyphen;Government) Act, that Northern Territory legislation. It was only subsequently and opportunistically raised in the House of Representatives by Mr Andrews at a much later date, after the six months provision had expired.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 16 October this year, I addressed the matter of the evolving issues related to statehood for the Northern Territory and very much drew attention to the provisions that are in the draft constitution that has been prepared, and is currently circulating, with regard to statehood for the Northern Territory. As a result of the initiatives, it is going to be a pity, if it gets passed in the Senate at some stage next year, that the Northern Territory parliament will again have to revisit the issue subsequent to statehood.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 28 October this year, I addressed the issue of the remonstrance which was presented to this parliament by the parliament of the Northern Territory and which was supported and backed up by the parliaments of the Australian Capital Territory and Norfolk Island. Those three constituencies have very important issues at stake that do need to be properly addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do need to be able to ensure that the Senate is now doing the job that the House of Representatives should have done in sending the matter to a committee for a full and proper debate, and that committee will now <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> proceed. I am pleased that the committee is going to meet on 24 January in Darwin to hear submissions in that particular area. Senator Collins and I have agreed to co&hyphen;host a public forum in Darwin the evening before that. I am very pleased that Senator Collins will be able to facilitate that particular exercise to enable territorians to put on the record the passion that they feel about this issue where the federal parliament may override the territories.

Since the beginning of this exercise, there has been an enormous amount of publicity, with some leading lights in it. No more leading a light has there been than Dr Philip Nitschke. I disagree with almost everything that Philip Nitschke has ever said or done in his public life in the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Philip Nitschke's first foray into the public domain was over the hospital's lack of equipment for a nuclear disaster in Darwin Harbour. His second was methadone treatment for heroin addicts and so on. It was almost impossible at one period in the Northern Territory to turn on a radio or television set <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7191"> without seeing Dr Philip Nitschke. Philip Nitschke is now professionally managed by Harry M. Miller on this question of euthanasia. I said nothing about that, much as it turned my stomach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today's story in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> is appalling, if it is true. The story says that Dr Philip Nitschke is currently negotiating with the Powerhouse Museum in Sydney for them to have his killer computer, his death machine. It will not be a replacement for it, but the actual machine. Dr Nitschke is quoted as saying that there is no money involved. The museum is negotiating with him for him&mdash;that is, Dr Nitschke&mdash;to have a replacement machine. By necessary implication, that means that the museum will be getting the actual piece of medical equipment that killed that patient in the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Will it be a ghouls gallery at the Powerhouse Museum? Philip Nitschke has gone one step too far on this issue. What is being proposed is ghoulish. I call on Philip Nitschke to cease and desist. It is just appalling that a medical practitioner would even contemplate handing over a piece of his medical equipment, particularly this one. It is Dr Death and his killer computer. That is fair enough, I suppose, if that is what he wants to do. But he is having it mounted as a museum exhibit. I might agree to it if Dr Philip Nitschke agreed to be mounted beside it. Leaving that aside, it is a ghoulish proposition. I call on Philip Nitschke or Harry M.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Today, as the parliamentary year draws to a close, we reflect on the months since March in the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7193"> knowledge that we have been true to our word. We do so, not under any delusion that the job is over, but in the knowledge that the job has successfully begun.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We promised to stay in touch with the great Australian mainstream. And we have been true to our word.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We promised honest, competent and accountable government. And we have been true to our word.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We promised to restore the fundamentals of a sound, growing and competitive economy. And we have been true to our word.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We promised more choice for Australians in how they live and work&mdash;more choice for families, more choice in industrial relations, more choice in education, more choice in child care, more choice in telecommunications. And we have been true to our word on all of them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We promised greater freedom, more incentives for achievement, more competition and less regulation. And we have been true to our word</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We promised that where change is necessary, the reasons for it would be communicated clearly to the Australian community and its burdens would be shared fairly by different sections of the community. And we have been true to our word.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We promised no new taxes or increased taxes, the retention of Medicare, the maintenance of the safety net for the disadvantaged and a better deal for rural and regional Australia&mdash;and we have been true to our word on all of them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And in the wake of the tragic events at Port Arthur in April my government, in co&hyphen;operation with state governments and with the full support of the Labor Party and the Democrats, delivered strong national gun laws prohibiting automatic and semi-automatic weapons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This action alone has made a lasting contribution to a safer and more peaceful Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both symbolically and in substance it struck a defiant blow against a culture of violence which too readily permeates our community and which has wreaked such terrible consequences in other nations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nine months into our first term, we are still a young government. But we are already a government of clear and consistent values.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our achievements are being built on a fundamental conviction : that the decentralised networks of families, workplaces and communities of free individuals are far more effective generators of choice, freedom and opportunity than the suffocating centralism of political grand plans and bureaucratic controls.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That conviction will remain our enduring guide. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In looking to the future, we know that we have established a secure first base camp as we climb a high mountain. We know that we must continue to go forward, and that we must do so together.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a nation, we face the economic challenges of achieving high sustainable economic and employment growth at a time when the great driving forces of change and opportunity will be globalisation, technological change and the communications revolution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a society, we also confront the tensions and strains imposed by family breakdowns, violence, homelessness, economic hardship and youth alienation in our community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In these circumstances, our agenda for the next year is clear.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will consolidate the gains we have made in establishing sound economic management, in advancing the interests of families, in boosting small business, and in building a new framework for higher productivity, more investment and more jobs in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But we will also move on to meeting new challenges, both economic and social:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">to tackling our national savings problems;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">to building a more world&hyphen;competitive economic infrastructure in Australia;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">to enhancing the protection of our environment;</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">to re&hyphen;building the social capital of our community through a strategic but limited role for government and through encouraging the talents and potential of every Australian.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Labor Party has been left on the sideline&mdash;marginalised, factionalised, hopelessly out of touch and irrelevant to the re&hyphen;invigoration of Australian policy&hyphen;making that is now taking place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Labor is left fighting yesterday's battles and refusing to learn the lessons of its electoral defeat.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is left noisily insisting that its priorities in government were right, and that they remain right. They still cannot understand why an ungrateful Australian mainstream abandoned them so comprehensively.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Labor is left practising the last resort of failed political leadership&mdash;trying to scare people by misleading and deceiving them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They will not succeed because Australia has moved on.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is worthwhile recalling just how far we have come in the 10 months since the people decided to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7194"> place their trust in a new coalition Government on 2 March this year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The compelling need for fiscal repair has been pursued without compromising our main election commitments. We did not create the $8 billion Bankcard bill but we have accepted the responsibility to fix it.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">GETTING THE FUNDAMENTALS OF THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY RIGHT</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The economy we inherited from Labor was loaded with large debts, heavy deficits and high levels of unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our economic strategy is rightly focused on establishing the economic fundamentals for sustained economic and employment growth, action to reduce unemployment over time and a steady improvement in living standards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have set Australia on a new course of proper fiscal responsibility built on increased national saving, the maintenance of low inflation, reduced pressure on interest rates and restoring the underlying budget balance to surplus.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The major building blocks for this are now in place. They include the recently passed Workplace Relations Legislation, the 1996&hyphen;97 Budget and new monetary policy arrangements with the Reserve Bank.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our policies are already starting to work.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our inflation rate compares favourably with that in other industrial countries. Underlying inflation is now comfortably within the Reserve Bank's target range. And forecasters predict that inflation will remain moderate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of lower inflation, and the reduction in the budget deficit, interest rates have fallen. The Reserve Bank has reduced the official cash rate three times since March&mdash;the latest this morning.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Families and businesses have benefited substantially. Families with a $100,000 mortgage are saving around $145 a month in interest payments as a result of the fall in variable home loan interest rates by 1&frac34; percentage points. If today's rate cut is passed on in full there will be a further saving of $40 a month. Cash flows are under less pressure, and that means business can now undertake the investment needed for faster growth, higher productivity and more jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our first budget aimed to transform the underlying budget balance from a deficit of $10.3 billion in 1995&hyphen;96 to one of $1.5 billion in 1997&hyphen;98 and a surplus in 1998&hyphen;99&mdash;a massive turnaround of $8.8 billion or 1.8% of GDP in just two years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is being achieved with no increase in income tax rates, no increase in the company tax rate, no increase in the wholesale sales tax rates and no increase in the petrol excise. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are also legislating a Charter of Budget Honesty to ensure that the Australian community is kept fully informed of the true state of the economy and the budget, particularly at election time. This ushers in a new era where deceit, such as that attempted by Labor at the last election as to the true state of the national accounts, will be a thing of the past.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Approval by parliament of the government's landmark Workplace Relations Legislation heralds a new industrial relations era for Australia which will boost productivity enabling higher take home pay and lay the foundations over time for greater job creation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The previous government's anti&hyphen;job, unfair dismissal laws have gone. They have been replaced with a simpler more balanced system that provides for a fair go all round.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Employees and employers are now able to reach mutually beneficial agreements about productivity, wages and conditions that best suit their particular workplace. This will be achieved within an appropriate framework of guaranteed minimum conditions, and without the uninvited intervention of third parties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our support for a safety net increase of $24&hyphen;a&hyphen;week phased in over three years reflects a commitment to genuine protection for the low paid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Compulsory unionism has been abolished. It's gone. It has been replaced by the fundamental principle of freedom of association. Stronger sanctions have been introduced against unlawful industrial action, including union secondary boycotts, which have been outlawed through the reintroduction of sections 45 D and E of the Trade Practices Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have also concluded an historic agreement with the Victorian Government which will give all Victorian workers and employers the opportunity to operate within the one industrial relations system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The old industrial relations system was holding back growth and holding back our country. This government can proudly say that it has given Australia an industrial relations system for the 21st Century.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have acted to remove the impediments to growth caused by unnecessary regulation. We have, in co&hyphen;operation with the states, created clear, fair and efficient procedures for approving new resource projects. We have ended effectively the use of export controls on minerals except for uranium, terminated the three mines policy and entered into co&hyphen;operative arrangements for environmental assessments for new projects with the states. All these measures will especially assist the development of resource projects. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7195"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a strong demonstration of my government's commitment to ongoing investment in major projects of all kinds I announce today that I will be appointing to my office a Major Projects Facilitator. The role of that person will be to ensure that speedy approvals are given to major investment proposals which conform with government policy. This person will have business experience as well as a full understanding of the workings of government. We believe that at all times the climate for investment in Australia should be a welcoming one and not one where unreasonable obstacles are thrown up at every turn.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian financial system is in need of review. The inquiry into the financial system, which we have established under the chairmanship of Mr Stan Wallis, will identify the forces of change and the scope for improvement in the regulation of Australia's financial sector. It will provide the foundations for a more efficient and competitive sector while maintaining essential stability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will enhance Australia's attractiveness as an international financial centre, improve both the quality and cost of services to customers of financial institutions, and increase the potential of competition to keep downward pressure on interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Labor's high interest rates sent many small businesses to the wall&mdash;and this government will do everything possible to maintain the downward pressure on rates so that enterprise and jobs are not stifled by the cost of capital.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consistent with its election commitment, the government is accelerating the pace of micro&hyphen;economic reform. Today the government is announcing major reforms in the petroleum products industry which will increase competition, put downward pressure on petrol prices and benefit consumers.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">PROVIDING JOBS AND OPPORTUNITY BY GETTING GOVERNMENT OFF THE BACK OF SMALL BUSINESS</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Small business is part of the heart and soul of all members of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Small businesses are the engine room of the Australian economy. They provide a livelihood for millions of Australian families. They are the single greatest source of jobs and opportunities in our economy. They are the backbone of local communities and neighbourhoods, as well as towns throughout regional and rural Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Getting government off the backs of small businesses has been one of our highest priorities since taking office.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are determined to promote the small business sector as a dynamic and expanding generator of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> jobs, national wealth, economic opportunity and community responsibility. We are re&hyphen;invigorating it through a range of tax, labour market and de&hyphen;regulatory reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the tax front, one of our first actions was to reduce the provisional tax uplift factor, freeing up cash flows for small businesses and valuable capital for investment in expansion and jobs. In the budget we implemented our promises to provide rollover relief from capital gains tax to allow small businesses to grow. We also provided an exemption for up to half a million dollars on capital gains on the sale of a small business where the proceeds are used for retirement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After listening to small business people, we recently made the scheme even better so that the capital gains tax relief applies not just to those rolling over into "like businesses".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As well, we are determined to cut the red tape, the regulation and the paperwork that bedevil so many hard&hyphen;working small business operators and deter so many potential new ones.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have already made a start&mdash;the Australian Bureau of Statistics is reducing the burden of statistical collections on small business by 20 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I received the report of the Small Business Deregulation Task Force on 1 November 1996. It is an important and welcome document, containing 62 recommendations for changes in tax arrangements, measures to reduce business compliance costs and to improve the efficiency of regulation and information provision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government will respond to the report by February 1997 and I can assure you that the response will be a positive one.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">ENHANCING CHOICE AND SECURITY FOR FAMILIES</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This government is proud to say that it has Australian families at the centre of national decision&hyphen;making&mdash;whether it be economic policy, social policy service delivery, industrial relations or any other area of government activity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our more responsible economic management has delivered practical relief for families in terms of recent reductions in home loan interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But we also took direct action in the budget. Overall we have cut the tax burden on families by around $1 billion. From the first day of the new year, almost two million low and middle income Australian families will benefit from our Family Tax Initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For a one&hyphen;income family earning up to $68,000 a year with two children, one of whom is under five, this will deliver an extra $34 a fortnight. Of course, that includes sole parent families. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7196"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When it comes to families, we have delivered</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will make private health insurance more attractive to low and middle income families. From 1 July 1997, families with dependent children will be entitled to receive an incentive of up to $450 per year, paid either as an up&hyphen;front reduction in their premiums or as a tax rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government also recognises that for many families choice means access to quality, affordable child care appropriate to their needs. Our child care strategy will ensure the continuation of a flexible and responsive child care sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other measures including the Retirement Savings Accounts, superannuation improvements, such as the low income spouse rebate, lower interest rates and lower inflation will all ease pressures on families and provide them with more choice about how they live their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We also believe that the special work of carers deserve more recognition and in line with our commitments, we have provided significant additional funding for the National Respite for Carers Programme to augment existing respite funding and establish Carer Resource Centres throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Eligibility requirements for the Carer Payment will be liberalised, enabling carers to work longer hours in non&hyphen;caring roles and to take an average of one day a week off from caring.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We know that various pressures produce family breakdown and we want to prevent this wherever possible. We have increased funding for marriage and relationship education, and to enable community organisations to help people become better parents.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">GIVING HOPE TO YOUNG AUSTRALIANS</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Young people of Australia are our future leaders. We need to nurture them and invest in them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are addressing the root cause of youth unemployment by establishing the preconditions for real job growth through improved economic management and our regulatory and industrial reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are implementing a number of strategies directly targeted at young people which particularly address the development of skills through education and training, for example, in literacy and numeracy, and through school&hyphen;based vocational training.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our training and industrial relations reforms will encourage the expansion of traineeship and apprenticeship opportunities. The government has allocated over 200 million dollars over the next four years towards implementing the Modern Apprenticeship and Training Scheme, MAATS. The scheme will bring Commonwealth expenditure in this area to over 1.7 billion dollars over the next four years. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Integral to our approach to other young people who need help, is the development of strong social institutions&mdash;the family, the community, and schools. Early intervention, family support and community involvement are critical to the success of our programmes to deal with youth suicide and homelessness.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Youth Homelessness Pilot Programme which I initiated, for example, involves community groups working with homeless young people to facilitate family reconciliation and to improve their level of engagement in work, education, training and the community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And the National Youth Suicide Strategy which will receive an additional $18 million over three years is a real attempt by all governments to address a serious social problem in our community.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">ENSURING INVOLVEMENT AND SECURITY FOR OLDER AUSTRALIANS</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has a special commitment to the security and well&hyphen;being of older Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The value of their pensions is guaranteed through the indexing of pensions on a twice yearly basis in accordance with the Consumer Price Index and by maintaining their value at a minimum of 25 per cent of Average Weekly Earnings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are encouraging people to make greater provision for their retirement during their working lives. For instance, the exemption from Capital Gains Tax where a small business is sold to provide for retirement. People will also be able to continue contributing to superannuation up to age 70 and the lower provisional tax uplift factor will assist many older Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Discrimination in the tax system against self&hyphen;funded retirees has also ended. The tax rebate applying to pensioners is being extended to low income retirees of pension age.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have been particularly concerned to protect the economic future of people not readily covered by existing superannuation arrangements. Retirement Savings Accounts and the new superannuation spouse rebate will improve the opportunities for the accumulation of benefits by non&hyphen;working or low income spouses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We recognise that many older Australians need care. The budget included a package designed to restructure residential aged care to arrest the decline in the standards of nursing homes around the nation. This package will also better meet the special care needs of older people, particularly those suffering from dementia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our private health insurance incentives have also been welcomed by older Australians and I hope that in the years ahead we can do more in other ways to ensure our senior citizens have a comfortable and secure retirement. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7197"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">REVITALISING REGIONAL AUSTRALIA</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We said we would revitalise Australia's regions and provide the basis for renewed confidence in the future. We are on track to meeting this commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A strong small business sector and new investment will provide jobs in regional areas and our actions are aimed at encouraging both.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some areas of rural and regional Australia are still recovering from the worst drought on record. The government has increased the support to farm families until normal cash flows return, so they can get on with rebuilding their properties and help restore the vitality of their region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We announced in October an additional $81.5 million package for areas recovering from exceptional drought.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has also introduced legislation to establish the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia. The Trust will provide more than $1.2 billion for a comprehensive programme of action to address key environmental problems facing Australia. Funding for the Trust is to be sourced from the proceeds of the sale of one third of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Cleaning up waterways and improving landcare are both crucial to future generations of Australians in country areas and the coalition is proud that in its first year, it has, with the help of Senators Harradine and Colston, moved to implement this historic environmental reform.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Advanced telecommunications infrastructure is critical for the social and economic health of rural and regional Australia. The government has moved to ensure the availability of enhanced services such as call waiting, call diversion and high speed access to the Internet through the early completion of the digitisation programme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are establishing a $250 million Regional Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund to ensure that Australians living in regional and rural areas are not left behind by advances in telecommunications technologies. The application of such technologies outside our capital cities has virtually unlimited potential to reduce the geographical isolation of regional and rural communities and enhance their business competitiveness and educational opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Transport costs often represent a significant economic hurdle for regional Australia and the government remains committed to lowering this burden. We will spend $750 million upgrading the Pacific Highway and $149 million on Black Spots. Our reforms to rail will also provide a more efficient and competitive rail system, thus further reducing the barriers to investing in regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government is particularly pleased about the establishment in September of a high powered joint <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> industry and government Supermarket to Asia Council. This brings together government, business, labour, science and marketing expertise to remove bottlenecks which prevent us exporting our quality food products to Asia to our full potential. Those bottlenecks are costing country people their jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are addressing specific challenges in sectors critical to rural Australia, such as the workability of the Native Title Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have given forest industries certainty through the granting of transitional licences for three years to underpin future investment and employment. We are working to ensure long term resource security while protecting high conservation value forests under the Regional Forests Agreements Process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Major resource project approvals are being handled expeditiously without duplication with the states, while providing certainty for industry and ensuring sound environmental outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have approved the $500 million Korea Zinc Australia Pty Ltd operation at Townsville. Complementary Commonwealth&hyphen;State environmental assessment for the Jabiluka No 2 proposal and the $1.25 billion expansion proposal for Olympic Dam arrangements have been announced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Rural Finance Summit Activating Committee has presented its first report to the government, identifying high priority areas for action flowing from the Rural Finance Summit held in July. These will be assessed by the government for implementation. The Committee will report to government early in 1997 on a Business Plan for Rural Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">IMPROVING OUR EXPORT PERFORMANCE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's trading performance is a vital element of the government's strategy to improve job opportunities and living standards for all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government therefore is putting particular effort into reducing barriers to Australia's exports&mdash;both tariffs and other obstacles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A recently concluded agreement with Taiwan will improve our access to markets for beef, citrus and other fruit and cars. As a result, Mitsubishi Australia has already concluded a $35 million deal to export its new Magnas to Taiwan and announced extra jobs at its Adelaide plant. We are exporting fresh milk to Hong Kong for the first time as a result of recent negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This year's APEC leaders' meeting successfully maintained the momentum for regional trade liberalisation. Australia has already opened up its own economy, decreasing average tariffs to 5 per cent. We are looking for other economies to match us, and this year's APEC individual action plans are a good start. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7198"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These action plans clearly show that the momentum for regional trade liberalisation is there and delivering concrete benefits for Australian business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Restrictions on some agricultural imports are being reduced in Hong Kong and Japan. New access for Australian business in banking and investment will be available in China, Thailand, Singapore and the Philippines. The Philippines will lift import restrictions on coal and Thailand will liberalise the natural gas market.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the World Trade Organisation the government is working hard to ensure that market access commitments made in the Uruguay Round are adhered to. The government also wants to ensure momentum is maintained for further progress beyond Uruguay Round outcomes in all areas of concern to Australian business. In particular, we want the ground to be laid for negotiations on agricultural access to proceed expeditiously from 1999.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DEVELOPING THE GREAT POTENTIAL OF AUSTRALIA'S REGIONAL RELATIONSHIPS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's success and prosperity is tightly bound to the future of the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region. The government is deeply committed to strengthening Australia's economic and strategic relationships with the other major economies and powers in our region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since coming to office, ministers have moved quickly to establish productive contacts with their Asia&hyphen;Pacific counterparts. Within weeks of forming government, I held a successful meeting with the Prime Minister of Malaysia. My first bilateral overseas visit was to two of our most important regional partners&mdash;Japan and Indonesia. Discussions with the Japanese Prime Minister, Mr Hashimoto, and President Soeharto made clear their interest in co&hyphen;operating closely with Australia under my government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the APEC leaders' meeting in Manila I met Chinese President, Mr Jiang Zemin, and underlined the importance the new government placed on its relationship with China. My visit to China next year will be a good opportunity to build the relationship further.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was delighted to welcome to Australia President Clinton, only the third such visit to Australia by a US President. The clear message from both sides during the visit was the enduring strength of the bilateral relationship and a common commitment to our region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The visit built on the Australia&hyphen;United States ministerial talks in July at which agreement was reached on a number of measures to strengthen the Australia&hyphen;US alliance, and the contribution it makes to regional stability. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government played an important role in concluding the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and will continue to work hard for non&hyphen;proliferation objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have moved quickly to address deficiencies in the combat of our defence force.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Defence was quarantined from budget cuts in the government's deficit reduction efforts. The administrative savings of $125 million a year were redirected to improve combat capabilities, training and personnel retention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A COHESIVE AUSTRALIAN SOCIETY</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is a united tolerant and harmonious nation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The goal of my government is to focus on those things which unite Australians and not those which might divide them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our success in absorbing millions of people from the four corners of the globe in a climate of tolerance and positive espousal of common national goals has been an example to the rest of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite our success we must all strive to build on our past legacy of tolerance and egalitarianism.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My government is steadfast in its commitment to the process of reconciliation between indigenous Australians and the wider Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We want higher living standards and greater economic independence for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. We will work with states and Territories and with ATSIC to achieve practical outcomes designed to overcome the undoubted social and economic disadvantages of our indigenous people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have demonstrated an enduring commitment to the role of the arts in Australian life.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This has included a particular focus on accessibility through innovative programmes such as the Major Festivals Fund to assist Australian productions performed in capital cities and major regional areas. We are also providing support through the Regional Arts Fund, the Emerging Artists Fund and the touring programmes of the Department of Communications and the Arts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Funding for the One Stop Shop and National Cultural Network will enable greater access to information on arts and national cultural collections, including industry support programmes offered by government departments and agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of our commitment to a safer Australia, the government has committed $13 million to the National Campaign on Violence and Crime. This campaign is aimed at more effective co&hyphen;ordination and implementation of crime prevention efforts across the country and at the reduction of crime and fear of crime. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7199"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are committed to dealing more effectively with the issue of domestic violence. We anticipate specific strategies to be endorsed at the National Domestic Violence Summit to be held in 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We remain strongly committed to public involvement in the debate and decision making process about our Head of state and we will announce the next step in that process early next year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 2001, the centenary of Federation provides an opportunity to celebrate Australia's achievements and our immense democratic inheritance.

The Council will co&hyphen;operate with the states, local government and community organisations to develop a co&hyphen;ordinated programme across the country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our National Flag is a focus for national pride. As promised, the government introduced on 26 June 1996 the Flags Amendment Bill 1996 to ensure that the Flag cannot be changed in any way without a national vote of the people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A very positive example of this government's commitment to our national institutions is the enhanced opportunity now provided to ask questions in this place. Whereas in the last year of the Keating government an average of only 12.7 questions were asked each question time, the average so far this year is 19 questions. That is the highest average in the last twenty years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important that the next generation understands our society and appreciates our heritage. We have reaffirmed the commitment to civics and citizenship education and refocussed the programme to emphasise understanding of our history, the operations of Australia's system of government and institutions and the principles that support Australian democracy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CONCLUSION</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are a whole host of other achievements across a range of portfolios and we have only just begun.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) says that he is being true to his word. He said that so many times during his speech. The truth is that he is being true to some of his words and that we are supposed to forget about the rest of them. He has not been true to his word in honouring his election promises. He has not been true to that word by $12 billion. His word in the election campaign was that, given the hard choice between honouring his election promises and reducing the deficit, he would choose to honour his election promises to the Australian people. It is not being true to your word to come back after winning an election say, `PS. I meant core election promises.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australians need to look very carefully at the difference between what John Howard says and what John Howard does. What John Howard says is, `I honour my promises. I govern for all of us and I stand for higher standards.' That is what he says. But what John Howard does knowingly&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What Mr Howard does knowingly, deliberately and often divisively is exactly the opposite. Despite this, we all know that he will achieve his aim of dominating the headlines tomorrow. I am sure it is entirely coincidental that it is the lead&hyphen;up to the Western Australian election. There are positives in the first nine months of Mr Howard's government. His tough stand on gun control following the tragedy at Port Arthur, assisted by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Fischer), was a sign that he can, when he chooses, flex real leadership muscle on important national issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government also demonstrated a welcome capacity to be flexible on industrial relations reform and the end result of that flexibility was a package of reforms which is fair to Australian workers. This government has provided some overdue relief for small business, but what was left out of the Prime Minister's progress report is a lot more interesting than what was included in it. The Prime Minister talked about putting Australian families at the centre of government policy through tax relief. There is more than one way to force people to pay higher taxes. What the Prime Minister did not remind us of in his progress report was that Australian families will be paying much more for a range of services which they use every day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here is an example that did not find its way into the Prime Minister's speech. The management committee of the Katoomba Children's Cottage met this week and worked out that the lowest fee increase they can make to cover the government's cuts to their operating grants is $25 per week per child. There goes the family tax payment for those families. The Prime Minister did not tell families that they are going to pay more for medicines and health care. He did not talk about his government's decision to cut support payments for families with a disabled child. He did not talk about the funding cuts to public schools where 70 per cent of Australian children still go. He did not talk about the funding cuts to public hospitals and cuts to free dental services. He did not talk about the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> massive tax hike and breach of promise involved in university fee increases. He did not talk about that little hike of $10 a week for a first year teacher or nurse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, this government's claims to economic credibility are built on the shifting sands of $12.7 billion worth of broken election promises, the impacts of which have not yet been felt. The explanation this government offers for the callous choices it has made is, `We had no choice and, look, we did explain why we had to do it,'&mdash;after the event, of course. The Democrats still believe that this budget has cut too far and too quickly, and that, in the end, it will do more damage than good for the economy. Why do you think we are seeing repeated cuts in interest rates? I do not begrudge people the benefits of those cuts&mdash;when the banks actually pass them on, which is not what the Assistant Treasurer talked about today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are seeing those repeated cuts in interest rates not as a reward for good economic management but because the economy has been killed stone dead. The economy is not comfortable and relaxed. It is poleaxed and comatose. That is why I say Australians need to look very carefully at the difference between what Prime Minister Howard says and what Prime Minister Howard does. He likes to talk a lot about choice. Everything is wrapped up in the rhetoric of choice. His government has made choices about who is paying the price of its decision to reduce the deficit over a shorter rather than a longer time frame. It is Prime Minister Howard who has made these choices and many of them are callous and cruel choices which cannot, by any stretch of the imagination, be described as being for all of us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not about increasing choices for all of us over the last nine months of coalition government. The record very clearly shows that, in fact, it is about increasing choice for some of us at the expense of the rest of us. Where is the increase in choice in cutting $400 million in benefits to the most disadvantaged Australians&mdash;indigenous Australians&mdash;while, on the same day, announcing that the mining industry would get to keep its $800 million a year subsidy for diesel fuel? Of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7201"> course, there is no pandering to special interest groups! This is the Liberal Party&mdash;the Liberal Party does not have any special interest groups!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where is the increase in choice in cutting payments to families with a disabled child, while finding $35 million to encourage income splitting on superannuation by high income households? That is really sharing the burden, Liberal style!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where is the choice in making it harder for unemployed people to get unemployment benefits, in reducing rent assistance for disabled people living in group houses, or in forcing people over 55 to draw on their superannuation rather than get income support if they are sacked from their jobs at that time in their lives when it is very difficult to find further employment? That is not great choice. That is really pandering to special interest groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at another area: the environment. This government asserts that it cares for the environment, riding on the back of its Natural Heritage Trust Fund. Let us make one thing clear about being true to your word here. When the Natural Heritage Trust Fund money is added up, it represents a cut in spending on the environment&mdash;another case of reality not matching the rhetoric. When we look at the government's other so&hyphen;called environmental credentials&mdash;things the Prime Minister conveniently left out of his progress report today&mdash;the Prime Minister forgot to remind us about the massive increase in woodchipping. He forgot to remind us about the plan to mine in national parks and, of course, about the world's worst greenhouse policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most of all, this Prime Minister's government of the past nine months has not been true to its word on governing for all of us because this government has singled out, in the most divisive and calculated way, the more vulnerable&mdash;Aboriginal Australians, Asian migrants. It has singled out unions. It has singled out some undefined elite who have been living off special treatment for the last 13 years. This government, and its Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman), constantly refer to people on benefits <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in this country as bludging off the backs of taxpayers. That is a wonderful statement of unity and harmony, isn't it? This is the policy of deliberate division. This is nasty and divisive, but what makes it worse is that it is totally calculated and poll driven. This is what I think fails the Prime Minister's basic test of leadership, the basic test of being true to his word. He has failed the test of bringing honesty, trust and integrity to government by being no different from every other Prime Minister who has said, `I will honour my promises,' and then fails to do so to the tune of $12.7 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the great fraud that is going to be exposed in the years to come. The short-term results we know will be positive. The headlines will be there, but the damage, the division and the financial impact will be felt in the next two years of this government.</PARA>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">Development of infrastructure on Townsville Field Training Area, Townsville. (Committee's 5th Report of 1996)</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, the first report which I have tabled concerns proposed facilities at RAAF Base Townsville for 5 Aviation Regiment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed works examined by the Committee encompass two major elements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first is the construction of an advanced wash facility and environmental shelters equipped with dehumidification equipment for Black Hawk and Chinook helicopters. This will reduce corrosion caused by operation and open storage of the helicopters in salt&hyphen;laden atmospheric conditions. The shelters will also reduce exposure of the helicopters to high temperatures and ultra&hyphen;violet radiation and will alleviate occupational health and safety problems associated with personnel working on the helicopters in the tropical sun.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second is the relocation of 5 Aviation Regiment's transport and vehicle workshop facilities within the existing regimental precinct to enhance operational efficiency. Ancillary works involving the refurbishment of a helicopter arming area are also included. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The estimated out&hyphen;turn cost of the proposed works is $21.332 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has recommended that the project should proceed as planned.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report concludes that Black Hawk helicopters operated by 5 Aviation Regiment at RAAF Base Townsville have experienced unexpectedly high rates of corrosion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This has been attributed to the use of high strength, lightweight alloys in helicopter structures and the operation and storage of aircraft in humid and salt laden atmospheric conditions. Prolonged exposure to ultra&hyphen;violet radiation has affected internal electronic components and plastic fittings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In response to questions from Members, the Department of Defence advised the Committee that development of the proposed work commenced 12 months before the tragic Black Hawk accident and that it is not linked in any way to the crash.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RAAF Base Townsville remains the preferred location of 5 Aviation Regiment due to the proximity of 3 Brigade and impracticalities and considerable investment associated with alternative locations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">High corrosion rates have diminished the capacity to operate the helicopters through to Life of Type, planned for 2015 as well as affecting aircraft serviceability and requiring expenditure on maintenance, with associated costs expected to exceed sustainable funding levels.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department of Defence has implemented a Corrosion Control Program for the helicopters to permit 5 Aviation Regiment's Black Hawk helicopters to operate effectively through to Life of Type.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To satisfy the requirements of the Corrosion Control Program, there is a need to provide environmental protection shelters serviced by dehumidification equipment and an enclosed helicopter washing facility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Based on the number of Black Hawk and Chinook helicopters operated by 5 Aviation Regiment and current maintenance programs, there is a requirement for 19 Black Hawk and four Chinook shelters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department of Defence estimates that cost of environmental protection shelters would be recovered after two years, based on the $1.5 million cost of corrosion control undertaken in 1995 on four helicopters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With regard to the need for improved arrangements for vehicles and workshops, the Committee has concluded that existing transport and some technical workshop facilities are located at inappropriately remote sites, from 5 Aviation Regiment's precinct at RAAF Base Townsville.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The facilities are inadequate and their locations present an ongoing cost to unit efficiency. There is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7203"> also a need to relocate 5 Aviation Regiment's  Small Arms Repair Section and to refurbish the gunship helicopter arming point.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report concludes that the proposed environmental protection shelters, the provision of dehumidification equipment and the helicopter wash facility can be justified as providing the necessary facilities for the successful and economic implementation of the Corrosion Control Plan.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The scope of works for the transport compound and workshop facilities can be justified on the basis of considerably improved working conditions, improved shelter and security for the extensive fleet of vehicles and resulting improved efficiency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The extent of proposed ancillary work will improve the small arms repair section and ordnance loading aprons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second report which I have tabled concerns the proposed development of infrastructure on Townsville Field Training Area, Townsville.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By way of background, the proposal will enable the Army and the RAAF to effectively utilise a large training area encompassing more than 230,000 hectares and to ease environmental pressures on the High Range Training Area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Broadly, the proposal will provide:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The estimated out&hyphen;turn cost of the proposed work is the estimated out&hyphen;turn cost of the proposed work was $18.694 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of the Committee's inquiry, Members were able to fly over this extensive tract of land in two Black Hawk helicopters to inspect the extent of the training area and the sites for various components of the proposed work.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has recommended that the work should proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report concludes that a need exists to provide the necessary infrastructure to enable elements of the Australian Defence Force to undertake collective and joint training in live fire and manoeuvre, at Brigade level, in the Townsville Field Training Area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of development options examined, the preferred option will allow the Range to be developed close to its maximum potential and provide training <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> benefits within a realistic time&hyphen;frame and at realistic costs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The extent of the proposed development can be justified on the grounds of public safety, effective management and maximum use of the Range, in accordance with the user requirement and concepts for manoeuvre operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report supports the use of Army Engineers on elements of the project which would provide training benefits and not directly compete with the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Design standards will conform with relevant codes, statutes and operational manuals and procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed development was the subject of extensive environmental impact assessments demonstrating a commitment to responsible stewardship of the Townsville Field Training area by the Department of Defence.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a question that was raised initially by Senator Schacht and by others. It talks about this issue of damages. The opposition has moved an amendment that the figure of $25,000 be substituted for the figure of $3,000. I think it was said, at the close of the debate prior to the luncheon break, that this was in addition to other civil actions that might be available&mdash;such as actions in tort or in contract.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As distinct from that, this is a consumer protection provision. It seems a very clumsy way of giving the consumer protection, because if the periods that are talked about in clause 87E are not complied with then the consumer may want to do something about it. This purports to enable the consumer to do that. As it presently stands, the amount of damages is left at $3,000. It is not clear whether there are costs in addition to that. I would have thought if an action were pursued the costs might take up a lot of the $3,000 or <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> even $5,000 that would be awarded. So there has to be some clarification about the issue of costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The general thrust of my objection to it is that this is a very clumsy way of providing consumer protection. An action has to be taken in a common law court. There are almost&mdash;and I use this word advisedly&mdash;inevitable delays in bringing the action on. There is the worry of costs. As Senator Schacht said, the provider of the services will be much more endowed with resources than will the consumer. There are no provisions, as far as I can see, in the bill to make legal aid available to the consumer. I would like that clarified.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA>This amendment does two things: firstly, it expands the definition of untimed local calls to explicitly include data and fax transmission; and, secondly, it guarantees access to untimed local calls as an option for businesses in addition to welfare and charitable organisations for whom this is already guaranteed in the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently, only the provision of untimed voice calls is legislated for. But, if Telstra is permitted to remove the option of having to provide untimed local calls for fax and data, this will certainly make the enterprise more profitable.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is important to note that the intention of this amendment is not to prevent Telstra from offering the option of timed local calls, voice or data, for customers&mdash;some customers may find this option more attractive. However, if the option of untimed local calls is removed or not extended to businesses or to include fax and data transmission, this would raise telecommunication costs for many small businesses quite dramatically.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The bill does extend the right to untimed local voice calls to business and it also <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> extends the right to untimed non-voice or data calls to residential and charity consumers. This amendment takes that proposal further and says that business customers should have access to untimed local data calls or non-voice calls.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are really talking about, therefore, is a very significant subsidy for the big end of town. If anyone can afford the cost of phone calls and at least in some respect cost-based calls, then it ought to be business. Yet the Democrats are proposing to give business a very cheap opportunity to make what can be often very long calls.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To the extent that there are problems in this area now&mdash;and most commentators predict that there will be very significant problems in the future&mdash;it is because business does transfer huge quantities of data, often over a period of many hours. The Democrat amendment says that that is fine and that it can do all that for the price of a local call. That is moving completely away from any concept of cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The practical effect would be that the carrier has to subsidise it and recoup the cost out of its other charges. You continue to have close to the highest local call charges in the world at the moment because of the Telstra's cost structures. If you are going to burden Telstra's cost structures by not allowing it to charge business on a timed basis for data calls, then you are effectively going to put up the price of other services, including local call charges for residential consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the practical effect of this could well be that you simply encourage business to make more and more very long calls at rock&hyphen;bottom prices, clog up the system and as a result make it difficult for elderly people to make emergency service calls because the network has not been upgraded sufficiently to provide them with the quality of service that we would all want to see.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The more you squeeze the carrier, the more difficult it is to ultimately provide those services. So I cannot for the life of me see why you would be wanting to see the big end of town get a huge subsidy which will effectively be borne by all users of the system, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7208"> including residential consumers. We, therefore, very much oppose this amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have gone further than the current regime in extending the right to untimed local voice calls to businesses. They do not have that right at the moment, but we have given it to them. We have also made what we think is a very far-sighted decision to allow residential customers to have access to data calls&mdash;the internet, broadband services and the like&mdash;on an untimed basis. That is very deliberately to encourage people at home, particularly children, not only to be computer literate but to make the best use of these resources not just for entertainment purposes but for education purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a completely different concept from saying that we need to encourage business. You certainly do not. Business is more than happy to bear the cost of the service. They simply pass it on to their customers, as we know. Why would you want to give them one of the biggest free kicks in history? It does not make sense. I would have thought we have gone a fair way down the track in terms of ensuring that people have access to the system. What you are going to do is effectively restrict quality of service and access, because the system is being clogged up by large-scale, high volume users.</PARA></SPEECH>

That is what we are talking about here. Otherwise you are putting in place a right to an untimed local call even if, the day after they can distinguish, they would not be allowed to do it on a timed basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senator SCHACHT</EMPHASIS> (South Australia) (4.23 p.m.) I have to say that we in the opposition are not unsympathetic to the view about data information. In the long run, the concept is that someone pays 25c and has an open line for running data in the local loop until hell freezes over. I understand that. If everyone does that, there will not be enough cables hanging in every street in Australia to provide the capacity and the switching equipment. But I have to say I am a little suspicious of our good friends at Telstra. They want it both ways. They want us to give them the legislation in this bill, which is about the sale of Telstra, without telling us how they are going to determine the difference technically. This argument has been around for a fair while.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My view is that, as you have quite rightly pointed out, some of these things would be better dealt with in the deregulatory telecommunications bill post&hyphen;July. Your item here would be better dealt with in that bill next year. In the meantime, Telstra should turn up when we have the committee hearing. They can tell us technically whether they are able to identify. For ever and a day they have told <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7210"> you, me and everybody else that they cannot identify yet, but they want us to put an amendment in. And then&mdash;lo and behold! Hallelujah!&mdash;Telstra will say, `Oh, we've got the device to do it.' I would like to know about the device first and how they would separate. If they can separate out the data transmission in the local loop for various customers generally, they therefore will be able to distinguish which customers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to give a free kick to the big end of town&mdash;BHP, Coles Myer and so on&mdash;so that they are able to rort the local loop on data transmission. I am not picking on Coles or Woolworths, but Coles has got shops in the whole metropolitan area of Adelaide. They could take one 25c line for ever and a day to transmit data backwards and forwards between 15 supermarket stores. I understand that. If they can identify the customer, I want them to tell us if it is possible to separate out the big end of town. Senator Allison and you mentioned quite colourfully the big end of town, as have I. Do we want to give a free kick to the big end of town? When there is data at the small business level or even amongst domestic consumers, if they can tell us that they can identify, maybe we can segment the data issue for the use of different customers. We are saying that anyone who transmits data is going to pay a timed local call, and yet Telstra will not and cannot tell us yet&mdash;this has been going on for years&mdash;how they are going to do it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If they can do it and if they can explain it to us in the next two or three months, I will be more willing to say I am sympathetic to the view of the opposition about data transmission. But I have to say that, with my experience with Telstra, great glorious organisation that it is&mdash;your 600 pound gorilla&mdash;I am a bit suspicious about what they are asking us to do. They are asking us to buy a pig in a poke without our knowing what the technology is for them to identify it. Up until now they have always argued that they cannot identify. Until they tell us how they will do it, I suggest to you that we would be better off if you refer this amendment to the post&hyphen;deregulatory bill. We can deal with it properly there. </PARA>

I think this is a good example of something which is not necessary at this time. It could rightly be sorted out later. Privacy implications, for instance, is one of the issues which will arise with the whole question of distinguishing data and voice.

<PARA>This amendment achieves a number of ends. Firstly, it removes all the exemptions granted to telecommunications carriers from state and territory laws. These are currently granted under section 116 of the Telecommunications Act. Secondly, it abolishes the requirement to abide by the telecommunications national code. This is currently provided by sections 117 to 119 of the Telecommunications Act. The purpose of these two elements of the amendment is to force carriers to abide by state and territory planning and environment laws, instead of the code which places patently inadequate requirements on carriers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, and finally, the amendment eliminates section 120 of the telecommunications act, which section prevents state and territory laws discriminating against carriers. Eliminating this clause will avoid the possibility of carriers, for example, arguing that they should be permitted to string cables overhead in areas where powerlines are already overhead, or from arguing that they should not be forced underground until other utilities are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This clause or form of argument has not been used yet in the current debates concerning aerial cabling. But, should the immunities of carriers from state and territory laws be affected, either now or following 1 July, it is likely that the carriers will turn to this clause as a way of enabling them to continue their roll&hyphen;out unimpeded. For this reason, we believe that this clause needs to be deleted if residents are to be adequately protected.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If ever there was a set of rules of the game that had financial consequences, it was the 1991 legislation. It is breathtaking beyond belief to think that Senator Allison can simply get to her feet, talk for 60 seconds and pretend that this is just another amendment. This would be a major breach of faith that would not only devastate the investment plans of the carriers but also send all the wrong signals to international investors about the reliability of this country as a place to make major infrastructure commitments. We will certainly be tightening up the existing regime before 30 June.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I understand it, Senator Margetts, in her amendment, simply wants to have both the code and the state and territory planning laws apply as from now. Once again, that would be an even greater breach of faith in many respects. It has the fundamental deficiency of simply ripping up the rule book prematurely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> So this proposal, without putting too fine a point on it, is utterly irresponsible. We could not possibly wear it. The carriers were awarded licences and paid very good sums of money for it. We are not in the business of simply improving their bottom lines. We are in the business of seeing them enhance the clever country by providing interactive broadband services and competition in local teleph ony and cable television. We would like to see it in as many places as possible. Indeed, I think one of Senator Harradine's concerns is that it is not likely to happen in Tasmania in the short term. What Senators Allison and Margetts would have is to basically stop it happening anywhere in Australia, or certainly make it utterly unprofitable for the carriers to maintain their business plans. So we would all be the losers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I simply refer again very briefly to that so-called legal advice which she claimed indicated that the Commonwealth would not be liable if we were to go down this track. The fact is that, even on the advice itself, it raised the very real prospect of the carriers not only taking legal action but also embroiling the Commonwealth in the most protracted and costly litigation that one could imagine. The author of the advice&mdash;if you can dignify it with that term&mdash;says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whether a carrier would be successful with such a claim&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>in promissory estoppel&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">would involve a very detailed legal analysis beyond the time and resources of this Law Group.</PARA>
<PARA>There would not be too many lawyers who would not be prepared to embark on it because it was too hard. They then go on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Suffice to say that it&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the promissory estoppel&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">would be one option to be considered by a carrier and I could readily understand the carrier looking at this legal doctrine.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the author is conceding that the carriers would have a good basis for suing the Commonwealth on that course of action. They continue:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All I can say is that it would be a very involved and lengthy litigation.</PARA>
<PARA>I would not be paying too much for advice that said that to me&mdash;`I can't tell you what your chances are. All I know is that it would be very involved and lengthy.' They are basically telling you that you are going to be taken to the cleaners simply by virtue of the enormous costs and complexity. If I recall that advice correctly, it ended up saying that the Commonwealth would be better to roll over and make an ex gratia payment, which <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7215"> again demonstrates the absolute nonsense of the proposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot understand how Senator Allison can sit there and laugh about these things as though somehow there is not a validity to these criticisms. I have not heard her respond, other than to simply ignore it. The fact is that to have the Commonwealth inevitably exposed to multimillion dollar claims&mdash;and I would have thought billion dollar claims&mdash;by the carriers would not only bring the whole system into disrepute but also fundamentally jeopardise the roll&hyphen;out. We could not for a moment support it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I do want to ask is whether or not it constitutes a breach of faith&mdash;as the minister keeps reminding us that such a removal of exemption would&mdash;according to the new draft national code, for the government now to use grey cables instead of black, for cables to be underground and at major intersections, for cables to be at least 3.5 metres above the ground or higher, if possible, and to insist that there is co-location of tower facilities wherever feasible et cetera.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the one hand, the minister argues that there is a terrible problem with breach of faith and with the legal situation; on the other hand, the government is appearing to be going some way in that direction in this new draft national code.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer is simply that the 1991 act, which conferred those powers and immunities, at the same time provided for the bringing into <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> effect of a telecommunications national code. In other words, it allowed for tightening at the margin, if you like, in environmental terms. But in no shape or form was that designed to inhibit, let alone stop, the roll&hyphen;out or to suddenly throw people at the mercy of those who had specifically been given an exemption.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The clear intention of the act was to say that you do not have to comply with state and territory planning and environment laws, but there can be a code that will impose certain obligations which will have to be consistent with the overall framework. Clearly, you have the capacity to upgrade the code and tighten it to a certain extent. But you have to make sure that you do not go so far in tightening it that you actually cut across it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are arguing that we have gone so far in tightening the code that we are effectively overriding the immunity that they currently have under the act, then I am very fascinated to hear that statement. I would have thought that you would be saying that our code tightening has not gone far enough. But, if you say it has gone too far, or to the point where we are actually cutting across their immunities, then that is about the only way you could justify your argument.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are some very important <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7216"> principles involved here. The first question is whether the private industry bottom line now directs to parliament. I would think that, if that is the case, it is a fairly astounding shift and an improper way to go about decision making.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Right at the beginning of the Telstra inquiry, I asked Treasury whether or not industry would be expecting to continue to be exempt from state and federal laws on environment and planning, and Treasury said no. They were saying the market was not expecting to continue this exemption. So, Minister, if there has been an expectation, it has not been created by us; it somehow has been created by your government, I would suggest. If there is an expectation, it has been created by you, not by anybody else. There must be an ability for the Senate process to make these decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The interesting thing is that this exemption was originally related to Telecom as a wholly owned government service provider. At that stage, Telecom had responsibilities to other levels of government, and we all assumed it had responsibilities to the general community as well. These responsibilities now have a very narrow commercial focus on a definition of efficiency and effectiveness. So the whole ball game has changed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To suggest that somehow or other the Senate should be treated like a local council&mdash;which ends up getting threatened by industry any time they try to impose some sort of regulation, like being sued&mdash;is an extraordinary turn of events. It is something that we should resist very strongly. We should not be dictated to by industry bottom line, because there are real costs to the community&mdash;not just in respect of the roll&hyphen;out of Telstra and Optus now, but in respect of the future and what we as yet are not even aware of concerning other levels of telecommunications and other data roll&hyphen;outs. If their bottom line does not fit with the community's concerns about the environment, amenity and so on, we may have no control over it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is appropriate that these exemptions finish. They were for a government entity.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As to the amendments moved by the Democrats, and amended by the Greens, by Senator Margetts, the opposition will not support the abolition or repeal of the immunities in the present act. If we repeal the way it is outlined and nothing goes in, we will find that into the vacuum will step not only local government but also&mdash;I am more worried about this&mdash;state governments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Victoria, for example, it is speculated that the new privatised electricity companies, which already have their poles up, once the immunity is removed will want to become telecommunications carriers. I can see them convincing the state government of Victoria, in the void, to give them exactly the same immunity over planning of telecommunications as the federal power now gives. The only thing I have ever learned about politics is that, whatever difficulty we have at the national level, you should never give a state government an even break on these things, because they will abuse it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, as a national parliament, we cannot step away from the immunities issue and hand it back holus&hyphen;bolus to state or local government. If we did that, within a year or so we would regret it greatly. The opposition's view is that you do need to have a national obligation to ensure an adequate roll&hyphen;out of a telecommunication system that reaches all Australians. I do not want to see six different state rules operating on telecommunications that absolutely ignore the national interest, nor the 800 local government organisations having an absolute right. Therefore, outraged though I feel&mdash;as do the Democrats, the Greens and others from both sides of parliament&mdash;at the way that the carriers, in particular Optus, have arrogantly acted over the last 18 months in their consultation with local communities, I do not think trying to make amendments here today in this bill will be successful or achieve the outcome that we all want.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the telecommunications bill comes up for review by the legislative committee, I will certainly be encouraging local government <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7217"> organisations, who have done a lot of work already, to put forward their suggested amendments. The opposition will be putting forward amendments for discussion at that legislative committee level of the kind of structure that we should have on the immunities issue in the bill post&hyphen;July next year. I do not believe this should go back to the planning powers of local or state government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even if it is complicated and even if it means a greater effort of resources, I believe that this parliament should maintain a direction and control over the obligations on carriers. I do not think we can step away from it and just say, `Over to you, state government; over to you, local government; do whatever you like.' It will not overcome the problem of overhead cables, which are creating so much outrage around Australia. It will mean that there will be a patchwork: some areas will have cables, some will have no cables and other areas of Australia will not get access to broadband services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the Senate should use the opportunity through the Senate committee and the negotiation of the new draft bill in March of next year to get a good outcome. That will mean an interventionist approach against the carriers. I am sick of the carriers whingeing and whining that we are all being unfair to them. I am sick and tired of hearing carriers saying, `People will get used to the cables hanging past their door; people will get used to it once the wonders of the new service are available to them.' I just do not think that is going to occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are in trouble with this immunities issue because of the abuse and arrogance of the carriers over the last two years. As Senator Alston says, it is true that this is a bill that the previous government brought in, in 1991&hyphen;92, that extended the immunities from the old Telecom, PMG's department, to the new licensed carriers. I was part of the drafting of that legislation. At that time, the people who are now Optus said that they would absolutely never be in the local loop with any sort of cabling. Everybody accepted that advice, including the government. We were wrong&mdash;I have to say it. All sides of parliament accepted the technical advice back in 1991&hyphen;92.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, if it had been in any way suggested that the second and third carriers&mdash;particularly the second carrier&mdash;would roll out black cable down the suburbs of Australia, there would have been a different amendment. I do not think there is any doubt about that. But everybody said, `No, no. There will be no second carrier in the local loop with cable. We've got to get an interconnect fee to give them a chance to interconnect to the existing underground cable system that Telstra has.' Telstra then argued that we were making the interconnect fee too advantageous to Optus. That was the argument. They said, `It is unfair; they will never come into the local loop; you are giving them an advantageous interconnect fee.' But we said, `No. We want a good second carrier to come in, to provide the competition to get better benefits for the customer.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Optus have used the immunities and have gone about it in a very arrogant way. Telstra has therefore responded and, after 1 July next year, when other carriers can come in, in an open deregulated market, unless we use the immunity power to change the rules about cabling, it will be used to abuse the views of the local communities around Australia. On this issue, I think there is a common view amongst the representatives here in parliament, whether they are Liberal, Labor, Democrat or Green. In that bill, we have to put into place procedures that get rid of overhead cables over a reasonable period of time. We have to put it on the carriers that they have to do it in conjunction with local government and appropriate electricity authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will not happen overnight but we ought to start going down that path and put it in our own legislation. That is what this opposition through this committee process next year will be arguing. I believe that the carriers in this case have abused the immunity that we gave them. There can be no argument about that. If you had asked the people of Australia back in 1991, 1992 or 1993 whether they would favour competition coming in if it meant getting a black cable down the street, I think I know what the answer would have been.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ordinary Australians now say, `What is going on? We have got two cables coming <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7218"> down the street competing with each other. We don't have two water pipes coming down the street; we don't have two electricity cables coming down the street; we don't have two gas pipes coming down the street. But for telecommunications, we are going to have two cables&mdash;we could have three or four.' Ordinary Australians just think it is ridiculous in commonsense terms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the carriers have let loose against themselves a whole series of questions which, with some careful planning and cooperation, they could have avoided. But the arrogant personalities running the two major carriers could never agree. We have seen it in Adelaide over the last couple of months. They both will not agree to step back and share a common duct when, clearly, local government is willing to participate in that process with them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Reluctantly, the opposition will not support the removal of these immunities at this stage. We believe that we would go from the frying pan into the fire if we did. We say to the minister that we want to be very serious, in cooperation with the government and other parties, in March next year in writing a new process right through this. We will not give it back totally to local government but maintain that we provide the leadership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Allison's other amendment is about the towers not being within 300 metres of certain places. It is amendment No. 12 on the running sheet. The opposition will support this amendment. If the present carriers do not watch out, they will find that the community will, in the end, put the foot right on their throat in this matter. It is all very well to say that they have been given immunity, but people are suddenly finding that they have not had any proper consultation. Carriers&mdash;even Telstra is now getting into it&mdash;are dictatorially saying, `You're going to cop a tower at the bottom of the school yard, the local university yard and the kindergarten' without having any proper consultation. Unfortunately, people who have a view about technology development&mdash;anyone with a slight apprehension about it&mdash;are now running scare campaigns about electromagnetic radiation from these towers. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is really becoming a very difficult situation. Because the carriers have done this arrogantly, they have encouraged speculation in the community that there is something nasty going on with electromagnetic radiation from these towers. When the Telstra inquiry was in Adelaide, the deputy principal of the Mitcham Girls High School said, `We want to stop the tower being put up at the bottom of the school yard. We have a petition from hundreds of local residents.' We have had petitions put by kindergartens and child-care centres saying that they do not want any risk of having a tower. What do the good old carriers say? They say, `Bad luck. We have the immunity. We will build it, and you will get it whether you like it or not.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The carriers have brought upon themselves an enormous backlash, which is getting stronger. Unless they take account of it and start sharing towers and putting them in areas that create less concern in the community, they will end up forcing outcomes at a parliamentary level. This issue operates across the board. This is not concern by Labor, the Democrats, the Liberals or the Greens; this operates across the board, and all backbenchers are getting letters, protests and community opposition. But the carriers blithely go on saying, `We'll do it until 1 July. When the immunity goes, we will have enough up for it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not a response that we would like to take on this issue. However, we need to look at the way that the carriers have gone on about placing these towers and how they have blithely said, `Bad luck. We will put it in your school yard.' They have done this in my suburb of Magill at the Magill campus of the University of South Australia. They have just announced that they will put the tower up in the corner of that campus. Of course, a local residents group is already campaigning against it. The university is not too happy about it. That is another consistent example.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition thinks the 300 metre zone is not unreasonable only in that these carriers have not accepted that there is great outrage in the community. They say, `Why do people keep buying mobile telephones? We have to keep putting these towers up to meet the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7219"> demand for mobile telephones.' Most of us in this place have at least one mobile telephone in our office. We use these phones regularly. I understand all that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the carriers have abused the immunities. This has unfortunately let loose a backlash in the community, which is now challenging the technology. Some snake oil merchants on the fringes of the science community are in some cases running around with really extraordinary claims. This amendment about a 300 metre zone, which is amendment No. 12, will assuage some of the unnecessary fears if it is carried. Generally, though, we support the minister's view about a reduction in the removal of the overall immunities. However, we will not be supporting Democrat amendment No. 19 or the revised one from the Greens. That does not mean that we will not be back here in March having a very detailed discussion with the government in committee. Even what they have already done is probably, in my view, not enough.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst it is good to hear that the ALP have admitted this was a terrible mistake, it is also disappointing that they will not attempt to fix it. I return to the question of fixing it. I still <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have not had an answer from the minister about legal advice, which goes to the heart of the issue here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen the carriers abusing their rights and we have seen, to some degree, the government stepping towards removing some of these rights with this new draft code, but I think we have the right to ask just how much this code can be further tightened. How far can we go before we start to incur legal liabilities? The minister keeps stepping aside from this question. He has said previously that there has been no legal advice. I find it amazing that the government would not understand what its liabilities might be for a whole range of options. The first thing I would have done as the minister would be to seek that advice pretty quick smart.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask again: has the minister sought that legal advice? If so, will he table it? Will he tell the Senate what that advice was? If he has not received any advice, then how does he know how far the code can be tightened? What are we talking about here? Is it just grey cables and undergrounding at intersection? That is okay, we would not be sued for that, but if we allow local government to make these decisions on behalf of their communities, that is somehow gravely more serious in terms of legal liabilities. We have just seen the spectacle of a federal government admitting that it made a mistake on this legislation in the first place but, on the other hand, we say we cannot trust the statistics and we cannot trust local government. They do not know what they are doing. They only represent their local communities. They are only responsible for their streetscapes. They are only responsible for health and safety in their areas. We cannot trust them. Goodness knows what they might decide. They might decide that some suburbs cannot have cables. How terrible! It is quite extraordinary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister talks about the Democrats picking this issue up as a populist cause. I have to say it is, indeed, a popular cause. There have probably been hundreds, if not thousands, of letters received on this subject. They are not from individuals alone; they are from people like the Australian Local Government Association, they are from councils right <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7220"> round this country, they are from the Australian Planning Institute, from the national trusts, from heritage commissions and from conservation groups. Indeed, this is a populist issue. This is one which has raised the interests of a good many people in Australia, Minister. It astounds me that you imagine that the government can go on facilitating the carriers in this way, allowing them to abuse their rights, bringing out some national code which tells them they have to put up grey cables instead of black, and imagining that this will have approval out there in Australia with all those people who are so disaffected by what is going on here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say again, it is most disappointing that we have a federal government that has not known what it is doing, is still not prepared to take any steps to correct the situation, but stands back and accuses other levels of government of being inadequate in this respect. It says that we cannot trust local government. They might veto something&mdash;what a terrible thing! They might veto a decision to put a tower up somewhere or cabling in some street.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats are most disappointed that government will not see its way clear to at least saving Perth and Adelaide from the worst of the excesses of our carriers. I really do want an answer to those questions I raised about legal advice because I think it is crucial. Just how far can the government go in tightening the code? How much more can it demand of the carriers, or are we simply going to waste another inquiry and  another couple of months looking at this draft code, finding inadequacies in it and bringing them forward? Local government everywhere will get involved in this new inquiry, and so it goes on. At the end of the day, it really will not matter.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to emphasise two things to Senator Allison. I made it quite clear&mdash;and I have said this before during the Telstra inquiry&mdash;that it is the advice that we had back in 1991 and 1992. No technical expert gave us any advice that the second or third carrier, or any other carrier, would want to lay cable in what is called the local loop. Now you say we made an error, but all the advice we <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> received&mdash;and that was the technical advice from every expert, even the people who are now Optus&mdash;said they would not lay cable on the local loop. Even they said up until a year and a half ago, when they combined the cables for providing telephony, pay TV and some interactivity, that they found a way that this could be made profitable. That is what I was explaining.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government, on the advice at the time, made a decision in the competitive model that we thought was reasonable. If we had known then what we know now in the wisdom of hindsight, I think the then government&mdash;I was part of it on the telecommunications caucus committee&mdash;would have put a few different things in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the issue of the national code, Senator Allison raised a point which I do not disagree with. If the national code can be changed from time to time to impose new conditions on the carrier and not be sued, therefore, you have conceded the point that obligations can be changed and put on the carrier. Under the new code that you have now put out, you have said they have to make grey cable. That is an obligation. They probably think that does not cost too much, so they are going to accept it. But you have said under the code&mdash;and I do not know what the definition of a major intersection is&mdash;that at major intersections they have to go underground.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been some genuine discussions about sharing the cost of going underground. Some of the costs may be in dispute, but what was initially said by Optus and Telstra about the cost of going underground has been revised substantially in discussions with local government. If you can direct them to do that legally, why can you not, under the code, such as in Adelaide at the moment, say, `You can't roll that out at the moment until you complete the independent investigation on costing'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are not committed. You are not stopping them halfway through. If you can tell them now that at certain intersections they cannot go overhead but have to go underground, that is a direction. It is a direction that they have to use grey cable covering rather than black. Therefore, you are proving <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7221"> that the code can be changed from time to time, even in a period where they have a licence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also have to say something about this issue of being sued. Is there some contract that this parliament is unaware of that the government&mdash;your government or the previous government&mdash;signed that gave commercial protection from a change under the code? As far as I am aware, there is none. If there is no actual contract written, when they got the licence, did they get an exemption to say that until 1997 the code could not be changed? If that has not been put in the code&mdash;that it cannot be changed&mdash;you do have the power, under the existing code, to make directions to them as you are about intersections and the colour of the cable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why can't you say in Adelaide and Perth that this is a reasonable thing? There needs to be an agreement about costing arrangements where, genuinely, people are being involved. Telstra says they will stop the cable being rolled out overhead in Adelaide if Optus stops till the work is done. Optus said, `We will continue the work, but we are going to roll the cable out.' Then immediately Telstra says, `We are going to roll our cable out.' At some time in the next week, as I understand it, they are both going to start rolling. They will do themselves, their own image, their own public standing, enormous damage in the public's mind by rolling two cables out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the question of the legal position of the code is not as you say it is, unless you can prove that there was a contract signed when they got the licence that the code as it then was in 1992 could not change until 1997. We know that is not correct unless there is a contract secretly held somewhere. If it is not held, you are proving, by changing the code now on intersections and on the colouring of the cable, that you can change it and say, `In Adelaide and Perth, you will not roll the cable out until we get some decent costings done.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Allison has raised, I think the code even now has the ability for you to take direct action. You cannot be sued unless you can show that there is a commercial contract which gives them an exemption from the code. The original legislation made it quite <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> clear that the code was not set in place, that it could be changed from time to time at ministerial direction subject to a process of calling for evidence and so on.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are some real ethical problems here. The problems involve allowing someone to purchase the power of government without accountability. What you have is our recognition that the motive of private entities is profit. We have an indication that PR has not been sufficient. The damage in PR has not been sufficient to stop roll&hyphen;outs and huge battles with communities, state governments and local governments so far. We do not have the motive for private carriers to do anything but try to minimise their costs and maximise their market.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The word `yes' has been used a lot in telecommunications. It really is interesting that in this sense it is not market. The market has been taken away because there is no real cost for that community cost. If you exempt carriers from normal regulations on environment&mdash;and it could be habitat; it could be destroying the habitat of a particular species&mdash;the only real choice is `yes'. You have a choice to accept the roll&hyphen;out or you have a choice to accept the roll&hyphen;out in whichever form it comes. That is not even market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If people believe in the market, they should believe in the fact that the community costs are real costs, that they should not be written out of the equation. If the only way community costs can be written into the equation is for appropriate local or regional authorities to have a say, they are also being driven by their own constituency. What we are saying is that that political constituency will not get a say. They will not get a chance to say no at all; they will only have a chance to say yes. Then the market gets a go. It is a free kick. It means the market gets a huge community subsidy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you say that that makes it too expensive then that is the real cost of these decisions. Those real costs should never be written out of the equation. They are real costs&mdash;environmental costs, social costs and amenity costs. If you are saying that you are going to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7222"> give a free kick to industry, they will not have to pay for this social disamenity, they will not have to pay for the real environmental and social costs and they will not have to pay what the community thinks is the real cost of these decisions. They will get a free kick. They will get a huge community subsidy. It goes on and on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not the right thing to do. I think this is not a light issue that any of us have taken in relation to these kinds of issues. The exemption should not continue, in my estimation. It should never have continued in relation to an entity which is no longer fully accountable to the people as a government entity was. It is not appropriate. I think the amendment should be supported.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(5.30 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The starting point is that the 1991 act provided both powers and immunities. That meant that the carriers were entitled to proceed to embark upon a roll-out by whatever means they saw fit, irrespective of state and territory planning and environmental laws. They have been doing that over a period of years. It is not that somehow people have suddenly woken up and said, `Did you realise they are going overhead?' Optus made it clear about two years ago that they were going overhead. They have continued to outlay very significant sums of money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Against that background of there being a statutory ability to proceed through until 1 July by going overhead, which is what the act allowed, there were also provisions that imposed an ability for certain environmental limitations, consistent with those immunities. They were able to be enshrined in a code. As you would know, the code actually did not come into effect until 1994, some three years later. We argued that it should have been tightened, and it was not. Nonetheless, that is what we are proposing to do now, not just <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> grey cables instead of black or major intersections. There are some 20 provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the day, you can only go so far with the code. If the code effectively cuts across those immunities, it is not just a code that is ancillary to the immunities; it is effectively overriding them. You are therefore pulling the rug out&mdash;from what you gave on the one hand, you would be taking them back with the other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not about to table any legal advice, because that certainly would not be in the best interests of the Commonwealth, if it were, in fact, sued, as no doubt Senator Allison would like us to be sued by removing the current powers and immunities as from now. The fact remains that you only have to look at that piece of paper that she has waved around&mdash;I think embarrassingly so&mdash;to recognise that even the library acknowledges that there is a doctrine of promissory estoppel which could found a cause of action that could lead to the Commonwealth incurring multi-million dollar liabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Schacht asked me whether there was any contract in writing. To my knowledge, the answer is no. The doctrine of estoppel is not based on contract; it is based on representations and actions. In other words, you hold out that you will do certain things: I therefore act on those representations to my detriment. In other words, I embark on a roll-out costing me billions of dollars. In those circumstances, you can be stopped from reneging on those representations. Even though there was not anything in writing, by your actions or conduct you led me to embark on a course of action which the law would say was quite justified in the circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the way in which the Commonwealth would be held to be liable by the content of that act, which quite clearly made it plain that there would be immunities from planning regulations which therefore allowed overhead cabling. It is not much consolation to say that if we were all starting afresh, we would have prohibited that. The fact is that from 1 July we will prohibit that, apart from the three&hyphen;month transition arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you were to say, for example, in respect of Adelaide, `I am going to hold you up and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7223"> require you to go off and get an independent assessment', you would effectively be stalling them to the point where they would run out of time.

I was rolling it together and saying that, at worst, you are talking about a further nine&hyphen;month entitlement&mdash;a window of opportunity. If you were to step in and take the Telstra bait, you and I both know that Telstra would love to see Optus brought back to the field and forced to go underground because it would be three times more expensive and it would slow them down quite dramatically. That is precisely what Telstra is on about. Telstra would love to see Optus forced to go underground right now because it would make Optus's business case uncommercial.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To tighten the code in a way that would effectively remove that immunity, which would take away the most important benefit that they have derived from the immunity, which is the ability to go overhead for a limited period of time, you would be going well beyond the concept of a code, which is to make some environmental improvements at the fringe without adversely affecting your entitlement. You would be going beyond that and you would effectively be overriding the immunity. Once you got to that point, the cause of action would clearly be based on the proposition that you have effectively removed the immunities by the back door.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said before, it is the cheap populist option, irrespective of the consequences. No-one is decrying the need to protect the environment or saying that we should not be taking some very serious steps to do just that at the appropriate time, which is 1 July.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The minister has responded to my questions about the power of the code and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7224"> about the legal concept of estoppel, saying that, once there is an undertaking given, once the legislation went through, nothing appears to have changed. From 1991-92, when the legislation went through, up until today, has the minister received any representations from any carrier saying that, as it understands it, there will be no change to the national code and no change to any of the legislative requirements?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is all very well to say that there is a legal concept that says you cannot change it.

Is the minister saying that between 1991 and 1992&mdash;and in 1992 the legislation establishing the competitive model went through&mdash;this parliament, irrespective of the code, if we chose to, was not able to change the arrangements of the competition model?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is an axiomatic constitutional principle that, subject to the constitution only, the Commonwealth parliament has an unfettered and unrestricted power to make laws with respect to peace, order and good management of the Commonwealth in relation to the matters specified in the constitution. It is our opinion that the principles applied in equal effect in respect of changes to the law, including changes to regulatory controls, which are affected by other instruments that are enacted, made or determined pursuant to legislation. There is no reason to differentiate between regulations and such other instruments. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7225"> </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to move on to another point. In the national code the minister has recommended that carriers share ducts. I imagine that this would seem to most members of this house to be a very sensible approach. Duct and infrastructure sharing will only occur once the carriers have been forced to go underground.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Optus are not going to be interested in negotiating on infrastructure sharing whilst they know they can go overhead. If you ask me, that is pretty straightforward. If they had to go underground, I think we could be sure that they would not build their own ducts. We could be sure that they would engage in quite sensible negotiations with Telstra, with councils and with power authorities, as is the case in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suggest that you, Senator Alston, as minister, have the responsibility to ensure that Telstra do not abuse their power over Optus and that these negotiations should be fair. For some time now, local government has been calling for round table discussions where they can sit around and talk this through. It seems to me that a step must be taken now to remove those exemptions. That is critical for any progress to proceed on this matter. It is something the federal government has shown it cannot deal with. I think local government is the appropriate level of government to sort this whole question out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to prolong this debate any further, but I would urge both the opposition and the government to reconsider this. They should see it not just as an opportunity for councils to veto and somehow put in jeopardy this terribly important national infrastructure but also as an opportunity for local government and the states to perhaps sort this problem out. I think we have demonstrated that it is unlikely that legal advice could lead you to suggest that the Commonwealth would be in serious trouble in terms of legal action.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I don't claim to be a legal person&mdash;I have not had the training in this area. But it seems to me that the parliament must have some right to change things for the good government of Australia and to claim that it was in the balancing act of the doctrine of estoppel. What if no&hyphen;one has actually produced what has been written down? You can have a hundred conversations and people are going to claim it all over the place. You can claim whatever you like. That is why I asked the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7227"> specific question&mdash;it was not an assumption&mdash;as to whether there is any evidence around that a representation was made that they acted upon to their detriment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I say again that you would not expect the Commonwealth&mdash;if it did it would be feeling very nervous about it&mdash;to have some document which it effectively regarded as a representation which had been made and which others had acted on to their detriment. The Commonwealth may have a bland record of conversation which it says could not possibly constitute a representation, but that does not stop a plaintiff from arguing it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can easily get bogged down in the law on these things. Everyone accepts that parliaments have got the right to change the law. They are not liable for damages every time they do. That is the starting point. That is the amateur legal aid advice that has been trumpeted around by Senator Allison. But that does not get you very far. What you are talking about here is an absolutely unique circumstance where you are not just making a minor change that might, to some extent, impact on someone's business. You could effectively be killing the whole business case unless you complete your roll&hyphen;out. Unless you get it all together, you do not have a system that is going to generate the payback which you need to stay viable. It does not require much imagination to anticipate how you might actually go over the edge as a result of a fairly minor intervention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While you and I are agreed that this amendment should be opposed, we are talking about a fundamental intervention&mdash;a premature one. We all know that the rules will change on 1 July. This is saying, `To hell with the consequences. Let's go in there and rip up that immunity now. Let's not wait until 1 July. Let's rip it up now. We're not concerned about the fact that Optus or Telstra might have invested billions of dollars. We're not really interested in whether the people of Adelaide get the roll&hyphen;out or not. We're just interested in stopping it stone&hyphen;dead.' I think we have agreed that it is appropriate to have <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a tighter regime and a fundamentally different one from 1 July.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have said all cables will be underground after 1 July, unless state local authorities agree to the contrary. That is a pretty fundamental change. That is where most the angst has been. But, again, we have always accepted that the carriers had rights. Whether they are legal rights or political rights, the fact is that, on the strength of them, they have expended huge amounts of money. To put all that at risk simply because you want to curry a bit of favour with those who believe that local government should have an absolute right of veto in 300 places around the country is not a view that we think is in the national interest.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, that is an argument about the code not going far enough. If there were a process here today which, in detail, changed the powers and immunities to deal with these issues and did not just deal with them by saying, `We're putting it all back to local and state governments,' if there were a structured way of doing it and saying, `We retain an overview for the national interest, and so on, I would probably get the opposition to put their hands up for that. But we have got a plot where you just eliminate the immunities and so on. Although I believe in the restructuring, I have always had the view that local and state governments have got to have an effective say and influence on the outcome.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will not support, and the opposition will not support, walking away and leaving a void in which we abrogate our responsibility constitutionally. That is the difference. If there had been a detailed amendment&mdash;even if it had gone for pages&mdash;to outline the new regime, we would be more willing to support it. That is not before us. I hope it comes before us in the post&hyphen;1997 regulations. It is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7228"> not just a matter of saying, `After 1 July you've got to go underground unless the council says otherwise.' I will be looking at amendments saying that you encourage what is already above the ground, including cables, and a process that encourages all the instrumentalities to go underground, in conjunction with local government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not before us. Therefore, in view of that void, we reluctantly vote against this, even though we will be accused of not doing our best to stop the ugly cables being rolled out. Because that is not before us in a detailed way saying that the Commonwealth should still play a role in all this and that it should not walk away from its constitutional responsibility&mdash;I do not believe that we have a constitutional power&mdash;we should hand it back to the states whether it is in this area or in any other area.

<ROLE>Minister for Communications and the Arts)</ROLE>
<TIME.STAMP>(6.11 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is one thing to espouse a precautionary principle which is normally based on the knowledge that some thing or action will have an actual or potential effect. The fact is that there is not scientific evidence associating health risks with exposure to electromagnetic energy from mobile phone base stations. It would be, in the government's view, an absolute nightmare were we to go down this path.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> I just ask the Senate to think about this for a moment. If Senator Allison seriously con tends that there are dangers flowing from the close location of mobile towers in terms of the emission of electromagnetic energy, then why stop at child-care centres, kindergartens, schools and hospitals? Why should the person living next&hyphen;door to the tower be exposed? What is meant by `child-care centre'? Presumably, a community day care centre or a private day care centre. But what about the children who are in family day care who happen to be living in private homes? Do you somehow ignore their interests? It is logical nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there is any serious basis for these concerns, we would be very much interested in acting on it. If you were serious about this, you would not allow these towers to be located anywhere. Why would you say they could be located alongside houses, fire stations, government departments or, let us say, a recreation centre where children are busy playing sport in the afternoon of every day, and then try to preclude a location within 300 metres of what you would just pick out as a few, presumably, highly emotional and emotive examples of people who you think might be exposed? In other words, you are more likely to get a headline if you focus on children; I presume that is the sort of rationale for that. If you were in any way, shape or form seriously contending that there were health dangers, why would you stop at child-care centres, kindergartens, schools and hospitals? There can be no logic to that at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, if you say that you cannot locate within 300 metres, the problems are much greater than that. Presumably, you have not in the slightest attempted to identify how this would play out in practice; in other words, you would have to have done very detailed mapping of all of those particular structures and their relative locations, and then see what black holes might emerge. But you have absolutely no idea of the impact of this. It could well devastate the rollout.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Schacht mentioned earlier that he had a tower close to his place. I have one pretty close to my place. It happens to be about 50 metres from one of the largest girls schools in Melbourne. I have not heard any complaints about it.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7230">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point is that within a kilometre of my place there are six secondary schools. What you would probably find on the strength of this would be that when you combined child-care centres, kindergartens, schools and hospitals you would not have a mobile phone tower for miles. You would simply have a dirty big black hole which would, you would think, not only be to the detriment of local residents who might like to use the service but also disadvantage those travelling through that area and anyone from around Australia making a call into that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The practical consequence would likely be that, because you were precluded from erecting towers in a vast number of areas because of the conjunction of those four structures, you would have to build higher towers and probably more of them. What do you achieve by doing all of that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The advice I have had is that if handsets were used in places like schools, where there would be no towers in the vicinity, then there would be a higher level of radiation from those handsets to compensate for the fact that the signals would have to travel a further distance to the nearest tower. So again it would be utterly counterproductive if there was a serious environmental or health basis for these concerns. You would simply be ensuring that those people were exposed to a much higher level of radiation than others who did not have to suffer that distance problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has recently committed $4.5 million over, I think, five years to make absolutely sure that these concerns are addressed with the greatest degree of responsibility, that we continue to monitor the situation and that we do not in any shape or form run risks that anyone in the community would regard as unacceptable. The World Health Organisation is undertaking studies on a regular basis. There are people around the world who are doing research in this area. We have an interdepartmental committee that has been working on the issue as well. All of those programs are designed to make absolutely sure that there are not any risks that might emerge without us being aware of them. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But to date no risks have been identified. As I understand it, even Dr Hocking conceded that his findings were not a basis on which firm conclusions could be drawn. Dr Hocking has emphasised in meetings with officials from the Department of Communications and the Arts that his findings are preliminary and that no firm conclusions should be drawn from them. So on what conceivable basis would you rush to impose such a draconian limit on the location of mobile phone towers? I did not hear any argumentation, but I presume you are simply concerned with the health aspects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have to have regard to the purpose of the mobile phone towers, which purpose does not ever seem to get a mention in these discussions. They are there for a very real and obvious community benefit. You ought to be aware that the new code, which we hope will be able to be proclaimed prior to Christmas, will contain a requirement for mandatory co-location of towers, unless it is not technically feasible. In other words, we will go much further than the current code allows in terms of co-location. There is still the requirement for consultation, and that is going to be beefed up. But at the end of the day to arbitrarily come in and say that towers cannot be located within 300 metres of a whole range of structures that you just happen to have picked out of the air, so it would seem, could fundamentally damage that whole network.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I acknowledge that to some degree the choice of kindergartens, schools, child-care centres and hospitals is somewhat arbitrary. But there is some logic behind that, and it is that there are plenty of medical researchers who are of the view that children can absorb 3.3 times, I think, as much radioactivity through various frequencies as adults do. I imagine that those who presented to the Telstra inquiry selected those structures because they are the places that children frequent. They are the places where children spend much of their day and where they would have a regular, long-term exposure to electromagnetic radiation. That is the reason for choosing those places.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are plenty of people in this country who do not like the idea of the towers being near their houses, and no doubt they would like us to nominate locations 300 metres away from all residences, too. I have to say that I would be inclined to that view, too. The reason we have stopped at that is that we have tried to go as far as we can in order to get a positive outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously we cannot prevent towers going up everywhere. Already they are in many locations, and sometimes inside school and kindergarten environs. What we are simply trying to do is to stop further towers from going up in those areas where we think there is the greatest risk.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I warn the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) against the industry attitude, `There is no evidence, therefore there is no risk.' I would be quite happy to cite the very many opinions, expressed by people who know about these things much better than I do, about the growing evidence that there is a health risk associated with electromagnetic radiation. I will start with Professor John Goldsmith, who in a recent study, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Epidemiology provides a growing number of reports which find health status change, including increased cancers, miscarriage, brain activity changes, anxiety, sleep disorders, et cetera, in association with above average exposure to radio frequency and microwave radiation.</PARA>
<PARA>He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are strong political and economic reasons for needing there to be no health effect of this exposure just as there are very strong public health reasons for more accurately portraying the risks. Those of us who intend to speak for public health must be ready for opposition which is nominally but not truly scientific.</PARA>
<PARA>The minister is doing that. He is attempting to say that, because there is no hard evidence, we should just go ahead. He suggests that those of us who propose any measures that might protect people must necessarily be emotional. In fact, I think he used the words `highly emotional'. He suggests it is not serious, that this is really just a figment of somebody's imagination and that we are trying to drum up, with no justification, emotional responses to something.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would be quite happy to stand here and go through the very substantial and growing body of evidence which shows that there is convincing evidence of biological effects from electromagnetic radiation. I appeal to you to consider it. But I do not want to go through it tonight because we are under great time pressures. I would offer any senator who would like further information on the sort of work that is being done already to contact me. I would be happy to provide them with any number of reports. My office now has a very substantial library of the evidence which has already been developed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The evidence does not say, `Yes, we will all get brain tumours because we use mobile <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7232"> phones, or because we live next door to mobile phone towers.' It simply says that there is much we do not know, that cancers develop over a long period of time and that children in particular should be protected. Minister, you know as well as everybody else in this chamber that towers have been with us for only a very short time and that most of the telecommunications infrastructure that is now in our environment was not there a few years ago. So it is not possible to do longitudinal studies&mdash;I think that is the right terminology&mdash;that show the effects over time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The work that has been done is very preliminary, and it is necessarily so because we have not adopted the precautionary principle. We have simply said, `We all want mobile phones, so let us put up towers in kindergartens, schools and anywhere else that is convenient,' without worrying about whether we are putting children at risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would be quite happy to prolong this debate and to raise all of the early research findings that have come across my desk. I know there will be even more than that. I will be happy to start to work through them. If the minister wants to maintain the line that there is no evidence and therefore there is no problem, then I am happy to argue the other view. I certainly wish the government would not make those claims. I do not believe that they are right.</PARA></SPEECH>

<STATE> (Tasmania)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(6.27 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What Senator Allison has just said makes good sense. I will answer some of the questions the Minister for Communications and Arts (Senator Alston) asked of the senator. The first concerns the precautionary principle. Where there is an apparent inherent danger, you take the precaution of not extending that danger. You wait until you know that the hazard has gone or the danger is not real. You do not do it the other way around.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those who have studied the epidemiology of lung cancer coming from smoking, and mesotheliomas coming from asbestos, would get to see that the early warning signs are very often suppressed by those who have a real commercial motive to not take precautions. When the minister pooh-poohs the idea that the bottom line, the profit line, does not <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> dictate to government in situations like this to the detriment of the wider populous, he should look at that history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point of Senator Allison saying that schools and child-care centres should be given protection until at least it is known that these towers are not a health hazard is that it is recognised that children are more vulnerable to many forms of radiation. We know, for example, that it is primarily children who are affected at Sellafield, in the United Kingdom, by the very&hyphen;difficult&hyphen;to&hyphen;specify radiation coming from a nuclear power reactor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rates of leukemia and blood cell-related diseases are higher amongst children in that vicinity than they are in the rest of the populace or populations elsewhere. That is simply because children are growing, their cells are dividing faster and they are more vulnerable to the impact of radiation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When it comes to electromagnetic radiation, very little is known compared to other forms of radiation. But the danger signs are there and the concerns are there, and they are in the scientific community. It is not just a group of people who are simply floating a scare campaign. Precaution and commonsense would say that Senator Allison should be listened to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I go to one other point which would be otherwise completely missed in this debate about these towers, and that is the visual intrusion, the visual pollution that they cause not only in urban areas but also in some of the most scenically sensitive areas in this nation. If you drive down the Midlands Highway in Tasmania from Launceston to Hobart, you will find that towers have recently sprouted on Gunns Quoin and on the eastern part of the Great Western Tiers, on some of the most important visual parts of the skyline of a state that depends very much on its wild and scenic attraction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7233"> There is no environmental study or impact assessment required. It is simply that the corporations who are making money out of the spread of these towers put them where they think it is going to be best for them. It is something that the community should have an input into; it is something that should be taken into account. But, I guess, if the government is not going to listen to argu ments about the health of children, it is not going to listen to arguments about the protection of the environmental amenity in a wider sense.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Briefly, the government does not for a moment lack concern on this issue. I make it clear that we currently do have in this country standards which establish EME levels that are considered to be safe. The AS2772.1 is one of the most stringent exposure standards in the world. It has been developed following the consideration of substantiated scientific evidence, including non&hyphen;thermal evidence by appropriately qualified technical and scientific experts. The level of energy involved at ground level in a mobile phone base station transmission is approximately 100 times less than the exposure level permitted by that standard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 15 October, the government announced that it would provide $4.5 million over five years&mdash;firstly, for a public information dissemination strategy; secondly, for continuing participation in the World Health Organisation project to assess the health and environmental effects of EME exposure; and, thirdly, an independent Australian research program.

I realise that the matter was dealt with by the committee during its consideration. In fact, it is referred to in this report.

I am concerned that, if something is not done at this point in time, you will have carriers making sure that they get in to the prime spots&mdash;irrespective of whether there are schools, hospitals or whatever around the place.

Before getting to the full discussion next March or April, I would have thought 150 metres, but perhaps 200 metres might be a compromise.

If you were serious about wanting to go down this path, the very least you ought to do is identify the impact that it would have and whether it is, in fact, practical.

I acknowledge that there was some difficulty in arriving at 300 metres. People have asked, `Why not 500 metres?' and `Why not 150 metres?' As Senator Harradine rightly points out, we do not know.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The evidence we have, however, is that around a mobile phone tower&mdash;this comes to me from the Telstra research laboratories in Clayton in Victoria&mdash;there is a doughnut shape. At 150 metres, the greatest concentration of electromagnetic radiation exists. That is the basis for saying that 150 metres is obviously not enough, because that would place us right in the centre of this area of high concentration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also does not take into account, as I understand it, co&hyphen;location. The government is on the one hand arguing that we should have Vodafone, Telstra and Optus with their towers co&hyphen;located. Does that add to the concentration <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> or widen the doughnut? I do not know. This is so important that if Senator Harradine is prepared to support this at 200 metres, the Democrats are as well. I am happy to change our amendment to reflect that. I acknowledge that we are all in the dark here. It is an argument for spending money on real research that can tell us what is safe and which says, `Look, you don't put these up in the middle of places where children are' or `They are okay to have in parks but not in industrial areas.' We just do not know the answers to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is about precaution. It is about children and precaution and at least putting in place some measures before it is too late and we have all the towers erected everywhere and emitting electromagnetic radiation. I argue that it will be much more difficult for us to remove these towers if we find that there is a problem. We may have that as a problem further down the track.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Alston tells us that it has nothing to do with the sale of Telstra. Quite a lot that we have talked about today and quite a lot that is in the bill does not have to do with the sale. It is an opportunity that is not to be missed. Over the next six months, if we do not do something about it, it may well be too late. I am willing to alter this amendment to reflect 200 metres.

<PARA>Amendment 21 does two things: firstly, it guarantees, free of charge, 24&hyphen;hour access to operator or assisted directory services as part of the universal service obligation; secondly, it guarantees 24&hyphen;hour access, free of charge, to emergency calls as part of the universal service obligation. There has been widespread discussion saying that charging for both directory assistance and emergency calls is a development which is not too far away. Indeed, in the November edition of the Telstra operator assistance services newsletter, charging for directory assistance is highlighted as a high priority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been rumoured that Telstra already has the technology in place to enable such charging to take place and that they are simply waiting for the go&hyphen;ahead from the government, or at least some indication that there will be no impediment to their so doing. It is important to recognise, however, that consumers already meet the cost of such services through rental and through call charges, even though a charge is not levied on a per call basis. Introducing a pay per call fee, without corresponding reductions in existing charges, we would argue, would be a double slug.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Writing the provision of directory assistance and emergency call services into the universal service obligation will ensure such services are not charged on a per call basis and will ensure that the cost of providing such services is borne proportionately by all carriers.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government opposes this amendment because the provision of directory assistance and access to emergency call services are guaranteed now under carrier licence conditions. But, more importantly, what this purports to do is to bring these services within the universal service obligation ambit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effect of that would be to confine the obligation to provide those services to only those customers who subscribe to the services of the universal service provider, currently Telstra. So, if you are an Optus customer, you <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7236"> would not get the benefit of this particular proposal even if it were necessary in the first instance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But after 1 July, when all carriers will be covered under licence conditions, you will, hopefully, have a lot more competition in the marketplace, a lot more people who are not beholden to the universal service provider, and, in those circumstances, a lot more people who simply would not come within the ambit of this provision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does not do anything to protect anyone. It simply covers a particular portion of the community&mdash;a proportion which will shrink over time. It simply replicates provisions that are already in licence conditions, and that will continue after July 1997.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps I had better explain. The universal service obligation is imposed on the universal service provider. That is currently Telstra. At the moment, Telstra has an obligation to provide a range of services. They then get the benefit of the cross-subsidy through the fund. So it is Telstra who provides the service. That means that if you are a Telstra customer you get the benefit of that, but if you are not you do not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the moment it is only Optus who is in the marketplace as an alternative, but post-July, when you would hope there would be a lot more players in the marketplace, the universal service provider will overwhelmingly remain Telstra. There may be some areas <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in the country where someone else might put up their hand and volunteer, in which case they would be the universal service provider in that region.</PARA>

But, in the meantime, as I think this will be, at the latest, proclaimed on 1 May&mdash;and we can have a look at it again&mdash;I do not think it is unreasonable to put this in. If the universal service provider is Telstra, at the moment or on 1 July, then let it be that they will continue with this (e) and (f) provision. Then we can have a look in March&hyphen;April next year, when we deal with the bill, and ensure that all those other carriers who come in will themselves have to have this provision put on them to meet the universal service obligation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think anybody here would support any future carrier getting away from having the same obligation put on them. So in March next year&mdash;from what I understand you have said&mdash;when we deal with the overall telecommunications bill, we do not want any of the future carriers to escape universal service obligations. We should amend the bill accordingly. In the meantime, until 1 July, I do not see anything wrong with adding (e) and (f) now. Then that should be the basis of ensuring that all future carriers also provide the same universal service obligation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no point in doing it here. The place to do it is in the licence conditions. When you <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7237"> debate the post-1997 legislation, you can have a very good look at that to make sure that it meets those concerns. But to do it now, some months ahead of it coming in&mdash;because I think we are not just talking about 1 May on this; we may well be talking about it coming into effect earlier&mdash;it seems to me that, again, on the run, you are doing something that is really quite the opposite of what you have in mind.

<PARA>It is perfectly legitimate for legislation to spell out the desirable skills or organisations to be represented on boards. Appointment of a person with skills in consumer affairs has precedence both on the boards of Austel and of ACCC. There is no legitimate reason, we <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7239"> would argue, why the same should not also hold for Telstra. Such an appointment would ensure a more added focus on customers and customer related matters at board level. I think, if the government is serious about making Telstra more responsive to the interests of customers, as the government has said it is, it should have no difficulty in guaranteeing consumers a voice at board level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The appointment of a union representative to a board is common, although it is perhaps unlikely under the present government. Until recently we have had, for example, Bill Kelty on the board of the Reserve Bank. While on the board of Telstra, we had ACTU Assistant Secretary Mr Bill Mansfield, who was recently dismissed with a number of other members. Notably, one of the replacements and now the deputy chair, Mr John Ralph, is the CEO of CRA and architect of their industrial relations policy. While, no doubt, Mr Ralph has tremendous experience in industrial relations, it is important to question whether a voice like his is the only one the government should appoint, especially given the massive downsizing that Telstra is currently embarking on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ensuring that a union representative with a solid background in industrial relations is appointed will, we argue, help encourage industrial democracy and ensure the board has input from a more diverse range of views than it does at present. We believe this is a measure which should be supported by every senator who is genuinely concerned with job losses at Telstra.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would simply indicate that it is our view that this is not a constituency board. You should not have people there in a representative capacity. They should be there on their merits. You want people with all of the requisite skills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment says that you have to have knowledge of consumer affairs. I would have thought that is so vague that it is meaningless. I would be amazed if you could not appoint anyone who at least claimed to have some knowledge of consumer affairs, but that is really a criticism of the way in which it was drafted. The idea of having both a unionist <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and a consumer affairs representative&mdash;if that is really what you had intended&mdash;goes quite contrary to the notion of decisions being made in the best interests of the company. You would have people being beholden to outside groups to try to get appointed in the first place and to stay there in the second place. It seems to us that this sends a very poor signal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have thought it would be readily apparent that, if Telstra is to compete effectively, particularly after 1 July, it has to be customer focused and consumer oriented; it has to be selling its products. In other words, it has to be acutely aware of consumer needs. It ignores those at its peril.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, some of the people we have recently appointed did, I thought, have a particular focus on marketing skills and on awareness of consumer needs, but I would expect that all directors would have an acute sensitivity to consumer interests and to the industrial relations interests. What you do not want is simply to have someone there because they have been in a union. It seems to me that is no qualification for anything. You are much better off to have people who have a demonstrated knowledge of the industrial relations system; whether or not they come from either side of the fence does not really matter. It might be a retired judge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The idea of having constituents represented on the board is fundamentally antagonistic to the concept of a commercial organisation. Austel and the ACCC are regulators. I am not sure that I would even agree that they should have consumer representatives on those boards but&mdash;</PARA>

Senator Allison argues that because we have these types of people on Austel and on the ACCC we, therefore, should have them on Telstra, as though somehow these three bodies are analogous. They are not. Two are regulators and one is a commercial player. It has commercial interest. It ought to be acutely aware of those sensitivities in any event.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is true, but he got the chop because he was from the ACTU. Other people who are members of the Business Council of Australia did not get the chop. In fact, some of them got appointed. Mr Ralph&mdash;and I think he is chairman of the Business Council of Australia&mdash;got appointed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Business Council of Australia is almost the alternate replica of the ACTU. The Business Council of Australia represents bosses; the ACTU represents workers. Mr Ralph gets appointed. He is not seen as representing a sectional interest. My God, that is not right. He certainly is representing a sectional interest in the background he comes from. As a director, he will carry out his due diligence, just as Mr Mansfield would have. They understand their due diligence and they add expertise around the table.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, if you had not gone enthusiastically with the axe through half a dozen members of the board in the way that you did, this amendment might not have been necessary. It is clear that either you or some of your colleagues in cabinet are going to go about chopping up anybody who seems to be either a consumer rep or a trade union rep or someone who has a trade union background.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we appointed members to the Telstra board in the past, they were overwhelmingly business representatives or people with business background. We thought it was not unreasonable having one person there who has trade union experience in view of the fact that the organisation employs 70,000, even going to down to 50,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we believe it is not unreasonable to add these two qualifications because, unfortunately, this government does seem to be bent on <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> removing anybody who does not fit the business description coming from that sectional interest.</PARA></SPEECH>

<STATE> (Victoria)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(7.39 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not go on at great length because I understand that we are trying to wrap this up by 8 o'clock. But in my only other single contribution to this debate I expressed some concerns about this particular matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first concern I expressed is: why is this going to a legislation committee, given that the government was massively opposed to a legislative matter going to a reference committee some months ago? I wondered why they had done such a backflip. This does not actually affect legislation; this legislation, presumably, will at least have passed its third reading. It will not have got to the proclamation stage&mdash;I acknowledge that. Nevertheless, it is to deal with principles, and they would be much better at a reference committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not really have a concern about which of the two committees it goes to, only to point out that I do not want any plaintiff squeals from the other side in future if things have been referred to what they regard as the wrong committee. And certainly that is not a criticism at this stage of Senator Harradine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, I do not understand why we would have a report date by 26 March when it is not going to actually influence the legislation. Thirdly, I wonder why we are having an inquiry when the government is going to reject any recommendations that come out of it. Senator Harradine was kind enough to pass on to me some of the views put to him by Treasury. Therefore, there may be some purpose in this inquiry, as I understand, to check the veracity of the views of Treasury and whether, in fact, they have approached this in a fair manner, a logical manner, and whether they can stand up to the scrutiny of the committee. As such, maybe it will have some useful purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, let me say that I think the government has made up its mind on this, and it is not going to affect anything in particular. I would like to ask Senator Alston whether he will be present in the January hearings, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> especially in the early January hearings, to assist the committee with its inquiries. I am sure that Senator Cook, my esteemed colleague who actually is a full&hyphen;time member of this committee, looks forward to the company of Senator Alston at that committee especially in, let us say, the first three weeks of January. He is however willing, Senator Alston, to visit you, wherever you may be at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would make one other point on this. I hope that it is understood, given the timing and the timetable of this&mdash;and it does not affect me&mdash;that the Senate would not in any way inhibit this committee sitting when the Senate sits in February and March. Let us face it: not many of the committee members will be available in January&mdash;let us be serious about that. Then we sit, I think, six weeks out of eight in February and March. So I think it would only be fair&mdash;and I know we do not like to do it&mdash;for the committee to be given leave to sit while the Senate is sitting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most of the evidence, I think, will come from people in Canberra; I do not know how many people from outside will be giving evidence. Again I say that it is going to the wrong committee. But that is great because the other side can never complain again if they vote for this particular thing. I regret that Senator Alston will not be able to give of his expertise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude on this note: having watched the debate rather than having participated, I congratulate the participants in this debate&mdash;Senator Schacht representing the Labor Party; the minority parties; and you too, Senator Alston. Senator Alston actually approached the committee stage in a constructive way, tried to deal with it and kept his temper all the way through&mdash;as far as I could see. So, apart from the first day, which he knew was a bit of a blow&hyphen;out day, the committee stage of this particular bill has been done very constructively. It is a model for any of the other shadow ministers and ministers to look at.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(7.42 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the opposition, I indicate that we will be supporting Senator Margetts's amendment. We have already gone over earlier&mdash;and it seems like three or four <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7243"> weeks ago, but in fact it was only a couple of days ago&mdash;the difference between Senator Harradine's amendment to the committee report and Senator Margetts's. Again we will state just very simply: to us it is irrelevant if this goes off to a committee. The government will not change its mind. After the legislation is carried on the third reading, any report from the committee will be dispensed to the rubbish bin and have no effect at all, other than to delay the proclamation date.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But this bill will be proclaimed, as passed today in the Senate with amendments, at that time. So the work of the committee, in my view and the view of the opposition, will basically be irrelevant&mdash;other than for those who want to have a bit of blood sport with Treasury, over Senator Harradine's response to the Treasury, to Mr Costello's letter. It may be of a bit of interest to us on the committee to have an argument with Treasury about the veracity of their views versus Senator Harradine's.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Margetts's amendment is the correct one. If we are to have a committee dealing with the contents of a major amendment, a major issue about how Telstra preference shares could be sold, et cetera, it is only appropriate that the bill be referred back&mdash;recommitted, as Senator Margetts has said. That makes the work of the committee relevant rather than irrelevant. I think that this is a procedure that, in a way, will debase the operation of Senate committees because, as we have said before&mdash;and I say again&mdash;the government will ignore any recommendation that comes from the work of this committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the committee stage of this bill there have been some accusations that we have been filibustering. The reason there were a number of committee stage speeches of up to 15 minutes by the opposition was that, when the minister summed up at the end of the second reading debate, he did not sum up all the arguments he had heard; he announced a completely new arrangement that he had reached with Senator Colston and Senator Harradine. A whole new dimension was put before us which no-one in the opposition parties or even in the government parties had a chance to comment on during the second <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reading debate. That is why we took the opportunity to make a number of speeches about what had happened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, we used the opportunity in the first few hours to ask the minister a number of questions to flesh out the arrangements of the deal made by Senator Harradine, Senator Colston and the government. It took until the second day for the minister to table a two-page document outlining how the telecommunications infrastructure fund for regional areas would work. If we had not been in here pushing that and asking question after question, debate on this bill would have come and gone with no information available to the people of Australia and without any detail of substance about how that fund would work. So we did take that opportunity to keep pushing until the minister obviously tabled his document. Skimpy as it is, it still in no way equates with the National Heritage Trust Fund, which is separate legislation. We made our comments about all those deficiencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Ray suggested, once we got into the detail of the amendments this committee stage worked reasonably well. But this in no way diminishes the opposition's total and absolute opposition to the partial sale of Telstra. We did want to deal with the amendments. We had some success with a couple. Whether the House of Representatives accepts them is a matter for the government to determine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have commented privately to Senator Alston, in March of next year we will have the 600&hyphen;page post-1997 telecommunications regulatory bill. The fact that a dozen amendments moved to the Telstra bill took a day and a half to deal with really shows to the government and to us all that we will have to deal seriously in the Senate legislative committee on telecommunications with a range of material. There is going to have to be a lot of cooperation on this 600-page telecommunications bill, because an opposition even without the numbers can hang out any government to dry, with endless amendments and discussion that would blow out any arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have indicated to Senator Alston all the way through that both sides will have to cooperate in getting that bill through. We will <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7244"> have to have a lot of patience, because we will be dealing with extremely technical information and technical amendments. I again indicate that we support Senator Margetts's amendment. We will oppose and call a division on the third reading to show our total opposition in principle to the partial privatisation of Telstra.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TITLE>Nuclear Weapons</TITLE>
<PROCTEXT>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech that Senator Margetts was granted leave to incorporate read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Greens today launched the Global Abolition 2000 Campaign in Parliament House. We also moved a motion to get the support of the Senate for the global campaign which calls for the abolition of nuclear weapons by the year 2000 and a nuclear weapons convention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Abolition 2000 Campaign is about spearheading new ways to keep up the pressure on nuclear disarmament. So far, we have had international responses plagued with pragmatism and compromise in the Non-Proliferation Treaty and the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7246"> Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty which have perpetuated the status quo. Granted, the CTBT may stop nuclear testing in the environment, however laboratory testing and nuclear weapons research and development will continue which preserves the status of the 5 nuclear weapons states.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have also seen the success of grassroots community campaigning for nuclear disarmament resulting in the World Court decision that pronounced the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons to be illegal. Abolition 2000&mdash;a global network of people campaigning for negotiations for a nuclear weapons convention by the-year 2000 arose out of the 10 year World Court campaign. The Abolition Campaign was launched today at Parliament House and is supported by over 600 international organisations and 38 Australian organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to draw the Senate's attention to the vote today at the UN General Assembly which the Government has been very quiet on. This is the Malaysian resolution which calls for negotiations for a nuclear weapons convention by the year 2000. The outcome of the Malaysian resolution exposes the lie of the Government and both the major parties for that matter, in taking pseudo disarmament initiatives which they have no sincerity in pursuing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Malaysian Government and 32 other cosponsoring countries pipped Australia at the post in terms of taking a proactive stance on nuclear disarmament. The Malaysian resolution is the first international response to the outcome of the World Court decision and is a fine example of the direction we should be moving in. However, Australia has abstained on this vote at the UN, kowtowing to the position of the US and other nuclear nations who want to keep their arsenals. The vote came up in Committee in mid November and Australia abstained. All the nuclear states except China voted No. Ninety seven countries including Afghanistan, Brazil, Ghana and many in our region such as Singapore, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, India, Indonesia, Burma, Samoa, Papua New Guinea, Vietnam and Solomon Islands supported the resolution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This vote was repeated in New York last night and we have not yet seen the final results however, we know that Australia has abstained again, this time at the Plenary session of the UN General Assembly. Other countries are expected to vote as they did before which renders similar results (ie around 97 supporters, 20 against and 25 abstentions). This ultimately means that the Malaysian resolution has been successful and renders Australia's position as very foolish and hypocritical.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Malaysian resolution called for negotiations to take place before the year 2000 which led to a nuclear weapons convention. It does not call for a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> nuclear weapons convention by the year 2000&mdash;but for the beginning of negotiations to be taking place by that time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's excuse as to why it could not support this resolution has been shameful and woefully inadequate. It has claimed that a nuclear weapons convention with a timebound framework for the phased elimination of nuclear weapons is too prescriptive and unachievable. However, it was not long ago that former Foreign Minister Gareth Evans called the World Court Project `hopelessly utopian' and that it wouldn't gain a successful outcome&mdash;and of course it did through a 10 year campaign which Australia did not support until the very last minute. The Government also claims it cannot support the Malaysian resolution because it does not allow for the Canberra Commission report recommendations. This is utter rubbish and an overt lie.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As we all know, our Government facilitated the Canberra Commission report which called on Governments to undertake a series of steps to generate momentum for nuclear disarmament, including negotiations for US and Russian arsenal reductions, taking nuclear forces off alert, the dismantling of warheads from delivery vehicles and no first use undertakings. The Malaysian resolution builds on this and accepts the stages outlined by the Canberra Commission as long as they lead to negotiations for a nuclear weapons abolition convention. The resolution accepts that smaller steps are necessary as long as countries agree on the end goal of nuclear disarmament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would now like to turn to what other countries are doing in response to the World Court decision which will also point to the complete inadequacy of the Australian Government's response to the ruling on the illegality of nuclear weapons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Action that other countries are taking in response to the World Court decision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On November 8, 1996, the Canadian Government announced an initiative to review its nuclear policy in light of the World Court decision on the legality of the threat or use of nuclear weapons. Canada relies on the US nuclear weapons arsenal and does not have any of its own, however it is in partnership with the US in NORAD&mdash;the North American Aerospace Defence Command which controls a network of radar stations involved in nuclear defence. The outcome may be that Canada pulls out of NORAD.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Canada also has full public support for the pro-active stance they are taking. Canada has organised a Cross Canada series of Roundtables on nuclear disarmament which determined that a broad section of Canadian society welcomes and rallies behind the Canadian Government's position in working to secure an international nuclear weapons abolition program. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7247"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In September 1996, 404 community leaders in 18 cities and 10 provinces participated in the Project Ploughshares talks which endorsed policies to achieve a nuclear abolition agreement in response to questions posed by the Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister on Canada's response to the World Court. The roundtable discussion endorsed international law over NATO defence, endorsed a resolution for a nuclear weapons abolition convention and a step by step comprehensive framework to lead to nuclear disarmament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have also seen Field Marshal Lord Carver speak up for the elimination of nuclear weapons. He was chief of the defence staff in 1973-1976 and is acknowledged as one of Britain's best military thinkers. His view is that "a major effort should now be made for a real, genuine and unequivocal commitment by the declared nuclear weapon States to the target of total elimination and for them to demonstrate that by a number of steps they would need to fulfil." Interestingly he also believes that the enlargement of NATO is a grave mistake because it is the major obstacle for Russia and the US to commence Start III on the further reduction of their nuclear arsenals. START III was also one of the steps recommended by the Canberra commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mikhail Gorbachev has also said that "we must move to abolish nuclear weapons." Other top military leaders such as General Lee Butler and General Charles Horner have spoken out with Field Marshall Lord Carver saying that nuclear weapons are not necessary and have called for their elimination.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Belgian activists have invaded military bases to expose the illegality of nuclear weapons in a Belgian military base after the World Court decision. The judge has been sympathetic to the world court decision in making his verdict. Dutch activists have also trespassed an air base to bring the nuclear weapons on the base to public attention. The advisory opinion will again be used during the trial.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Norwegian law Professor believes the implications of the ICJ decision are that NATO states such as Norway will have to change their nuclear policies (specifically their NATO B4s defence plans) in order to avoid criminal liability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The world court decision has also opened up the floodgates in Ireland where Irish people will now be able to sue companies for personal injury claims thought to be caused by nuclear contamination. There is much research into the links between nuclear plants and cancer clusters and many people have suffered from the pollution in the Irish sea from Sellafield and accidents at Dounreay and Greenham. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is evident that there has been much civil action and Government attempts to work actively with the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> World Court Judgement. One important observation was the fact that the public do not realise the enormous strides that have been made in the international agenda to put nuclear weapons back at the centre of the agenda. There is now an opportunity to build on the small steps that have been made in response to the CTBT and NPT. The NPT was signed with an obligation for states to pursue negotiations for nuclear disarmament. The Canberra Commission refrained from calling for a Nuclear Weapons Abolition Convention but is supportive of states pursuing negotiations in good faith to lead to total nuclear disarmament without being prescriptive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now we have a real opportunity to push forward with a nuclear weapons abolition convention through the Malaysian initiative (supported by 32 countries and not Australia).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Abolition 2000 network and World Court Project have produced an action plan for nuclear weapons states, non-nuclear weapons states and action to be taken at the United Nations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As Australia falls into the non-nuclear weapons states, the World Court Project and Abolition 2000 team believe domestic legislation could be passed distancing Australia from an illegal defence strategy citing the advisory opinion. Those allied with the nuclear powers in their defence such as Australia with the US should review their foreign and defence policies. This would include military bases, exercises, aircraft overflights and landing and nuclear armed warship port access and transit. New Zealand has recently signed a Memorandum of Cooperation with South Africa to work for a nuclear free Southern Hemisphere challenging nuclear alliances like ANZUS. Australia could be dissolving the nuclear alliance, strengthening nuclear weapon free zones and hastening other disarmament initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Instead, however the Government has recently upgraded ANZUS through the AUSMIN talks and is looking at upgrading Pine Gap, upgrading US defence exercises, allowing a nuclear powered submarine to endanger the fragile Queensland coastline and sit adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef&mdash;a World Heritage area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is an appalling pro-nuclear position that the Australian Government is taking. It goes against international law, common morality and environmental and social justice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Abolition 2000 network is a part of the campaign for a convention and sincere measures to disarm and dismantle the existing nuclear arsenal, deployment and delivery systems. It is important that Senators are aware and supportive of the Abolition 2000 initiative so the Government is forced to take a proactive stance on these issues.</PARA></PROCTEXT></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator Vanstone</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Attorney-General has provided the following answers to the honourable senator's questions:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Declaration made by former Attorney-General, Mr Lionel Bowen on 20 July 1989, and notified in the `Gazette' on 24 July 1989, did not declare that it was in the interests of the defence of Australia for Australian citizens to be exempt from the provisions of the Crimes (Foreign Incursions <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7250"> and Recruitment) Act 1978. It only declared that it was in the interests of the defence of Australia to permit the recruitment in Australia by the Government of Papua New Guinea or its contractors or agents, of persons to serve in or with the Papua New Guinea Defence Force in any capacity for the purpose of facilitating the use of four Iroquois helicopters supplied to that Government by the Australian Government. This permission was subject to the condition that the Government of Papua New Guinea not recruit in Australia for that purpose any person who was a member of the Permanent Naval Forces, the Australian Regular Army, the Regular Army Supplement or the Permanent Air Force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The declaration had and continues to have one effect and one effect only, namely, that it prevents it being an offence under subsection 9(1) of the Act for steps to be taken for the recruitment in Australia of people (other than members of the named forces) for service in or with the Papua New Guinea Defence Force to facilitate the use of the four specified Iroquois helicopters. However, even without the declaration, it would not be contrary to the Act for Australians to serve in or with the Papua New Guinea Defence Force to facilitate the use of the helicopters or for any other purpose. Paragraph 6(4)(a) of the Act applies whether or not a declaration has been made under subsection 9(2). It states that the prohibition on Australians engaging in hostile activities in a foreign State does not apply where they are serving in or with the armed forces of the government of a foreign State. (On the other hand, it is contrary to the Act for an Australian to serve in or with another armed force, say, a rebel force, unless the Minister makes a declaration in respect of it under subsection 9(2)).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The answers to the specific parts of the question are:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) No.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) In relation to Australians serving in or with the armed forces of the governments of foreign States, such data is not, and should not, be available, because such service is not contrary to Australian law. In relation to Australians serving with forces other than government armed forces, if such data was available, it would not be disclosed on the basis that it might prejudice investigations of criminal offences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) In relation to Australians serving in or with the armed forces of the governments of foreign <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> States, (a), (b), (c), and (d) are not known. In relation to Australians serving in or with forces other than government armed forces, if such data was available, it would not be disclosed on the basis that it might prejudice investigations of criminal offences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) In relation to Australians serving in or with the armed forces of the government of Papua New Guinea, (a), (c), (d) and (e) are not known. No persons other than Australian military personnel serving in or with those armed forces are paid by the Australian Government. In relation to Australians serving in or with any forces other than government armed forces in Papua New Guinea, if such data on (a), (c), (d) and (e) was available, it would not be disclosed on the basis that it might prejudice investigations of criminal offences. No persons serving in or with forces other than government armed forces in Papua New Guinea are paid by the Australian Government.</PARA>
<PARA><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7251"></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5)(a) The Government's authority to restrict such actions is dependent upon the provisions of Australian law. The Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act 1978 restricts service by Australians, whether mercenaries or not, in non-government armed forces in foreign countries. As outlined in the answer to (2), service by Australians in or with the armed forces of the governments of foreign States is not contrary to Australian law. The Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act also restricts the recruitment in Australia of persons, whether mercenaries or not, to serve in any foreign armed force. Prosecutions are conducted under the Act as offences come to notice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) The Act includes certain offences in relation to Australians engaging in hostile activities in foreign states. As outlined above, prosecutions are conducted under the Act as offences come to notice.</PARA></ANSWER></ANSWER.TO.QON></ANSWERS.TO.QUESTIONS></HANSARD>
