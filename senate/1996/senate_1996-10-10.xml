<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EU4">Senator O'CHEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam President, on 27 June 1996 I reported on action by the Regulations and Ordinances Committee in respect of certain instruments made under the Native Title Act. The committee had ascertained that an important legislative determination made on Christmas Eve 1993, the very day that the Native Title Act received royal assent, was never tabled and so ceased to have effect 15 sitting days later. The committee was alerted to the failure to table when a subsequent determination, made some two years later, purported to amend the earlier determination. After the committee notified the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet of the, by now, more than two years invalidity, a fresh determination was made, gazetted and tabled, all on the same day. That fresh determination, however, could legally only operate from that date and could not validate any action taken in putative reliance on the earlier determination. Any such action taken during that period of more than two years was, of course, totally void.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I reported to the Senate earlier, I advised that the committee would continue to inquire into this matter. The committee then wrote to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) about the practical effects of the invalidity and of the steps proposed to remedy the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3855"> situation. We have now received the minister's reply, which illustrates the need to comply with the statutory requirements for tabling delegated legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The invalid determination provided for mandatory action in specified circumstances by the Commonwealth minister, the Commonwealth itself, the states and territories and the native title registrar. One of these circumstances was notification by governments of their intention to do a future act, such as grant a mining lease. In response to the committee's inquiry, the minister advised that there may have been thousands of these actions, all of which were totally invalid. Another circumstance concerned applications for determinations of native title, in respect of which the minister advised the committee that there were hundreds of invalid actions. Another aspect of the invalidity related to actions by state and territory agencies, the minister advising the committee that there was little likelihood that the range and extent of these could easily, if ever, be ascertained. This result is scarcely a flattering picture of Commonwealth public administration, with thousands of invalid actions, some of which date back more than two years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The minister also advised the committee that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) had asked the state and territory governments for their preferred option to correct the situation. As a result of these consultations, the proposed amendments provided for by the Native Title Amendment Bill 1996 would include a provision to validate retrospectivity of all of these thousands of actions. The committee in this case will not oppose such amendments, if only because to do otherwise would result in the considerable financial expenditure in this area over the last two years being wasted, and because of the waste of time if the whole process had to start again. Moreover, it would adversely affect thousands of people who had acted in the honestly held but incorrect belief that their actions were valid. The committee nonetheless has substantial reservations about the Commonwealth legislation providing for prejudicial retrospectivity. The minister did not expressly advise that the retrospectivity would be prejudicial but, if it was not prejudi cial, the problem could be corrected by delegated legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the Acts Interpretation Act legislative instruments may operate retrospectively only if nobody apart from the Commonwealth is adversely affected. The final outcome, therefore, is that thousands of ineffective actions will be validated years later by prejudicially retrospective provisions of a Commonwealth act. This is an unfortunate result but one which, as I say, cannot be avoided without much time and money being wasted. The committee was assisted in this matter by the prompt actions of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Senator Herron, for which the committee is grateful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Winston Churchill is said to have remarked that when he was told that a battleship was being launched he did not ask whether it had a bottom. In the present case, on behalf of the Senate, the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances asked whether the native title battleship had a bottom. In this case, it did not.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;This matter concerns a states grants bill regarding schools. This bill involves the expenditure of some $14 billion. This is a measure that the government has only recently introduced into the House of Representatives and involves a very substantial change in policy&mdash;the most radical change in policy that this country has seen for schools in 30 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I sought through the Selection of Bills Committee to have this matter referred to the Senate Education, Employment and Training Legislation Committee with a reporting date of 28 November. Given the sitting times that are already set down and the fact that we have a number of estimates days already reserved, that will leave very few days free for the committee to hear evidence and to consider this very important bill. As a consequence, I sought to have a reporting date of 28 November.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Frankly, in my opinion the committee cannot realistically report on the sitting date of 28 October.

This is an interim measure, pending government consideration of a comprehensive regulatory framework for on&hyphen;line services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current directions power in section 171 of the act provides some scope for the ABA to be directed to investigate the regulation of matters that the act does not cover. However, generally speaking, such investigations must be incidental to the operation or administration of the current act. In relation to services not covered by the act, such as on&hyphen;line services, this limits the role of the ABA to making recommendations about provisions that the act should make for those services, as it did in its June 1996 report Investigation into the content of on&hyphen;line services. The act does not authorise a broader ABA investigation, in consultation with industry, into matters that might be included in codes of practice as part of a future regulatory regime.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consistent with its election policy commitment, Australia On&hyphen;line, the government proposes to introduce a regulatory framework for the on&hyphen;line industry incorporating codes of practice, supervised by the ABA. The proposed new directions power will allow the minister to direct the ABA to investigate suitable codes of practice, pending the development of legislation implementing the government's policy.</PARA>

In particular, the minister will be able to direct the ABA to investigate any matter relating to the future regulation or operation of telecommunications services, including on&hyphen;line services.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Following Senator Sherry's amended motion this morning, I just want to make a short statement basically to say that my interests are on the public record in the Senate register, and they have been so since the inception of that register. As parliamentary secretary, I have complied with the guide of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), and I have given a detailed register of my interests to the Prime Minister. Within the Treasury portfolio I am responsible for administrative matters, particularly with regard to Corporations Law, the Australian Securities Commission and, to some extent, the Bureau of Statistics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not make decisions on policy matters&mdash;that is for the Treasurer (Mr Costello). The Corporations Law covers all companies: that is, nearly a million private companies, public companies, listed companies and collective investments. I do not deal with individual company matters. I can assure the Senate that I have had no conflict of interest during the last six months, nor do I expect one to occur. But, if a potential conflict did arise, then I assure the Senate that I would follow proper procedure: that is, not deal with the matter and pass the matter back to the Treasurer. I am not involved in banking. With regard to the family trust, I have disclosed full details of the two family trusts to the Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senator SHERRY</EMPHASIS> (Tasmania&mdash;Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3863"> (10.01 a.m.)&mdash;by leave&mdash;Firstly, in respect of the agreed variation to the motion: yes, pending the explanations to the Senate by the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Short) and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator Gibson), we had agreed to put in the words `of what could be construed as a conflict of interest'. Having heard the explanations of Senator Short and Senator Gibson, I now directly say to both those individuals that they do have a clear conflict of interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By Senator Short's admission today that he is going to sell his shares in ANZ, he is admitting that, for the past six months, there has been a direct conflict of interest. If we firstly go to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Guide to key elements of ministerial responsibility</EMPHASIS> which was published in April this year by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), there are two key elements to the document. The first element I want to refer to is on page 10, and it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ministers must be honest in their public dealings and should not intentionally mislead the parliament or the public. Any misconception caused inadvertently should be corrected at the earliest opportunity. Ministers are required to divest themselves of all shares and similar interests in any company or business involved in the area of their portfolio responsibilities. The transfer of interests to a family member or to a nominee or a trust is not an acceptable form of divestment.</PARA>
<PARA>This code of ministerial responsibility was set down by the Prime Minister shortly after the election. It is now seven months since the election and just over six months since Senator Short became Assistant Treasurer and Senator Gibson became Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These two senators are the persons responsible on behalf of the Liberal government for handling economic matters in this chamber, but their duties obviously extend far beyond that. I would like to refer to a press release from the Treasurer that outlines the responsibilities of both the Assistant Treasurer and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer. In the case of Senator Short, I specifically refer to issues relating to insurance and superannuation. The press release details his responsibilities in this area. In respect of Senator Short's responsibilities, point 6 refers directly to the administration of the banking laws. In <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the case of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, there is a range of duties outlined in respect of companies and securities and cheques and bills of exchange. A range of other representational duties is also outlined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, in addition to the direct responsibilities that they have, Senator Short sits in the ERC and, on occasion, he attends cabinet meetings. I am sure that there are numerous copies of Treasury and Department of Finance briefings that cross the desk of both Senator Short as Assistant Treasurer and Senator Gibson as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer. They have a detailed knowledge of the economic planning and management of this government. They have a highly detailed knowledge of what goes on in relation to economic decision making in respect of the Liberal government, and obviously in respect of the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of the shareholdings involving banks&mdash;in Senator Short's case, the ANZ Bank; in Senator Gibson's case, the National Australia Bank and the Bank of Melbourne&mdash;there is no doubt that there is a direct conflict of interest in those areas. But I submit to the Senate that, if we look at the shareholdings of both senators, and they are very wide&hyphen;ranging shareholdings, it is not just banks we are talking about. If we look at Senator Short's shareholdings, BHP, CRA, CSR, Boral, Pasminco, Jennings Industries, Centroproperties, MIRVAC, AGL, Cornwall Resources, Valero Energy and Parkwick Pty Ltd are shares directly owned and directly controlled by the Assistant Treasurer. For Senator Short's information, he has not corrected his entry in the register of interests: Bridge Oil ceased to trade two years ago. If we look at Senator Gibson's shareholdings, he has shares in the Bank of Melbourne, the National Australia Bank&mdash;he has not said whether he is going to sell those shares; he has not said anything about that today in the Senate&mdash;Woolworths, CRA, AGL, Amcor, BHP, BTR, Boral, Brambles, CSR, F.H. Faulding, National Foods and Simsmetal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I put it to the Senate that, in view of the duties and responsibilities of these two senators, there is a massive conflict of interest. There is a massive conflict of interest in them <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3864"> continuing to own and exercise authority over these shareholdings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we look at the interests of other senators, ministers and parliamentary secretaries in the register of senators' interests, no such conflict of interest exists that we can find in respect to any other ministers or parliamentary secretaries. Senator Parer, for example, had direct shareholdings in a mining company which he disposed of. He did the right thing, but not Senator Short and Senator Gibson. Senator Short has been caught out and today has admitted he has had to sell the shares in ANZ.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Short is directly involved in policy development with respect to banking. Why weren't these shares sold six months ago when he became a minister? That is when they should have been sold. I submit to the Senate that all the other shareholdings should have been sold six months ago because we have a Prime Minister, Mr Howard, who makes a great virtue of honesty and integrity in government. We now have a new document of ministerial responsibility. What you have done as minister and as parliamentary secretary is directly defied the Prime Minister's instruction which is very clear in this area&mdash;you are required to divest yourselves of shares and similar interests in any company or business. You have failed to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Your other ministerial and parliamentary secretary colleagues in this place have done so. Why haven't you? You are involved in direct decision making in respect of banking matters that affect the share price of ANZ. We will check the share price and see how well you have done as a consequence of announcing today that you are selling your ANZ shares. We will check that share price&mdash;six months too late!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On behalf of the Labor opposition, we highlight this issue in the Senate today. This is not the first mistake Senator Short has made in this place in the last six months. Senator Short cannot answer questions in question time; he cannot even answer questions from his own side. He has already had to apologise for misleading the Senate about <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sales tax legislation that arose from the Premiers Conference.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak briefly to that report. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>Essentially, this bill provides for the repeal of sections 25A and 25B of the 1988 act. These sections enable the Commonwealth minister under the so-called SOS program, the student organisation support program, to provide funds for student organisations in states that have passed legislation relating to voluntary student unionism and prohibiting universities from levying compulsory student membership fees. The sections also enable the Commonwealth to recoup from the states the Commonwealth funds given to student unions. Over $14&half; million of taxpayers' money has been redirected to student organisations under these arrangements by the previous Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee agrees that student associations are an important element of tertiary education experiences and, where these associations are valued by students, they will enjoy student support. For example, at the University of the Melbourne, since the Victorian government has enacted legislation on voluntary student unionism, 85 per cent of the student bodies are members of the student association. We note, however, that similar support is not forthcoming from students at the University of Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the committee's view, the matter of funding for student organisations is one that must be resolved between the universities themselves and their state governments. It is not appropriate for the Commonwealth to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3867"> intervene where the states' jurisdictions over their universities are very clearly defined. The Commonwealth should not legislate to undermine or to prevent the states from exercising their properly constituted responsibilities for the universities. The SOS program is an example of this and should be removed from the Commonwealth statutes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another difficulty relating to the SOS program concerned the issue of ministerial discretion in determining the level of Commonwealth funds payable to student organisations under the SOS program. We have already seen the Victorian government take action in the courts against the Commonwealth, alleging that the funds approved by the Commonwealth minister for payment to certain student organisations were in excess of what was lawful under the federal legislation. The Victorian government was also concerned about the inadequacy of the consultative mechanisms between the Commonwealth and the state in determining the appropriate level of payment to these unions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems, therefore, that the legislation under which the student organisation support program has operated is both problematic in principle and in its implementation. Not only does it intervene in an area of university operation which is the jurisdictional preserve of the state government, but the manner of its operation, in particular the way in which ministerial discretion is exercised, is substantially flawed. In the committee's view, sections 25A and 25B of the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 should be repealed. The committee  recommends that the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996 be passed without amendment. I commend the report to the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<STATE> (Victoria)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(10.24 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to the motion to take note of the report and to draw the Senate's attention to the minority report presented on behalf of Labor and Democrat senators. The concerns we have with this proposal are that, essentially, it is motivated by a vindictive desire by this government to settle old scores which arose as a result of disputes within student unions a few years ago when the present Treasurer (Mr Costello) and senior members <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the Liberal Party in Victoria got themselves involved in some disputes within student unions in that state. We have seen attitudes similar to that being expressed in Western Australia as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor senators take the view that student organisations are a crucial element of tertiary education and that they have a formal and statutory role to play in representing students of the universities on boards, in councils and in various other representative forums. To that extent, they should not be subject to unreasonable constraint in the exercise of their responsibilities or in the delivery of a wide range of services to students. We share the views of the executive director of the AVCC in that student organisations represent an important part of the educational experience and the learning culture, and all students should be able to and should participate in them, if they so desire.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen that states, particularly reactionary governments in Victoria and Western Australia, have undertaken legislation to prevent universities from levying fees for student organisations. In so doing, in my view they are interfering with a university's right to decide on what conditions of enrolments in the institutions should be. They are deciding that on an unjust basis; that is, on the vindictive basis that because a few senior politicians in the Liberal Party lost out in political battles in the universities in their youth others should bear the cost of that. Those states that pull the funding plug are denying students access to a whole range of services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under state legislation, students are required to participate on a variety of university management committees and councils, yet universities are not allowed to levy fees to fund the student organisations, required by statute to represent students on those councils. The Commonwealth, in my judgement, has a responsibility to monitor the running of universities, especially given the huge funding commitment made by the Commonwealth to Australian universities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where situations arise which diminish the effectiveness or the quality of Australian universities, the Commonwealth has both a right and an obligation to seek to remedy <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3868"> those situations and to protect those student bodies from the vindictive actions of the Liberal Party. The threat to student organisations, including the possible demise of some, clearly diminishes the effectiveness and the quality of the education received by tertiary students. It puts at risk the standing of our universities amongst international students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth has an obligation to provide protection and to ensure that such acts mitigate against the worst effects of such threats. That is why the Commonwealth SOS program was introduced. In my judgment it was right to do so and it is right now to maintain that provision within the act, to ensure that ministers have the capacity to provide assistance to student organisations so that there can be a proper functioning of student representation within our universities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sections 25A and 25B of the current act should remain. Even if this government does not have the courage to protect representative democracy in universities, the provisions should be available so the discretion is there for future ministers. That is the position that is clearly in the interests of the Commonwealth&mdash;to ensure that the quality and standing of our universities is maintained. This government is once again abrogating its responsibilities of national leadership to protect our universities and educational institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Billions of taxpayer dollars are spent on universities in this country, funded by this parliament. Yet we have the legal fiction presented by petty state politicians that universities are state institutions. It is a legal fiction. The Commonwealth funds these institutions to an extraordinary degree. Public funding going into universities in this country is well in excess of 95 per cent and comes as a result of the actions of this parliament. It is an extraordinary proposition for this government to say that these are state institutions and that, as a consequence, the petty actions of provincial politicians should override and should allow this vindictive matter to be followed through.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have very deep involvements in state politics, but I say to Senator O'Chee that we do not have these sorts of actions taken by the Liberal Party in Victoria, by Mr Kroger's agents and Mr Costello's agents. There we have seen time and time again the failed actions undertaken by that government to try to intimidate and destroy representation and prevent people from freely expressing their views within that state. We have seen the Victorian government try time and time again to intimidate and prevent people from making a proper representation of points of view that happen to be different from those of the Kennett government. That is a position this parliament ought to make a stand on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as I am concerned, the state governments are seeking to threaten a group of intelligent young people and are seeking to prevent them from enjoying the full range of the educational experience which is fundamental to university culture. They are trying to do it in such a way so as to ensure stifled debate and to prevent criticism emerging within those bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not as though they are opposed to compulsion. It is not an issue about compulsion because a whole series of fees are levied upon students compulsorily. They do not object to those, but they are opposed to the involvement of student unions on the various campuses within the states of Victoria and Western Australia. They are opposed to political representation on those councils and the use of student funds to allow for the adequate and effective representations of students within those councils.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the Victorian government has outlined compulsory membership of student associations, it has nonetheless provided for the collection by universities of compulsory fees for a range of 16 specified services. It seems that the principle of compulsion is not in itself the motive for the Victorian legislation but rather a specific instance&mdash;namely, the compulsion to join a student organisation as a condition of student enrolment. This instance is what we suggest is wrong with this provision. It goes to the very heart of whether or not this government has a commitment to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3869"> robust democratic processes and why it is so reluctant to accept the criticism of the student bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the committee we heard the submissions from the University of Western Australia. The Western Australian Student Guild revealed that, quite clearly, the Western Australian university continues to be unable to levy compulsory amenity fees and, if the SOS program is withdrawn, the guild will become bankrupt and cease to function unless the university undertakes a rescue mission to support the essential student services. That move would entail a total financial commitment by the university of some $345,000 per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the dramatic reductions in university operating grants, and the enormous cuts to higher education spending within the present budgetary arrangements, university resources of that magnitude are not available and will impact very severely upon the university's core functions. This is a matter which this parliament will have to consider in some detail. It will require considerable debate within this chamber to ensure that this government provides for the option in the future of allowing for effective student representation and of allowing for the funding, if necessary, through the SOS program to be maintained.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(10.34 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on the same matter as a member of the Senate Employment, Education and Training Legislation Committee. I wish Senate O'Chee had provided those views to the committee because we had a very fulfilling and satisfying day of hearings, to which Senator Carr has already referred. Eight submissions were presented to us on that day and all the people, including those people representing various bureaucracies and departments in Western Australia and Victoria, expressed their regret that the Commonwealth or the state governments had found it necessary to interfere with the workings of student organisations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make the point that the term `union' is quite a misnomer in this case. It is something that was repeatedly referred to by witnesses on the day. It was also pointed out by the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee that student unions or student associations, as they are more appropriately called, have been around for centuries. They are a tradition of university and campus life, but they are not akin to trade unions and formal trade unions as such. In fact, student unions, guilds or associations&mdash;whatever we choose to call them&mdash;are more akin to a community, council or shire.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to take up a couple of points that have been raised in this debate. The point of choice is not about compulsion; it is about universal membership of a student organisation, as the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee agreed. The members of the Australian Vice&hyphen;Chancellors Committee are hardly a radical bunch of people, but they were amongst the strongest defenders of universal membership of student organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They made the very clear point that, if a student chooses to enrol, the point of choice is at enrolment. It is at that point which they contribute fees to the student organisation which assists those people Senator O'Chee was referring to&mdash;those people who are perhaps from lower socioeconomic backgrounds who are more disadvantaged on campus, those people who benefit from the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3870"> types of services and facilities that are provided by a student organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats believe, along with many of the witnesses&mdash;including the National Union of Students, the Council of Australian Postgraduate Associations and the Australian Vice&hyphen;Chancellors Committee&mdash;that student organisations are a vital part of campus life. They provide a range of services such as subsidised catering, recreation facilities, meeting rooms, sporting clubs, student newspapers or even representation, which seems to be the major sticking point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That point seems to be why we have seen this attempt by certain state governments to emasculate these services that student unions and student organisations provide. The evidence presented to us showed that that was the case. In Western Australia, for example, we have guilds, as they are known there&mdash;student organisations&mdash;that are close to closing because they cannot afford to sustain and maintain their activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Carr made the point that there may be a political motive to the actions of various state governments and, indeed, now the federal government.</PARA>

As many senators may know, Victorian legislation operates somewhat differently but still attacks those services that we are referring to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In regard to the political point, I found the comments of the Executive Director of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, Mr Frank Hambly, interesting. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I probably should not say some of these things, but the reason this has happened is that some of the people who are now in parliament were students at the time when there were some unfortunate goings&hyphen;on in the national student body. They vowed that when they got into positions of influence they could do something about it, and they have.</PARA>
<PARA>I think the motive behind the higher education funding bill is quite a dubious one. It seeks to repeal sections 25A and 25B of the Higher Education Funding Act, which allow the Commonwealth to compensate those higher education institutions that have lost money as a result of state interference. It is an appropriate measure. It is one that the Democrats supported in 1992, 1993 and 1994 when the changes were made. We will continue to support it because, as I reiterate, we consider student organisations a vital part of campus life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The overwhelming evidence provided in submissions, both in public hearings and in written form, was that all those organisations in the know&mdash;those organisations that work with or understand students and student organisations on a daily basis, as well as Australian vice-chancellors and administrators of universities&mdash;believed that it was regrettable that the government was considering this stance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To that effect, the Australian Democrats and opposition senators have provided a dissenting report which recommends that the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996 not be passed by the Senate, but also offers a constructive recommendation in the form of urging the federal government to develop a more coherent approach. Even if those opposite believe strongly in the concept of so-called voluntary student unionism, at least you should seek to develop some kind of uniform standards. We have institutions in WA operating under a so-called process of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3871"> VSU, but operating completely different from student organisations in Victoria. At least the Commonwealth minister, in liaison perhaps with the state ministers, could work out some uniform standard so that students, especially those seeking to move interstate, are not faced with different and draconian principles and laws wherever they go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final point I choose to make, because the Australian Democrats have provided an additional recommendation for a number of reasons, is that we strongly support the principle of conscientious objection.</PARA>

I thank her in particular and the secretariat for their involvement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also thank the people who made very thoughtful submissions. I must say that the committee found some of the evidence that we were given exciting. It would have been wonderful to share that with the rest of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3873"> Australian community. Some of the work that has been done, especially in rural areas of Australia, is nothing short of a miracle. It was world&hyphen;first stuff. It was an enormous privilege for us to hear from those people first&hyphen;hand. I commend the report to the Senate. I seek leave to incorporate my tabling statement in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> and to continue my remarks later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The statement read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I take pleasure in tabling the report of the inquiry by the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts Committee into the Natural Heritage Trust Bill 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill was referred to my committee on 25 June 1996 by the Selection of Bills Committee. The reference was unusual in that it was referred by the Government for consideration rather than the Opposition. This is because the Government wished to obtain the views of the community, environment groups, landcare groups and other interested parties on the structure and objectives of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I feel that the committee has been very successful in obtaining a broad range of views and information which should assist the Government to further prepare this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I must say that the level of co-operation between the members of this committee and from interested groups has been remarkable. I have had the pleasure of meeting many talented and highly committed people determined to ensure that our environment is repaired, restored and maintained in a sustainable way for future generations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It bodes well for the environment if we on the committee with our different political colours can get together and rationally discuss these vitally important issues and that there are people out there willing and able to achieve success&mdash;as one submission said&mdash;we can forget our petty turf fighting and get on with the job.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee certainly came to the view that the public is waiting for action from this bill. It has the potential to provide the vehicle for historic environmental action and with funding of the magnitude planned, care must be taken to get it right.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the bill is to establish the Natural Heritage Trust of AustraIia Reserve. The main objective of the Reserve is to `repair and replenish Australia's natural capital infrastructure' and `money in the Reserve will be spent on the environment, sustainable agriculture and natural resources management.'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The initiatives covered by the bill include: Vegetation, rivers, Biodiversity, Landcare and Coasts and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Clean Seas. A major part of the Trust centres on five capital projects:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the National Vegetation Initiative</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the Murray-Darling 2001 Project</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the National Reserve System</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">  the National Land and Water Resources Audit</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> and the Coasts and Clean Seas Initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The major source of funds for the Reserve will be $1 billion from the partial privatisation of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee could not agree on the source of funds. Opposition and Democrat Senators wanted the funding to come from Consolidated Revenue. Government Senators were of the opinion that given the level of National Debt that it was necessary to use an alternate source of funding. Recognising this fundamental disagreement, the committee decided to concentrate on the issues arising from the bill as drafted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Therefore I believe the committee has come up with some very important and well considered views on the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After receiving 99 submissions and 6 public hearings the committee concluded that a good deal of confusion and suspicion had been created by the use of the words `Board' and `Trust' in the bill, because of the way the public perceives the operation of private trusts. The committee therefore recommends that these either be changed or greater explanation be given in the bill of the parliamentary accountability arrangements and the roles of various ministers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A good deal of the committee's time was taken up with consideration of advisory structures for the Board&mdash;ensuring representativeness without the creation of an unwieldy body or adding unnecessarily to the plethora of advisory committees already in place. After much consideration the committee recommends:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> that the two Ministers responsible for the Environment and Primary Industries Portfolios comprise the two-person Board;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">that the Minister responsible for the Environment Portfolio be the Chair of that Board;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> that an Advisory Panel- consisting of about 8 experts be established to advise the Board and assess proposals for funding;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> as far as possible, and if appropriate, the existing specific purpose advisory councils should be retained and be a source of advice to the Panel if necessary;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> however, Departments should take this opportunity to examine these and other advisory structures, to streamline them and to ensure that duplication is avoided; <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3874"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> that the Departments should, as a matter of urgency, streamline their administrative processes and co-ordinate with other funding <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> organisations (such as State/Territory Departments) to simplify the funding/submission process and ensure that any system is flexible enough to address unforeseen changes in priorities and methods; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> that the bill should included a reference to the type of advisory structures which will be put in place by the Departments and their roles and responsibilities and that separate regulations should contain the role of the Advisory Panel, the tenure of the members etc.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many witnesses and submissions raised the issue of the various roles of the two responsible Departments&mdash;Environment, Sport and Territories and Primary Industries and Energy. Some were concerned that Primary Industries would dominate the Environment Portfolio, others saw advantage in finally ensuring a closer relationship. Whilst the Departments allayed many concerns by assuring the committee that the Environment Department would be the `lead' Department, the committee felt that the bill should explicitly state that the Minister responsible for the Environment Portfolio is Chair of the Board and that the Environment Department has primacy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With respect to the scope of the bill's initiatives, the committee felt that there was potential for the bill to be inflexible to changes in priorities and needs if specific projects were outlined. Rather, it felt that the bill should include broad goals and objectives in the environmental areas Vegetation, Rivers, Biodiversity, Landcare, Coasts and Clean Seas and Atmospheric Issues. Further, the committee considered that the bill should be flexible enough to include, exotic pests, feral animals and weeds, international treaties on the environment and-education and training of the public landowners and users.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of submissions and witnesses drew the committee's attention to Australia's built heritage. The committee recommends that the Government address funding for Australia's Built Heritage as a matter of priority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee was concerned about the intention to attract gifts and bequests of money to the Trust Fund. The concern was two-fold in that the funds would have to be kept separate from the Trust and managed in a highly visible way since a Government funding mechanism may not be appropriate for these sorts of funds. Further, a number of organisations felt that their funding requirements from the public may be diminished by such a call from a Government fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee also recommends that to ensure that funds spent by the Commonwealth are effective and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not compromised by incompatible regulations and practices in the different States and Territories, that the bill include accountability arrangements for projects against measurable outcomes and that the Commonwealth work actively toward ensuring uniform or complementary legislation throughout Australia in the environment field.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, the committee recommends a needs-based approach to funding rather than any arbitrary per capital or regional allocation system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend this report to my colleagues in the Chamber with the hope that this bill will eventually be passed to the benefit of our environment and all Australians.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The thrust of the legislation that the committee has been looking at is inherently important and acceptable to a great number of the Australian community. The point that Senator Patterson makes about disagreement over the link with the sale of Telstra totally overrides the thrust of this legislation itself. The government is predicating the good works that may come out of the proposed legislation on a totally different, unrelated matter&mdash;their wish to privatise Telstra. We cannot get away from that nexus that the government has made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While ever it makes that nexus, it cannot claim that it is giving the environment the high consideration, the primary consideration, that the people of Australia repeatedly show they want through opinion polls and through their expression of concern for the environment in the going about of their day-to-day lives in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Patterson has commented on the near miraculous work being done in degraded areas of Australia by the good citizens. You have only to look at the Murray-Darling Basin to know what she is referring to. But at the same time, the same government is licensing the broadscale destruction of native forest ecosystems in the forested areas of Australia. So you have near miraculous repair work on the one hand but shameful, embarrassing environmental degradation being licensed by the government on the other hand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an enormous inconsistency here. One cannot help but think that the government simply wants to ride on a false chimera of environmental goodness while it goes <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3875"> about the business of licensing the destruction of world heritage value forests, rainforests, national estate listed forests&mdash;forests which ought to be national park in New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia, Tasmania and potentially now, because of the government's woodchip policy, Queensland. While this committee has been sitting and drawing up this report, the government at the same time has been giving the go-ahead to the Hinchinbrook tourist resort, the mega&hyphen;resort. This is totally inappropriate because of its impact on two World Heritage areas in central Queensland&mdash;namely, the Wet Tropics World Heritage area, and the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just yesterday on the eve of this report being brought into this place, we received news that the Minister for the Environment, Senator Hill, who is unfortunately not here at the moment, had been dictated to by Mr Williams, the man behind that resort, and had gone to water. Here we have the country's chief environmentalist who, as I have said, is not present in the chamber, simply being dictated to, taking his queue from a mega&hyphen;developer whose record on the environment is abhorrent; whose record, by the way, for respecting other people's points of view is abhorrent; and whose ability in endeavouring to quash other people's points I view is, I think, odious.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet we have that particular minister bringing forward this legislation trying to take kudos to cover up the fact that, beyond Hinchinbrook and forests, the government is also into a record expansion in uranium mining. It has legislation to come before this place to override Aboriginal sentiments on whether or not mines should go ahead on Aboriginal lands&mdash;and we know the Aboriginal people of this country have an extraordinary and unique record with their relationship to the environment and to the protection of the land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Everything is going negative, as far as the environment is concerned in this country, under this government, at a rate we have not seen in recent decades. This is a government of environmental villainy; it is a government of environmental destruction. It puts the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> environment way down the list. All it is interested in is the quick dollar. The mega&hyphen;developments get the nod. But the environment gets treated as some sort of patsy when this sort of legislation can be reported upon and a member of government can stand up and talk about near miraculous repair efforts. We will need more than miracles further down the line to repair the damage that is being done by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will cost future generations of Australians billions of dollars in trying to undo the damage being done to the forest environment, the wild environments around this country, the coastal environments&mdash;even the atmosphere we breathe in. This government is now notorious around the world for being at the back of the pack when it comes to trying to implement global measures to prevent the greenhouse gas phenomenon which is leading to global warming and to multi&hyphen;trillion dollar expenses, as action&mdash;which will be too late next century&mdash;is taken to try to prevent the world from getting into even greater economic, environmental and social disruption as a result of the impact of our carelessness. At this end of the 20th century you would expect a government, representing the people of Australia with their enormous environmental awareness, to be leading the world instead of coming from behind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3876"> The tragedy of this report is not what is in the report itself; it is what is behind it: the government treating the environment just as a patsy; the government paying lip-service to it; the government saying, `Yes, we'll do something about the environment, we'll give some funding to it'&mdash;and it is very modest funding at that&mdash;`provided we can sell off telecommunications in this country, provided we can sell off Telstra,' which is an entirely unrelated, unhitched subject to the environment. But what the government says is, `We are doctrinaire about selling off public utilities to the point that the environment has to take second string to that approach we have, which is that we want to put everything across to the private sector and divest ourselves of even the meagre powers that governments have these days in being able to try to rein in material ism and the impact it is having on the environment.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, I present report No. 346 entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Guarding the independence of the Auditor-General</EMPHASIS> . I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>Prior to the 1996 election, the Hon. John Howard, now Prime Minister, gave a commitment to the Australian people to establish a completely independent Auditor-General who would be an officer of the parliament as part of a broader strategy to restore authority, dignity and meaning to the parliamentary institutions. The existence of a strong and independent Auditor-General is absolutely fundamental for the effectiveness of parliament itself and its scrutiny of the executive government. Indeed, former Auditor-General John Taylor told the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in 1994 that he considered the question, `Who will control the Auditor-General?', to be one of the great battles between the parliament and the executive. It is a battle which has a long history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1902 the first Auditor&hyphen;General in his first report to the parliament stated that his office was inadequately resourced for the discharge of his audit functions. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts has reported to the parliament twice in the last decade on the desirability of strengthening the relationship between the parliament and the Auditor&hyphen;General.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In report No. 296, which was tabled in 1989, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, which also then I was a member of, informed the parliament that the Australian Audit Office, as it then was, was in a state of crisis, that it was under&hyphen;resourced and that a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> lot of problems stemmed from parliamentary complacency. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts also reported that there was confusion about whether the executive or the parliament was responsible for the Auditor&hyphen;General, with the result that the office was neglected by both.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In report No. 331, tabled in 1994, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts made a series of recommendations to amend the Auditor&hyphen;General Bill 1994 to enhance the functional independence of the Auditor&hyphen;General from the executive and to provide for greater parliamentary involvement in the performance of the audit function. Today, seven years on from the original JCPA report, the question of where the Auditor&hyphen;General fits in the framework of government still generates heated debate, as the committee discovered during its inquiry. However, the incumbent Auditor&hyphen;General, Mr Pat Barrett, was in no doubt that he considered parliament to be his employer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this report, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts has recommended that in the Auditor&hyphen;General Bill the Auditor&hyphen;General be declared an `independent officer of the parliament'. The title encapsulates the role and status of the office of the Auditor&hyphen;General. The Auditor&hyphen;General performs a function that is essential to parliamentary scrutiny but which the parliament itself has neither the technical expertise nor the resources to perform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While acknowledging that debate about the status of the Auditor&hyphen;General is essentially about symbolism, we believe that symbolism is important. To a very large degree, the way in which the position of the Auditor&hyphen;General is described influences public perceptions of the role and the significance of the office. It is important to note, however, that in the legislative model proposed by the JCPA the Auditor&hyphen;General would not be subject to direction by the parliament. I think the Clerk of the Senate would be pleased to note that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Joint Committee of Public Accounts has recommended that the guarantee of the Auditor&hyphen;General's audit independence be enshrined in the Auditor&hyphen;General Bill, putting it beyond doubt that the Auditor&hyphen;General has complete discretion in determining the audit <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3877"> program of the Australian National Audit Office and in deciding the manner in which audits shall be conducted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey), in referring this matter to the JCPA for inquiry, drew the committee's attention to concerns that the appointment of the Auditor&hyphen;General as an officer of the parliament could damage the independence of that office. The committee has reviewed the legal opinions obtained by the Australian National Audit Office on this issue. The committee is concerned that these legal opinions were obtained in a vacuum of policy advice about the intentions or will of the government and the parliament in appointing the Auditor&hyphen;General as an officer of the parliament. This is neither a criticism of the legal opinions or those who sought them, but it is the reason why some of the legal concerns raised in the inquiry are not relevant to what the JCPA is recommending in this particular report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee has attempted in this report to allay fears about the appointment of the Auditor&hyphen;General as an independent officer of the parliament, outlining in some detail what the JCPA means by the title and recommending provisions to be included in the Auditor&hyphen;General Bill to clarify the meaning and intended ramifications of this title. In the JCPA's legislative model for guaranteeing the independence of the Auditor&hyphen;General, both the position of the Auditor&hyphen;General and the Australian National Audit Office would be established as statutory offices for which the Prime Minister would take portfolio responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An important element of the new framework to underpin the independence of the Auditor&hyphen;General is the establishment of an Audit Committee of Parliament. The Audit Committee on behalf of the parliament would enhance the transparency of decisions taken in relation to the Auditor&hyphen;General. In particular, the Audit Committee would approve the appointment of the Auditor&hyphen;General, examine the proposed appropriations for the Australian National Audit Office and make recommendations to the parliament and to the executive on appropriate levels of resourcing. It would also monitor any executive directions to the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Auditor&hyphen;General, approve the appointment of the independent auditor and advise the independent auditor of parliament's audit priorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his letter of referral, the Minister for Finance confirmed his intention to seek cabinet agreement that the JCPA be given the functions of an audit committee. The JCPA is enthusiastic about the prospect of becoming the Audit Committee of Parliament. The Audit Committee functions are an integral part of the JCPA's existing broad role of reporting to the parliament on means of improving public accountability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this report the JCPA has also recommended a range of measures that would be incorporated into the new Auditor&hyphen;General Bill to support the functional independence of the Auditor&hyphen;General. The committee was flying blind, not having seen the Auditor&hyphen;General Bill 1996, and thus not being in a position to suggest specific amendments or additions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee has recommended that the Auditor&hyphen;General Bill provide for the Auditor&hyphen;General to have a mandate to conduct a full range of financial and performance audits across the entire public sector, including performance audits in government business enterprises. The committee has also recommended that the Auditor&hyphen;General Bill provide for the Auditor&hyphen;General to be appointed for a fixed term of 10 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will be apparent in this report that the JCPA considers the independence of the Auditor&hyphen;General to be absolutely fundamental to public accountability in Australia. If the Auditor&hyphen;General is not properly resourced or does not have the legislative mandate to carry out an effective and broad scrutiny of the public sector, then parliament itself is compromised in its ability to hold the executive to account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3878"> I commend this report to the parliament. I urge all senators to take an interest not only in this report but in the work of the Auditor&hyphen;General, whose future effectiveness will have a major impact on the effectiveness of parliament itself. This report contains a series of recommendations which pose a challenge to government. If adopted, these recommenda tions will go a long way to restoring authority and meaning to the parliament and securing the Auditor&hyphen;General's independence from the executive. It has taken seven years to get to where we are today, and I regard this as a hallmark decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I would like to thank my colleagues on the JCPA, all those who gave evidence to the inquiry, and the JCPA secretariat whose collective commitment to the task has enabled the committee to table this report within two months of receiving the reference as requested by the minister. In particular, I would like to thank the chairman of the committee, my colleague Mr Somlyay MP.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Kernot moving a motion relating to the conduct of the business of the Senate, namely a motion to give precedence to general business notice of motion No. 240.</PARA>
<PARA>I have cooperated with the minister to the nth degree on this matter and have tried to be as helpful as possible. I would have thought this would have been a very simple matter for him to agree to formality as we would have gone ahead with it. It is simply an extension of the cooperation that I have extended to him in seeking to get all of the documents which we need. That is why we believe this matter is urgent and needs to be debated today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a mystery to me why the minister has simply not agreed to formality. That would be the simple way to do it. I am sure he has nothing to hide but one does have to wonder when the cooperation that one extends to ministers is not reciprocated. In this case it has not been reciprocated. We have had to drag these documents out of the minister over a period of some weeks. I believe at this stage we should proceed with the suspension of standing orders. Once that is carried I will comment more in terms of the substantive motion.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to indicate that the opposition, for its part, will support this motion in the interests of greater transparency and accountability in government decision making. Not only is it the intention of the opposition to support the suspension of standing orders, but I indicate that the opposition will support the substantive motion that Senator Woodley will move. In the interests of ensuring that we do not spend too much of the Senate's time on this particular issue this morning I might indicate to the Senate why that is the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will hear from the government, I am sure, that it has tabled thousands of pages of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> documentation relating to this decision. I expect Senator Hill will say that during this debate. But it has withheld whole classes of documents which&mdash;surprise, surprise!&mdash;are the most sensitive documents and the most revealing documents. Senator Hill has given no justification for this action whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Hill tabled the second bundle of documents in the dead of the night on Tuesday without any at any stage having the courtesy to indicate to the opposition that that was his intention, particularly to me as the shadow minister representing the shadow minister for the environment&mdash;which I think Senator Hill would agree is poor form. When he did that in the middle of the night he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have not included legal advices, correspondence between colleagues, e-mails . . . internal memos and drafts.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Hill claimed that to produce all those documents would cost the government a further $40,000. I challenge Senator Hill to provide the basis for that calculation. Senator Hill went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have tried to use FOI principles as a guide, as was the practice of my predecessor.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the height of hypocrisy for someone who when in opposition argued long and hard, argued vociferously time and again, that those sorts of grounds do not apply to returns to order.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We really still have to hear an explanation of the blatant contradiction between Senator Hill's statement at estimates&mdash;confirmed this week at question time in this chamber&mdash;that he and he alone made the decision on the Port Hinchinbrook development on 22 August. The statements of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) a month earlier that the government had approved the project and that the Prime Minister had been personally involved were both downright lies. That is what the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) said at estimates and that is what he said in this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe it is appropriate that this very limited return to order for the production of documents should be supported by this chamber. I hope that some of these documents will shed some light&mdash;some light that you do not <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3880"> want to see, Senator Hill&mdash;on the continuing contradiction between what Senator Hill has said and what the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister have said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to say on behalf of the opposition that we do not intend to rest until we have nailed this matter down and nailed the responsible culprit, Senator Hill, who has not fulfilled his statutory responsibilities in this regard.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I said I was happy to do that to facilitate his other requirements. But really this debate is not about the merit of the motion at all; this debate is about whether there has been urgency demonstrated that would justify a suspension of standing orders so that this matter would take priority over all other matters on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> . Very little effort was made by Senator Woodley in his contribution to achieve that objective.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Just to make it absolutely clear again, even before there was any return to order passed in this chamber, I voluntarily tabled all of the key advices and documents in relation to consent I gave, in order to demonstrate transparency of government practice and, as I said at that time, in order for honourable senators to make a judgment on performance in relation to my obligations. I was more than happy to do it. I tabled it willingly. Some body else calculated that that was some 2,000-odd pages of material.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then, subsequently, a return to order was made asking for practically every document imaginable. It was a return to order put in the broadest of terms. That required, obviously, an enormous amount of work. As a result of that, at the first opportunity I was able to I tabled that material in the Senate during the adjournment debate the other night. Somebody has calculated that as being in the vicinity of 10,000 pages of material.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Still not satisfied, senators from the other side come in here seeking more. Furthermore&mdash;and this was not within Senator Woodley's return to order&mdash;I tabled the formal reasons for my decisions, which will be the subject of the current court litigation. That is worth remembering also because, although Senator Woodley says there is great urgency in relation to this matter, it is now in the courts and the courts in accordance with due process will no doubt take some time to resolve the matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the courts will pass judgment and the Senate has before it an enormous volume of material upon which to pass judgment. But on top of that, Senator Woodley comes in here today and says he needs another return to order and he needs it today&mdash;no reason why it cannot wait until next week and no reason why it cannot be debated in general business under the normal way. All of a sudden it has such enormous priority that it should be given precedence over all other business on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> of this Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no case that has been made out in these circumstances for that urgency. Interestingly, it does not even relate to documents within my control. It relates to documents alleged to be signed by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have thought that, at the very least, Senator Woodley would have given us the opportunity to discuss what was being sought with both of those two parties. That is why notice of motion is normally given and is subsequently debated after a reasonable period of time. But there was no such courtesy from Senator Woodley in this matter. He has <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3881"> thousands and thousands of pages of material on the public record already but, being dissatisfied with what he has got from me, he now wants to go after the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister as well, without making any case for that at all. He has no concern about what it has cost the people so far in dragging all these documents out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Faulkner asked where the $40,000 came from. My advice is that we have to search the bottom of the e-mail trail, the hard disk e-mail records, and that it would cost in the vicinity of $40,000. That is the advice I have been given. I have not calculated what it has cost the taxpayer to date to meet the requirements of Senator Woodley, but it has been a considerable sum of money as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, I tabled the documents as rapidly as I could and, therefore, it was impossible within that time to have them indexed. I have offered to the Senate, because I think the Senate officials are put in a very difficult position here, to have my department subsequently index those documents for them. We have bent over backwards to meet the requirements of Senator Woodley. No urgency has been made out, and this should be defeated. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<STATE> (Tasmania)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(11.24 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A very clear and cogent case exists for the urgency of this matter. Work is proceeding for the resort at Hinchinbrook that the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) has given the go ahead for. There has been an injunction holding up that work, but that injunction was lifted last week. Amid claims of environmental damage, the developer, Mr Williams&mdash;who has no record of environmental sensitivity which I would accept as legitimate&mdash;has begun what will end up being a very destructive process of establishing a completely unwarranted and untoward development in the region of the World Heritage areas of the Great Barrier Reef and the wet tropics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The minister says there is no urgency. That is because he is becoming a master of the pre-emptive. His delivery of the documents to Senator Woodley to the Senate at midnight the other night shows how sneaky the process can become when there is simple manoeuv ring going on by the minister to hide from the real debate, which is his abrogation of authority as chief environmentalist in this country when giving the go ahead for this destructive proposal on the Hinchinbrook Channel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He says that he withheld internal memos. I, for one, want to see them. I think everybody involved in this process wants to see them. He says there is transparency even though we cannot see. He has failed to respond properly to Senator Woodley's prior request for a return of all information to the Senate. He says that those internal memos are not our business, or are too hard to get or are going to cost money. They are sitting on his desk. He says he cannot get the e-mail or he has not got e-mail to provide us, which is a clear come on to anybody who wants to be secretive in the future to exchange information with Senator Hill's office by e-mail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the way you are going to be sheltered. He is going to hide that from those people in the public who want to know what this minister is doing when, on the one hand, he purports to be the Minister for the Environment and, on the other hand, he is saying, `Go ahead,' to Keith Williams. It would be nice if he would modify this destructive proposal. When Keith Williams says, `No, it's the mega-proposal or nothing,' the minister goes weak at the knees and says, `Let's have the mega-proposal.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Already we know that there has been further environmental damage at the site over the weekend. It is posited in all sorts of terms about what is minimal and acceptable and so on, but environmentalists on the scene reported damage to the mangroves by the removal of dead logs coming from previous destructive activities of Keith Williams and his bulldozers on this fragile site. The authorities themselves&mdash;and I mean by this the authorities under the protection of this minister&mdash;have reported that they had to remove plants for later replanting elsewhere, because they would have been destroyed by Mr Williams's activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So you cannot have it both ways. On the one hand, the destruction has begun under this minister's go ahead and, on the other hand, he says it is not urgent to give information to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3882"> Senator Woodley. What is he coming at? That is an insult to the Senate's intelligence. It is an insult to the people of Australia who are watching this issue and the people at Hinchinbrook, and in Queensland in particular, who are horrified by this mega-proposal, by this mega-developer who has caused such environmental crassness in his previous developments such as the one at Hamilton Island.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the matter is urgent. We are well aware that this minister, instead of standing up for the environment, is becoming a master at subterfuge and at doing everything he can to hide the facts which this Senate ought to be delivered with. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I oppose that motion. A number of matters have come before this chamber which have been outstanding for some considerable time. I voted for the suspension of standing orders because ultimately I believe that this matter ought to come before the chamber before it is due to come before the chamber&mdash;but not now. This particular motion is to have this matter take precedence over all of the other matters that are before the chamber and I do not agree with that. I agree that it ought to be dealt with today at some stage, but there are other matters that have been on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>  for a considerable period of time, not least of which are the disallowance motions put forward by Senator Bolkus.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We in this chamber have a number of responsibilities both within and outside the chamber and I believe that there should be some understanding by members of the opposition, by the Australian Democrats, by the Greens and by the government that these responsibilities require an enormous amount of time.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I was saying when I was interrupted last evening, if the opposition had not taken the stance that it had on these dramatic increases in court fees and charges, we would be abrogating our responsibilities as representatives of the public. Truly, what was proposed, and what still is proposed with the amendments Senator Vanstone foreshadowed last evening, is still draconian.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition is operating under some difficulties here today in addressing this matter. Some three weeks ago, after the estimates committee processes in detail when we addressed the reasons why these charges had been increased so dramatically, we put a series of questions on notice regarding the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> increases in fees to the High Court, the Family Court and the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition, and indeed the Senate, is being treated with disdain by the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) and the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department. We have not got responses to the questions that we put on notice to the Attorney-General and his department some three weeks ago. We have got somewhat of an explanation as to why we have not got answers and responses to questions by way of an undated letter from the Attorney-General to the chair of the committee, Senator Ellison. He writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Ellison</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am writing regarding the provision to the Committee of responses to questions taken on notice at the estimates hearings on 17 and 19 September 1996 for my portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You will be aware that an exceptionally large number of questions had to be taken on notice and that some of these questions are quite extensive and detailed. In addition, there was a considerable delay in the Hansard office placing the record of 19 September on the Parliamentary database for our access.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My Department and I will endeavour to provide the Committee with as many responses as possible by 4 October 1996&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>today it is 10 October 1996&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and I hope to be able to provide the remainder to the Committee by 9 October 1996. However, I must note that this may not be possible in every case given the detailed nature of some of the questions asked.</PARA>
<PARA>Here we are on 10 October 1996 and we have not got one response to one question that was placed on notice on these very important matters. I do not know what the intent of the Attorney-General is in doing this. I do not know why he should treat the Senate with such contempt. It is something that the Senate should address. It is certainly something that the members of the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee will be addressing when the Attorney-General's Department appears before it in two weeks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some difficulties&mdash;there is no question about it&mdash;because of the way the government has cut back the funds to Hansard. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> is not able to be delivered in the timely manner it used to be able to be <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3888"> delivered. Maybe that is a decided plot by the government to keep matters hidden from the committee as well. I notice that the chair of the committee is coming into the chamber. I suspect that he will continue his remarks on the legislation committee's report to this chamber on this very important matter. Information is being denied to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee met on 17 and 19 September, where we addressed questions to the Attorney-General's Department. Late on 19 September, and then on 25 September, the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs appeared before the committee. That department, which appeared two days later than the Attorney-General's Department, and in another case a week later than the Attorney-General's Department, has been able to supply the committee with responses to a large number of the questions that were placed on notice. But the Attorney-General's Department has not been able to do so. I suggest&mdash;I actually accuse&mdash;that this is a deliberate tactic by the government and the Attorney-General to keep information from the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Very early in the piece&mdash;on Tuesday, 17 September&mdash;we asked what modelling had been done in the High Court of Australia and in the other courts and tribunals in relation to the impact of the fees on the public and, indeed, on the work of the court. We asked for that. The secretary to the department took the question on notice. You cannot say that that is a highly detailed question that the government may take time to answer. That is something that a couple of officers of the department would probably have sat around with over a cup of coffee, maybe even with a cigarette in the barbecue area, and worked out some details and then provided it to the committee. It was a very simple request, but it has not been delivered. It is not one of the most important questions that the committee put on notice to the Attorney-General's Department. I am not suggesting for one minute that it is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The debate that is before the chamber is now occurring three weeks after the adjournment of the committee&mdash;actually, it is more than that because Senator Bolkus first started <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> debate on it this day three weeks ago, but it was on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> long before that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The information that we requested would be helpful to us in arguing this matter before the committee. The matter that we are arguing is not an inconsequential matter, despite what Senator Abetz said in his contribution to the debate last week. The matter in front of us has prompted the Law Council of Australia, one of the premier legal bodies in this country, to write to members and senators on at least three separate occasions in the lead in to the deliberations of the Senate estimates committee which took place last month. One of the letters that was addressed to the committee was incorporated into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> on Tuesday, 17 September. Page SLC48 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some idea of the impact of the fee increases in the Federal court may be ascertained by taking a typical case, say one in which a small company complains that a competitor is engaging in misleading and deceptive conduct. Under the old Schedule, the originating application would attract a filing fee of $368. That will now be $1,600, an increase of 335%. In the interlocutory stages, if (as is often the case) it is necessary to file a notice of motion, under the old Schedule the filing fee would be $62. That is now to be $246, an increase of 297%. When that notice of motion comes on for hearing, that would occur, under the old Schedule, without further fee. Under the new Schedule, that small company would need to pay $400 to the court for each half day (or part thereof) occupied. If this hypothetical case could not be settled, and had to be set down for hearing, under the old Schedule the applicant would then pay a "hearing fee" of $616. Under the new Schedule, that small company would now pay the sum of $2,000 for the privilege of having the matter set down for hearing, and this sum is no longer described as a "hearing fee". The new "hearing fee" is now a fee which accrues at the rate of $1100 per day . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Truly, these proposed fee increases are dramatic and, indeed, draconian. To the best of my knowledge, I have never stood up in this place and been a defender of the Law Council of Australia. I have actually very rarely been a defender of the legal profession at all; I have usually left that task to my colleague Senator Cooney and some of the members on the other side of the chamber. Usually when I have had to speak about the legal profession it has been in a critical sense.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3889">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But on this occasion, I am quite happy to be able to stand here and defend the proposition that they are putting forward. I have no doubt that there are some corporations in this county who can afford the new fees and, indeed, will probably thrive on the fact that the new fees are there. The new fees that are being introduced and proposed by the government, and, indeed, which are actually in action and have been since 1 September, will keep many companies and many individuals out of the court system. That in itself may be a good point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I ask you when considering that to consider the cost of justice. Should justice be available only to those who can afford to pay for it? If that is the case, we have turned over the whole of the judicial system that we have in this country. I do not think that we should do that, and we certainly should not do that without a dramatic debate on it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that the concept of user pays is something that pervaded the thoughts of many in the previous government and previous governments. It probably will pervade the thoughts of those in this government. It is worth while to read into the record what the Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, Justice Brennan&mdash;the most senior judge in this country&mdash;had to say in a recent speech on the matter of user pays. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With respect, that profoundly mistakes the constitutional function of the judicial power of the State which, as I have said, is to apply the rule of law in resolving disputes and thereby preserving the peace, order and good government of society.</PARA>
<PARA>The chief justice does not agree that the judicial system should be restricted only to those who can afford to enter into it. In the same speech, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The courts are overburdened, litigation is financially beyond the reach of practically everybody but the affluent, the corporate or the legally aided litigant&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I want to come back to the issue of the legally aided litigant shortly&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Governments are anxious to restrict expenditure on legal aid and the administration of justice. It is not an overstatement to say that the system of administering justice is in crisis. Ordinary people cannot afford to enforce their rights or litigate to protect <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> their immunities. To that extent, the cohesive force of the law is undermined.</PARA>
<PARA>They are very salutary words that ought to be digested by all in this chamber and, indeed, all who have anything to do with the legal and justice system in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not standing here as a member of the opposition who is opposed to fees being imposed on those who want to participate or have the need to participate and be involved in the judicial system. Indeed not. It would be hypocritical for me to do so. I know that when I sat on the other side of this chamber as a backbench member of government, I in turn supported the increases in fees that were levied on people and corporations who wanted to participate in the judicial system. I never, from that side of the chamber, participated in or supported actions that go to the extent that these actions go to. I doubt very much that I would have supported them. I do believe that they are truly draconian and should be opposed and dismissed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, we have increased fees in the past. We have from time to time imposed fees where no previous fees were in existence. But, if you take the words of the minister in her contribution to this debate yesterday and the words of Senator Abetz in his contribution, you will find that the levels of cost recovery of the administration of justice were not punitive under the previous regime. They certainly were not punitive in 1992 when the then Senator Sid Spindler proposed a disallowance of the fees&mdash;that proposal was supported by the now government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that Senator Abetz in his contribution yesterday saw fit to use a quote from the then minister for justice, Senator Tate, and to read it into the record. I would like to do the same thing and then prove a different point from the one Senator Abetz was trying to prove last evening. In March 1992, in a Senate debate on the matter of the disallowance of judicial fees, Senator Tate said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But, basically, the fees are being levied in order to assist the Federal Government to discharge its obligation to fund the system of justice, which we are obliged to do if our society is to remain one governed by the rule of law, and the contribution, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3890"> running into some millions of dollars, certainly would be very helpful in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA>It may well be that $500 for a hearing in the Federal Court of Australia when one is paying thousands of dollars a day for counsel is not an extravagant amount at all. It could well be increased to help defray the costs which were otherwise borne by the ordinary taxpayers of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Coalition senators, together with the Democrats, opposed that statement at that point in time. They opposed the proposal to increase fees when it was before the Senate chamber. The figure quoted is $500. With the fees that are being considered now, we are running into the tens of thousands of dollars. I ask coalition senators: if it was quite right and proper in 1992 to oppose the introduction of an increase in fees to the level of $500, is it not right and proper at this time to oppose the introduction of and increases in fees to many tens of thousands of dollars? I say it is. I am glad to have the opportunity to stand here and make that point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just while I am on Senator Abetz's contribution of last evening, I would make another point; it is the one which I said I would return to. In his opening contribution, he referred to Senator Stott Despoja's contribution to the debate and then raised the matter of applications relating to domestic violence. I do not disagree with where Senator Abetz said that domestic violence applications are filed. They are filed within state jurisdictions, generally speaking, around the country. Part of the reason for that being the case is that there is then the ability for people who are making applications for orders relating to domestic violence to be legally aided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the proposals of this government, the legal aid system that we enjoy in this country now will be emasculated. I would suggest that, if the attorney's proposals which restrict the use of Commonwealth funds for legal aid to Commonwealth matters only go ahead on 1 July next year, what we are witnessing now with the applications relating to domestic violence orders being filed mainly in state jurisdictions will indeed change; that people will want to file those applications in the Family Court of Australia&mdash;which, indeed, is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> part of the Federal Court of Australia. If that is the case, perhaps there is the need in that circumstance for them to be able to get legal aid to proceed with the filing of their applications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was pleased that Minister Vanstone, coming in here representing the Attorney&hyphen;General, did give some relief, as she promised she would three weeks ago, in her contribution last evening&mdash;some relief. I do not know what worth can be gained from that relief. However, going to the detail of what she said, in the first instance she talked about the Family Court and said&mdash;and I will use her words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To partially offset this reduction, the government has decided to make a small additional increase to the fee for principal relief. The current fee will rise from $460 to $500.</PARA>
<PARA>I now go back to the attorney's statement that he released at the delivery of the budget and bring this relief that the minister suggested last evening into some form of perspective. On 30 August this year the fee was actually $368 dollars, it was proposed in the budget to increase it to $460, and last evening the Minister representing the Attorney&hyphen;General announced that it will be increased further&mdash;to $500. That is wonderful relief for those people who are participating in the Family Court of Australia! Just over a month ago, to make an application cost $368. That was to be increased to $460. But last evening we were told it is now going to $500. There was an offset on it, and to do the minister justice I will continue on with what she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We propose to reduce the fee for ancillary relief from its current level of $250 to $150.</PARA>
<PARA>That, again, is welcomed for what it is worth. But it should be pointed out that on 30 August this year, just over a month ago, that actual fee was nil. To make an application for ancillary relief, it did not cost you anything in August of this year&mdash;or in July, or preceding 1 September when the new fee increases that were announced in the budget came into effect. So the minister last evening graciously has reduced from $250 the fee that was announced in the budget to $150.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will continue with Minister Vanstone's statement to the Senate last evening:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3891">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the high level of waiver in the Family Court and the reduction in the fee, we believe that such a fee should be well within the reach of those who do not fall into the approximately 40 per cent of those whose fees are waived. In addition&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the minister continues&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the government will reduce the one&hyphen;off hearing fee from $400 to $300 to reduce the impact of that fee.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, I welcome that for what it is worth. But it should be pointed out that, in August of this year or prior to 1 September, the fee that applied for the one&hyphen;off hearing was nil. We have gone from nil to $400 back to $300&mdash;nonetheless, it is a step in the right direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister last evening also announced some other decreases and changes that apply to the Federal Court. Then she stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be other reductions in fees in the Federal Court. The application fee for a non&hyphen;corporate litigant will be reduced from $800 to $500 and from $1,600 to $1,200 for a corporate litigant.</PARA>
<PARA>Previously there was no fee. So we accept the magnanimity of the statement of last evening! The minister then continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The daily hearing fees will be reduced from $550 and $1,100&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is $550 for an individual and $1,100 for a corporate entity&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to $400 and $800 respectively.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, great magnanimity! The minister, however, failed to point out what the fee was prior to 1 September of this year. There has been a reduction, certainly. But in the appendices attached to the attorney's statement, which I am quoting from now, that fee up to and including 30 August this year was nil. I suppose we do have to be grateful for small mercies&mdash;small  mercies, indeed! I think the Law Council of Australia, in writing and addressing letters on this matter to senators and members of the Australian parliament, did themselves and, indeed, the public of Australia a great service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that they are watching this debate with interest because it is of great concern to them&mdash;though not of concern to them in the sense that Senator Abetz raised last evening when he related these increases to the fees that lawyers charge. When I engaged in some of my attacks on the legal profession in the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> past, I did not do it on the basis of the fees that the individuals charged. If they can get them, fine; they can get them and get away with it. Had the legal profession and the Law Council of Australia and those other bodies sought to increase the fees of lawyers by 300 and 400 per cent, I would have stood here and condemned and attacked them&mdash;as Senator Cooney said a short while ago, viciously attacked them. I would indeed, and they would be deserving had we done so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think the Law Council of Australia has ever supported increases of the nature that is suggested and proposed&mdash;and indeed that have been implemented&mdash;by this government now. I do not think the Law Council of Australia have ever supported fees of that nature. I would hope that they will take account of what Senator Abetz said last evening and, in doing so, address their member, because he did admit in the debate last evening that indeed he is a member.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final point I want to make is that a great deal of store has been put in what the cost recovery is from state judicial jurisdictions as opposed to what it is from the federal jurisdictions. In the figures that were given, I do not know why 1989 was used. Had we more time in the debate, I think it would be worth while putting further questions&mdash;or perhaps I am flagging questions for the estimates committee proceedings in two weeks time&mdash;to get the cost recovery figures from each of the years, not just 1989.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The figures that the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, last evening quoted&mdash;and indeed they were quoted later by Senator Abetz&mdash;do not correlate with those figures that were provided to the senators and indeed incorporated in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> at page L&amp;C 49 on 17 September. They do not correlate at all. But we are not in a position to check because the questions that we put on notice have not yet been replied to. That is a matter that will be followed through in the Senate estimates committee. It will be followed through in this chamber as well because not only is that an insult to those members of the committee but also the Attorney's actions are an insult to the Senate. </PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9X5">Senator ELLISON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you. In relation to this whole question of the increased court fees, I would like to remind the opposition of its position in March 1992 when the then Minister for Justice, Senator Tate, stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the fees are being levied in order to assist the Federal Government to discharge its obligation to fund the system of justice, which we are obliged to do if our society is to remain one governed by the rule of law, and the contribution, running into some millions of dollars, certainly would be very helpful in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA>He was speaking in relation to a move by the then government to increase court fees. In fact, what he was saying there was that the increased court fees would be very helpful indeed in contributing to the expensive cost of our judicial system. It would be no surprise to the community at large to know that the Family Court alone costs in the region of $100 million a year to run. But it was this opposition, which was formerly in government, that sought to increase fees. Not only did it do that, but also the previous government looked at a fees review in 1992. It made a decision last year to continue with the increase in fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former government itself recognised the need to increase court fees. It recognised the need to have some sort of cost recovery in the running of our courts. In fact, as an average, the Commonwealth recovers about half of the costs that the states do. The states have a recovery rate in the region of 30 per cent. The Commonwealth, unfortunately, has a recovery rate of something in the region of 16 per cent. You have this situation where the judicial system in this country is expensive. By its very nature it is costly, and that is a fact of life. The government needs to have some recovery in relation to the running of those courts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course there has to be a safety net. There are people naturally who could not afford to pay the necessary fees. So there is a provision for the waiver of fees. In the Family Court&mdash;we were told this in the estimates committee&mdash;38 per cent of applicants have their fees waived. Not quite 40 per cent have their fees waived. So if you are receiving social security or legal aid, you do not have to pay the fee. That leaves some 60 <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3893"> per cent of litigants who then have to look at the fee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has listened to representations made to it and it has agreed that in relation to applications in the Family Court the fee will be reduced from $250 to $150. The one-off hearing fee of $400 will be reduced to $300. Let me make this point: in the Family Court only five per cent of matters go to trial; 95 per cent of matters settle. That means only a small sector of litigants will find it necessary to pay the hearing fee because most matters settle without going to trial. So in the family law jurisdiction these fees will not have such a drastic effect as the opposition would make out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the Federal Court, the Attorney has announced that the filing fee for corporations and  individuals respectively will not be as high as first proposed. For individuals it will now be $500 instead of $800. In relation to corporations, I understand the fee is coming down from $1,600 to $1,200. That affects the scenario that Senator McKiernan portrayed in relation to a small business engaged in a section 52 action which relates to misleading or deceptive conduct. He said that the filing fee would be $1,600. That is wrong because the government is now proposing it be $1,200. He said that the hearing fee would be $1,100 a day. That is now being reduced to $800 a day.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9X5">Senator ELLISON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And there is one day in court free&mdash;the first day. Senator Harradine is quite correct. So there were three aspects of the scenario that Senator McKiernan portrayed which were quite incorrect. I think it is important for the Senate to take note of that situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Importantly, the government has recognised the situation in relation to industrial relations matters. The situation there is that the filing fee will be reduced to be the same as fees in the Industrial Relations Commission. That is pertinent to unlawful dismissal matters where you would have an individual taking action against an employer.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another aspect that has been raised is the question of domestic violence and the use of restraining orders. Unfortunately, it is becoming a matter which is quite  prevalent in our community that people have to resort to these applications but they do not go to the Family Court. Senator Abetz was quite correct when he pointed out that 99 per cent of matters would go to the magistrates courts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why do people go there? Because the relief is more substantive and it is instantaneous. You can obtain your relief much more quickly in the magistrates courts than you can in the Family Court. So people do not go to the Family Court for restraining orders where there is an allegation of domestic violence. They go to the magistrates courts, and those courts are not affected at all by any of these proposals. For the purposes of this debate, the question of domestic violence is really quite irrelevant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to the proposals in relation to family law, I would point out that only form 7 applications attract a fee. Form 8 applications do not attract a fee. Form 8 applications are quite important during the course of an action because they can relate to such matters as urgent access. It may be that a party to a Family Court action is being denied access and they make an urgent application. That urgent application would not attract a filing fee. I believe it is quite appropriate that it not attract a filing fee as such. The initial fee is paid when a form 7 application is lodged and that is it. It is a one-off payment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has to address the budget deficit. This measure, as has been stated, would look at addressing that in part in relation to the judicial system. A figure of over $100 million was mentioned over the period of four years. That is a substantial amount. As I pointed out, the opposition when it was in government recognised what an important issue this was. In 1992, the opposition when it was in government&mdash;when Senator Bolkus was a minister in that government and when Senator McKiernan was a part of that government&mdash;tried to raise court fees. It tried to raise court fees because the cost of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3894"> administering the courts was becoming so burdensome on the taxpayer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also concede the point that even then the opposition recognised there should be a safety net, that people on legal aid should not have to pay the filing fee. We, too, with these proposals recognise that safety net. It is not a question of anyone who is in pecuniarius having to pay these fees because they can apply to have them waived. There is a form they can fill in and a means test can be applied. If they are on legal aid the fees are automatically waived. If they are on social security the fees are waived. These fees will not have as wide an application as the opposition would make out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that the question Senator McKiernan raises in relation to the civil action of a section 52 matter is incorrect. One point that should be made is that most of those sorts of actions would be conducted in state courts in any event. So that would not apply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I deny emphatically that there has been any conspiracy in relation to the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department to deny answers to the estimates committee. The department, I believe, cooperated fully with the estimates hearing which lasted some 18 hours, if I recall. There was some 18 hours of evidence and I believe the department was very good in the way it cooperated with the committee and in the answers it gave.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have put to the Senate the logistical situation that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> had a lot on its plate with estimates and, in relation to the questions on notice, the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department had to have those questions before it could answer them. It has answered the vast majority. The remainder will be answered shortly. There is no conspiracy and there is absolutely no fault on the part of the department. I reject emphatically any intention by the Attorney-General to obstruct the course of the estimates process.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It will be necessary to speak only to the first of these eight bills. The seven following bills currently before the Senate are consequential bills. They are part of a package and simply set the levy rates on the particular industries involved that are required to fund the Australian Animal Health Council itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Animal Health Council bill and the seven consequential bills are being introduced into the chamber at this particular time because they are non-controversial bills&mdash;that is, there is no disagreement on them. It does not mean that they are unimportant bills. I do want to draw the Senate's attention to the fact that we are passing very significant legislation today for Australia that is not just of relevance to Australia's primary industry. It is of major relevance to the national economy, to the national wellbeing of this country and to the environment of Australia in a broader sense.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3895">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had the great privilege&mdash;and, indeed, it is a great privilege&mdash;to be the minister who had the carriage of this legislation through ARMCANZ. I mention that simply to acknowledge the full&hyphen;blooded support the Commonwealth government received from the states and from all of the state ministers for primary industry, all of whom recognised the vital importance these bills constitute today for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is one of the great trading nations of the world. We are an island continent. With the level of trade increasing&mdash;and I hope it will continue to increase at an expediential rate every year&mdash;Australia needs to be prepared against an outbreak of an exotic animal disease which could absolutely devastate multibillion dollar industries for Australia not just in the immediate term or even in the medium term but in some cases in a way which might never be altogether successfully addressed. Those concerns can never be overstated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Animal Health Council, which this bill will give life to, is going to be the foremost national body&mdash;and it will be recognised internationally with that status&mdash;to stand between Australia and that prospect. It is also being set up to deal with day-to-day problems in respect of our pro&hyphen;active position on trade. I am talking here about problems such as chemical residue in the commodities that Australia produces into our all&hyphen;important export markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was absolutely essential that this national approach be taken. It was a complex matter. Many bureaucrats from both the Commonwealth and state bureaucracies cooperated fully over a long period of time in dealing with the whole range of complex issues that are normally there in this federation of ours to get the agreement necessary to put all of these things into place at both the federal level and the state and territory level. That level of cooperation was there and that is why we have got this legislation here today&mdash;the formal agreement being reached in ARMCANZ in August last year, from memory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing that needs to be noted that is also important is that the council subsumes <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the vitally important responsibilities of the body formerly known as EXANDIS&mdash;the Exotic Animal Disease Preparedness Consultative Council. The legislation that established EXANDIS lapsed in December last year. This body subsumes the responsibilities of EXANDIS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In its final annual report, EXANDIS urged all governments and industry to maintain through this body an extremely high level of continued activity at protecting Australia against the outbreaks of exotic diseases that I have just referred to.I want to pay tribute&mdash;as I am sure the government would pay tribute&mdash;to the work that was done by EXANDIS in assisting Australia to maintain those protections and in assisting in the formation of the body that we are giving birth to here today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth while pointing out because it is always a matter of topical discussion in this country&mdash;and so it should be&mdash;that, in the handover set of recommendations, if you like, contained in the final EXANDIS annual report, EXANDIS considered that foot&hyphen;and&hyphen;mouth disease, newcastle disease, blue tongue and classical swine fever remained the major potential exotic disease problems for this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, all these things will always be topical. Newcastle disease obviously is in the news right now as the major concern of the Australian chicken meat industry, as there is a proposal currently before us to import chicken meat from Thailand&mdash;a country, of course, in which newcastle disease is endemic. These will always be issues of topicality in a country such as ours that depends entirely, as we do, on the health of our trade for our national economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3896"> There are just a few things that were recommended by EXANDIS as well that I do want to simply draw attention to very briefly. One&mdash;and it is a matter that was brought to me on a number of occasions&mdash;was the concern that EXANDIS had about the recognised current deficiency in the epidemiological database in Australia, which is needed for a totally effective disease surveillance system in this country. It was a matter that was drawn to my attention on a number of occa sions by EXANDIS during its life. It took the trouble to note in its final annual report that this is a matter that should be of continuing concern for the body that we are launching here today&mdash;the AAHC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">EXANDIS also called upon the AAHC to continue the national disease&hyphen;watch hotline to facilitate reporting and investigation of any unusual animal incidents in all states and territories and to ensure that the necessary resources are made available for this service to continue. Again, I guess this is something that we are so conscious of in those areas of Australia that are so close to the countries where these diseases are endemic. Things like screw-worm fly&mdash;which, thank God, do not exist in Australia yet&mdash;are just hundreds of kilometres away from our shores. There is the never-ending potential for destructive pests such as screw-worm fly to enter Australia and cause consequent devastation to Australian industry. Of course, there is no need to canvass the never-ending potential for foot&hyphen;and&hyphen;mouth disease outbreaks to occur in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not simply luck that these diseases and pests have not arrived here. Luck has something to do with it. Luck always has something to do with it. It is, in fact&mdash;I am pleased to say&mdash;a high degree of management also that helps to prevent these diseases and pests from infesting our shores.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said earlier that this is not and cannot be considered to be an issue that simply affects primary industry or primary producers. The introduction of a disease like newcastle disease into Australia&mdash;a disease that EXANDIS rates among that handful of half a dozen diseases of the highest exotic disease concern to Australia&mdash;would have a devastating effect on the Australian environment at large. It is a disease which, if it ever got a foothold in Australia and got into the wild population of birds in Australia, would be almost impossible thereafter to ever eradicate; it would simply become part of our disease landscape as well as those of the countries that are close to our shores.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I say, and I will not need to speak again during this debate on the other seven bills, that this is extremely important legislation <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that we are passing through the Senate. I do want to once again express my thanks on behalf of the opposition to a very dedicated group of public servants and bureaucrats, at both state and federal level, that has worked extremely hard to see the implementation of the Australian Animal Health Council. It has a vitally important role to carry out for Australia, and I wish it well. I certainly pledge the complete support of the Australian Labor Party, the opposition in the Senate, in terms of its future operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will conclude on one small point of detail. There was some concern expressed, and there was some lack of certainty, about whether the Australian Animal Health Council would have to, or would be required to, report on its operations to the parliament through the estimates committee process. That matter has been resolved&mdash;certainly to my satisfaction. The answer to that particular question is yes, it will. The payments that are made to it&mdash;by this legislation, I might add&mdash;that constitute those levy collections do, in fact, provide the grounds for that reporting to be done. That is an important matter for all members of this parliament. They can be assured that the Australian Animal Health Council will, if it is required to do so, appear before Senate estimates committees to give reports on its progress.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first thing I need to do is indicate that I withdraw the amendments circulated in my name. The reason is that I had discussions with the parliamentary secretary last night, and I understand the necessity to have this legislation passed today. The Democrats certainly were not intending to put any spoke in that wheel by moving those amendments, and I will be seeking assurances from the minister in his reply, which I know he is going to give, that will answer many of the questions that we had. The last comment of Senator Bob Collins also goes to one of those questions, and perhaps part of the assurance that I was seeking has been given already.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are dealing with a number of bills which are listed on the notice paper, including the Australian Animal Health Council (Live&hyphen;stock Industries) Funding Bill 1996. The <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3897"> council is a new instrumentality, established during the time of the previous Labor government. It is not required to prepare an annual report which must be tabled in parliament and it is not subject to the Audit Act. So you can understand the concerns that the Democrats had and the reason originally for wanting to move an amendment to make sure that the reporting would in fact be done and that the scrutiny of the parliament, and particularly of the Senate, would be assured. The comment made by Senator Collins certainly points in that direction, and I am sure the minister will comment further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Exotic Animal Disease Preparedness Consultative Council ceased operations on 30 June 1995 and the proposed Australian Animal Health Council Ltd has been established as a non&hyphen;profit company limited by guarantee under the Corporations Law. The AAHC is jointly owned and funded by the Commonwealth government, state and territory governments and the peak national representative bodies of Australia's livestock based industries. The council's broad role is to ensure that the Australian animal health service system is capable of maintaining acceptable national animal health standards which will meet consumer needs and market requirements at home and overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not going to read all of the speech I had prepared for today because I do want to leave time for the minister to make comments, in line with the agreement I have with him. But I will just comment on a couple of the other bills which are before us and which raise issues about welfare for the live sheep and live cattle export trade in particular.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is all right, Senator Panizza&mdash;the minister and I have an agreement that we will have a very fruitful discussion about this. The issue of live sheep exports has returned to prominence recently with the death of over 67,000 sheep when the ship they were travelling on caught fire. I understand this generated a particularly strong response in Western Australia. A rally and march is occurring in Perth this Sunday, 13 October, which is meant to tie in with over <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> seas protests by the Compassion in World Farming Group. There is cruelty involved in the trade, from our perspective.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would remind the Senate that the Senate animal welfare committee's report on the issue some 10 years ago acknowledged as much, but said that economic and other factors had to be taken into consideration. I agree with that; there is always a balance in these things. The main thrust of that report was to encourage the development of an alternative carcase trade. This does not appear to happen to any great degree, and the government's focus seems to be very much on expanding the live animal trade.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the questions which I would like the minister to address are as follows. Does the government have a comment on that report of the former Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare? Would the government indicate whether or not it believes the recommendation of the committee that there should be an effort to phase out the live sheep trade in favour of the carcase trade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like the minister to indicate whether the AAHC will address animal welfare issues. The disease issues are absolutely critical, but I think there is a question there which the minister could comment on, and I would be happy to receive his answer. I realise that animal welfare is currently not in the AAHC's objectives, and perhaps the minister could give some indication of whether or not he believes they should be extended to include that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats would be interested to know whether, if the government were inclined to accept and take up the recommendations in the report some years ago of the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare, a differential in the levy between live sheep and carcase sheep would be an incentive for moving from live sheep trade to the carcase trade. The final question that the minister may be able to give me an answer on is whether or not it would be possible to use the levy to provide funds to pay for the presence of a vet on export ships. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have a bundle of eight bills before us, and I wish to speak principally to the Cattle Export Charges Amendment (AAHC) Bill 1996 and the Cattle Transaction Levy Amendment (AAHC) Bill 1996. I recognise the need for me to be brief. This is yet another levy being put on cattle producers, who have been going through a very hard time in recent years. Particularly in my state of Queensland, we are well into the sixth year of a major drought, the biggest in living memory, and we are facing a market collapse with respect to cattle prices. Anything that increases the costs of production is not viewed with favour in any way at all. But we recognise that there are some virtues in this if it is taken to the objectives that are stated in bringing the bill before the parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like first of all to declare my financial interest in this as a cattle producer. It is interesting to see from the statistics here in the parliament that, in the last four parliaments, between five and 10 per cent of legislation that has gone through has related to the primary industries portfolio. A significant part of that legislation has related to increased charges or the imposition of new levies. For example, in 1982&hyphen;83, $391 million was raised from the rural sector. Ten years later, in 1992&hyphen;93, around $719 million was raised from levies, almost a doubling in the charges that are applied to the primary industry sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These two bills are concerned with funding the Australian Animal Health Council Ltd, at an initial operative rate of 5c per head for cattle or a prescribed rate up to a maximum of 50c per head. Charges are to be imposed on cattle other than dairy cattle exported from Australia by the Cattle Export Charge Act 1990. Additionally, I draw it to the attention of the Senate that the cattle producers pay a levy under the Cattle Transaction Levy Act on the sale of cattle, delivery to a processor and the slaughter of certain cattle. Both of the principal acts are amended here to take account of the need to provide funding for this new body, the Australian Animal Health Council Ltd.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3899">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The AAHC is an unlisted public company limited by a guarantee&mdash;the partners being the Commonwealth, the states and the territories, and industry organisations. As Senator Collins said, it was established following an agreement on 18 August 1995 by ARMCANZ, the Agriculture and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Its objectives are several: to assist the Australian animal health service system in maintaining acceptable national animal health standards and meeting consumer needs and market requirements at home and overseas; to advise and advocate to government and industry action on such matters as strategic national animal health priorities, animal health system delivery arrangements and resources, and to have an involvement in residue related issues as they relate to animal health and commercial performance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I repeat what I have been saying for about 20 years: the aim of the industry must be for zero residues. It is not enough just to meet the minimal standards that are agreed internationally; we need to promote Australia as a clean source of pure food. We do that not by meeting standards on residues but by having zero residues. While it might be a utopian ideal, that is the objective that we ought to have. Going back to the objectives of the AAHC, it ought to have international status as the national animal health policy and advisory body to arrange for and assist in research and development matters pertaining to animal health.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Collins talked at length about the diseases that we are free of at the present time, saying that good management was involved. That is perfectly true. There has been a great deal of vigilance in the past to prevent exotic diseases coming into Australian pastoral herds. The point is that the geographic isolation of Australia was our greatest asset, and with the permeability&mdash;for want of a better word&mdash;of the boundaries that once existed, that isolation is now greatly reduced, with relatively free and untrammelled access, legally and illegally, into the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> There is a huge influx of passengers and tourists each year into the country. They can bring in foodstuffs despite warnings by the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> customs department to travellers. We really are in a position where we must increase our surveillance and tighten our regimes and disciplines very considerably on what existed in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I express a concern for the standards of quarantine. I do not think that they are as good as they were, and it is a matter for governments of all persuasions to have that as a top priority. The economic consequence to us of an avoidable breach in the quarantine barrier would be indescribable. The consequences would really be quite enormous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The funding for the AAHC will come under three categories. Administration and operations will be funded to the amount of $840,000. Key national animal health care programs, according to the ARMCANZ board report into the AAHC, will receive finance to the amount of $900,000 in 1995&hyphen;96, and a third area to be funded are other national animal health programs, and that will be done on a case&hyphen;by&hyphen;case basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like, in conclusion, to say a few things about the cattle industry. We are in a market downturn at present with respect to cattle prices. It is, far and away, the worst for 20 years. The returns to producers are really very poor. In parts of the country we have drought and, as I was saying earlier, a major drought is in its sixth year in many parts of central Queensland, which is the principal export cattle producing area for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are coping with&mdash;and it is one of the factors driving the market price down&mdash;an oversupply of meat on the market, principally from the United States, where their herd numbers have peaked and they have had good seasons. Coupled with this excess supply, they are marketing very aggressively into our traditional markets in Japan and Korea and around Asia. We cannot compete with them. While we are producing beef through the farm gate at about 60 per cent less than the United States, we are paying three times what the United States pays on average to process that beef. That means that American beef can come in here cheaper than the consumer can buy it from Australian sources. We have got to do quite a bit to improve our processing to get into a competitive position.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3900">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are in a position where we do not have any stability with respect to overheads. Year by year those costs are going up, and the returns to producers have shifted in a major way. Once upon a time, if you took a notional value per kilogram of beef on the consumer's table the major part of that would have gone to the producer. Today, the processor, the wholesaler and the retailer take the major part of that price for the kilogram of beef and the producer gets the minor part. The difficulty with that is that the producer's costs, as I have said, keep going up and up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a competitive industry. You have to have herd improvement, improvement in pastures, water retention, and the rest of it. Those are really big sums that have to be met, and they do require a higher profit level than the industry is getting at the present time if the industry is to be sustained. The whole of rural Australia is declining in population and that has some significant sociological consequences. I do not want to get into that, but I was reading the other day that the ABS has claimed that in the last 30 years we have lost over 100,000 farms. That is a pretty significant factor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To turn back to the industry itself, it really is in crisis. I look at an industry such as the cotton industry, which is one of the great rural successes in Australia, and I wonder why it has been so successful compared to the beef and sheep industries. One of the conclusions I reach is that the cotton industry is a new industry and it does not carry the baggage in its haversack that the older, established industries which have been around for a hundred or a couple of hundred years do. They can use new and efficient management practices and, starting with a clean sheet, they can optimise their size to maximise their results.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do think that, to survive, the cattle industry has to change&mdash;and change significantly&mdash;from what it is today. I say `to survive' advisedly because, for the first time in my life, I have doubts about the long term survival of the cattle industry in the export field in Australia. It will be a tragic loss for us, economically and in other ways, if we lose this great industry which I think is probably <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the biggest of all Australia's export primary industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only area where we have had any success in recent years has been the live cattle exports from northern Queensland and the Northern Territory. That has undeniably been a godsend for us. There would have been many more people driven out of the industry but for that. But, at the end of the day, that is not the field that we want to focus on and put our emphasis on, because there is no value adding in that. In a sense, it is just a rather feudal way of trading&mdash;you are just producing young cattle and exporting them. We want to be in the business of value adding and exporting high quality carton beef. But, before we get there, the industry has to be reorganised very considerably.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of our principal problems relates to abattoirs. I would say&mdash;just off the top of my head&mdash;that we are down to between one&hyphen;third and a half of the abattoirs that existed 20 years ago. The significance of that is profound because the abattoirs are very important players in this. They are really the price setters for the producer. The producer is a price taker, and if the abattoirs are not buying the producer cannot get rid of his stock. There is now no competition between abattoirs. They are enjoying a degree of natural protection because of their few numbers. And the geography of Australia means that if you are going to truck 500 miles to a competitor you are going to pay an economic penalty, whatever price he is offering you, and you are not going to recover that. So the shrinkage in the number of abattoirs is very important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The relationship between producers and abattoirs has changed very considerably in my lifetime. Once upon a time, established reliable producers, working with abattoirs, had a good give and take relationship based on mutual trust. In other words, if an abattoir got an export order and wanted to fill that order, it would ring up a reliable producer and the producer would let cattle go even if they were not ready for market. The producer would take a little bit less than the payment for them, because they were not as far forward as they might be. The producer would know in return that if he got caught out with the dry <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3901"> season, or a drought or something like that, he could ring up the abattoirs and they would oblige him and, even if they did not want the stock, they would take them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> A totally different relationship exists today between the suppliers and the abattoirs. It is one dictated by the abattoirs and it is on a very hard commercial basis that favours the abattoirs at all times.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing that the abattoirs do is that they write the export orders. Therefore, they have a dominant role in selling and moving the product. When a percentage are owned by overseas interests&mdash;and a very high percentage of those abattoirs are now owned by overseas interests&mdash;you have got to wonder at times what is happening. It is certainly very much in the interests of the Japanese or Korean owners of a abattoir to pay the minimal price in this country and maximise their returns in their country of origin, or where the final sale is made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very much of the view that we ought to be seriously looking at the ownership of abattoirs. I have no objection at all to overseas interests owning the source of production&mdash;owning cattle properties and sheep properties&mdash;subject to following good farming and environmental practices. But I think that it is a different matter again when we get into the abattoirs. I do think that we ought to have in place some mechanism which maximises Australian influence and control over those. I am not interested in seeing vertical integration in the industry from the field to the table.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we do not do something seriously about this, I believe that we will end up importing carton beef from somewhere like Indonesia for consumption within Australia. The live beef trade will go on. It will be processed overseas and come back to us in polythene wraps. I think that would an economic tragedy for us of enormous proportion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, getting back to the abattoirs: I think that the important thing there is to encourage new players into the industry. We cannot encourage them unless they are profitable, and they cannot be profitable with many of the work practices that exist at the present time. The passage of the industrial relations bill is absolutely essential for us, so that we can get <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> good employer and employee relationships there that are based on productivity and provide an incentive so that we can get our unit costs for processing down to about a third of what they are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing that we have got to do is to be able to market a consistent product with known grades of quality. This is a very difficult problem. The Americans are moving well down that path and the Australian exporting industry also has to get to the stage where it can market beef that is graded and consistently reliable in quality, so that the consumers know what they are going to get when they buy it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also got to establish an Australian brand. I think that the industry may well go to a regional basis. I would like to see the feasibility explored of something like the Central Queensland area running Capricornia beef, or something like that, and marketing that internationally with a consistent product available with consistent quality, and having it recognised as such.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not really want to take too much time in the Senate this afternoon, but I believe that the industry is in crisis at the present time. I think that it has to do a great deal of analysis of where it is going, and take the steps itself to address those problems. Along the way it does need support from government in things like maintaining the health of herds through quarantine procedures and through government allowing it to operate in an economically competitive way, by passing legislation that allows competitive international practices to be introduced into the abattoirs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With those few words, I wish the bills good passage.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I thank those senators who have participated in this debate. I particularly thank Senator Collins, Senator Woodley and Senator MacGibbon for their contributions. I will also say a word or two about Senator Woodley, who has actually realised that this debate wants to be proceeded with quickly. I thank him for his asking of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3902"> the questions and the fact that he is very happy that I tabled some replies. I will take up a couple of points that he has made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the longest serving senator on the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare, and as a patron of the RSPCA in New South Wales, I am very aware of the issues surrounding the live sheep trade. It is important to note that Senator Woodley has quoted from the committee's report on the live sheep trade. The committee also acknowledged that `the animal welfare aspects of the trade cannot be divorced from economic and other considerations.' I take on board the remarks made by Senator Woodley in respect of live sheep. I would also like to reiterate the significant growth Australia has experienced in livestock exports generally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For our sheep and cattle producers, the live export trade is becoming an important market and one with enormous potential. There is no question that animal welfare considerations must be recognised in this trade. I believe the regulations and protocols put in place by the Commonwealth government are appropriate. One of the questions Senator Woodley asked was whether the AAHC handles animal welfare concerns and, if not, why not. Included in the objectives set out in the AAHC's memorandum of association is the requirement to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> be concerned about the link between good animal welfare practices and trade requirements and sanctions, as well as good commercial performance.</PARA>
<PARA>This does not cover the full range of community animal welfare issues. The Government's peak animal welfare policy advisory body, the National Consultative Committee on Animal Welfare, will continue to operate, and state and territory governments have legislative responsibilities for administering animal welfare.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the National Consultative Committee on Animal Welfare was established by the previous government, and its current chair is Dr Judith Blackshaw from Queensland, whose work in the area of animal welfare is well known and long standing. The council also has representatives from the Australian and New Zealand Federation of Animal <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Societies, the NFF, the NHMRC, the Australian Veterinary Association and RSPCA Australia. It provides advice to the minister on a range of animal welfare issues and is an appropriate forum where the wider community's concerns about animal welfare can be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Woodley also asked about the veterinarians for New Zealand live sheep and the fact that New Zealand has vets and Australia does not. The New Zealand live sheep trade supplies only one market in the Middle East, and that is Saudi Arabia. The Saudis insist that a vet accompany each voyage to their market. New Zealand shipments also have a higher incidence of pasteurella pneumonia which can be treated on board, thus lessening mortality rates. On Australian ships, vets have been employed on trial shipments or where an exporter wants to check up on practices on board. Vets on those ships tend to carry out the odd post&hyphen;mortem and, at the end of the voyage, write a report. Rarely do they influence the mortality rate on any shipment. Exporters, though, employ experienced stockmen, often with long periods of service, to accompany the shipments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another question the senator asked was about the trade. If I may seek the concurrence of the Senate, I would be very happy to table a document expressing the trade to the Middle East, which began in 1960.</PARA>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">LIVE SHEEP CARRIER `UNICEB'&mdash;INDIAN OCEAN INCIDENT</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A fire broke out on Saturday 31 August in the engine room of the Italian owned (Sistren Services), Panama flagged, live sheep vessel `Uniceb' which is chartered to exporters Wellards. The vessel left Fremantle on 23 August carrying 67,500 <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3903"> sheep bound for the Red Sea port of Aqaba in Jordan.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most reports indicate that the fire broke out on either Saturday 31 August or Sunday 1 September, but this is yet to be verified. It is most likely the ship as 900&hyphen;1000 miles  north&hyphen;east of Seychelles when the fire broke out.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It appears the fire commenced in the engine room and spread rapidly to accommodation areas above causing the crew to abandon ship. The ship's engineer was lost overboard during this time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The crew later reboarded the ship and endeavoured to fight the fire, but were driven off by heat and smoke. They then drifted in life rafts for 20 hours or more until picked up by a passing ship the `Mineral Century' on Monday 2 September. (This vessel arrived in Suez on Tuesday 10 September.)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are not aware of any radio, phone or beacon contact during the fire. Upon hearing of the fire by radio from the rescue vessel on the Monday, the Italian owners dispatched on Tuesday a fire fighting tug from Djibouti to the vessel in salvage/rescue attempt. The owners also on Tuesday diverted the `Cormo Express' to the scene. This vessel had just completed unloading sheep in Karachi.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both the salvage tug and the `Cormo Express' arrived at the point of last sighting on  Friday 6 September. A US military aircraft also participated in the search on either the Friday afternoon or Saturday covering approximately 200 sq miles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the Tuesday 10 September reports confirmed that debris consistent with the sinking of the `Uniceb' had been sighted floating in the vicinity and it was concluded that the ship had sunk. The search mission was then called off.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ship's charterers, Wellard Rural Exports, believed the ship sank soon after the fire began. This is based on the fact that two explosions were heard by the crew drifting in lifeboats after they were forced to abandon the ship and that, in the period between the ship being abandoned and the sighting of the debris, there were no reports of a ship on fire in a major shipping lane into Suez and the Middle East.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the International Convention of Safety of Life at Sea, the flag registry, in this case Panama, is required to undertake an inquiry. This is now being conducted by the Panama representative in Bombay and is expected to take some months. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority has contacted the Panamanian authorities noting the implications for Australia and requesting a copy of the report of the inquiry into the incident. Further action by Australian authorities will be decided in the light of the report of the Panamanian inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  (6/9/96), the Maritime Union of Australia alleged that the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Uniceb had left port hurriedly before the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) could investigate International Transport Workers' Federation concerns about conditions for the crew and stock on board.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AMSA has confirmed that allegations were made about unsatisfactory conditions on the vessel. These related to operation of the crew accommodation air conditioning system, incorrectly flushing toilets and suspect drinking water quality. AMSA has confirmed it investigated the claims and in relation to the toilets and drinking water found them to be without substance. AMSA also was satisfied with the outcome of discussions with the ship's engineer regarding air conditioning in the crew's accommodation. AMSA reported there were no problems with the animal accommodation and that the ship had passed inspection in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control and the Marine Orders. The `Uniceb' had a track record as a good, reliable vessel meeting all AMSA standards.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">THE TRADE</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The trade to the Middle East began in the 1960s and, with the advent of larger and more technically advanced vessels, expanded rapidly to meet strong growth in demand in the region for freshly killed meat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. Last year Australia exported some 5.5 million sheep worth around $207 million. Figures to end June 1996 are currently running at the same levels as last year. The Middle East is the primary destination for shipments (99%) with the UAE and Jordan the single largest importing countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. There are currently 25 licensed livestock exporters and 63 importers in 29 countries of Australian sheep. The majority of animals used in the trade are sourced from producers in WA, SA, VIC, and southern NSW.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. While there was an increase in the carcass trade following the halting of live exports to Saudi Arabia in 1991, it should be noted that there was a corresponding significant increase in live exports to neighbouring countries in subsequent years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">4. The AMLC estimates that, at a minimum, 800,000 Australian live sheep are exported each year to other Middle Eastern countries, particularly UAE and Qatar, and then slaughtered and exported to Saudi Arabia as sheep meat. The UAE has undergone sustained growth since 1990, becoming Australia's second largest market for live sheep.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">5. This points to the fact that a number of countries in the Middle East, including  Saudi Arabia, retain a strong preference for freshly killed meat which can only be met by the live animal trade.  <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3904"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">6. The AMLC maintains a regular promotional program to encourage increased consumption of chilled and frozen sheep meat. Through its overseas offices in key markets the ALMA promotes the trade through a comprehensive program of consumer and trade advertising and sales promotion backed up by a technical support service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">7. The advertising strategy focuses on newspapers and magazines portraying Australian sheep meat as high quality and produced by a professional industry. General merchandising and point&hyphen;of&hyphen;sale material is also provided to stores carrying Australian sheep meat to differentiate the product from competitors. The AMLC technical officers advise retailers and consumers on the characteristics and specifications of Australian meat and conducts butcher training programs on handling, preparation and presentation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">8. The AMLC's efforts to promote sheep meat consumption also extend to regularly contacting government officials, importers and agents to maintain Australia's reputation as a supplier of high quality and safe product and reassure them, where appropriate, of the integrity of our export certification system.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RD4">Senator BROWNHILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The other question was basically covered by Senator Collins in his speech, but I will make a couple of points about whether the AAHC should formally present a report to parliament. The answer to that is no. Provision of annual reports to parliament is a requirement that is imposed on statutory authorities of the Commonwealth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The AAHC is a non&hyphen;profit company, limited by guarantee established under the Corporations Law. It is jointly owned by the Commonwealth, the state and Northern Territory governments and nine separate industry bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The AAHC is fully accountable under its memorandum of association and articles of association to its member organisations. It must hold annual general meetings and prepare strategic and annual operational plans for members' approval. Any member dissatisfied with the performance of the AAHC may extinguish its financial obligation to the company by providing six months notice of resignation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The AAHC also comes under the jurisdiction of the Australian Securities Commission. The ASC is a Commonwealth agency which stands for honesty and fairness in business. It <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> works to prevent corporate crime and to protect investors by providing information about companies, helping business to interpret the law, and taking action against offenders. Copies of the AAHC's annual reports must be lodged with the ASC and the public will have free access to the documents through the ASC.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is fair to start off by saying that a new senator is entitled to some latitude in this chamber, but it is also equally important, I think, that people around Australia&mdash;particularly those in Tasmania&mdash;are not misled by some of the statements that are made. Therefore, I think it is necessary for me to correct the record on a couple of important matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, the claim was made that job cuts have occurred under the guidance of the previous board of Telstra. I think that is really saying that, under the ALP, Telstra embarked on an efficiency drive which was necessary at that time in order to ensure that it could compete effectively and deliver lower prices to consumers. It is doing precisely the same thing again. It has nothing to do with privatisation. Senator O'Brien went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no reason to think that the likely reduction in the number of its employees by 500 to 700 will be changed by the new board.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know where these figures come from. The total number of Telstra jobs in Tasmania in 1995&hyphen;96 was 1,460. If there was that sort <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3906"> of reduction you would be talking about up to 50 per cent of Tasmanian jobs being lost.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Sorry? You have not got the submission done yet? I am sorry, I cannot help you. The second part of the speech, which I think also deserves to be addressed, is the statement:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Worse than that, with the part&hyphen;privatisation of Telstra, Tasmania will lose the benefits of cross&hyphen;subsidisation of its telephone and related services that a publicly owned system brings.</PARA>
<PARA>This seems to have been borrowed from another new recruit to the debate, Senator Allison, who is running around suggesting that cross&hyphen;subsidisation would disappear if Telstra were partially privatised. Of course, the fact is that this is absolutely incorrect. Anyone who has read the Telecommunications Act&mdash;I suspect that not too many have&mdash;would know that there is already a provision entrenched in that legislation which guarantees that, to the extent that services in rural and remote areas are uneconomic, they must be cross&hyphen;subsidised out of a universal service <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> fund contributed to by all the carriers on a pro rata basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That will continue unless, of course, the Labor Party is proposing to move an amendment to open the system up. I am not aware of that. Maybe Senator Schacht has it up his sleeve for later on. But I would not support it, I have to tell you, Senator Schacht. If you want to remove the current legislative prohibition on the guarantees, the cross&hyphen;subsidies to rural and remote areas, you should tell us about it now, but, for one, I could not support it in a fit. It would be very unfair. It certainly would not be in the best interests of Tasmanians or in the best interests of the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just to make doubly sure that those arrangements stay in place, we have reaffirmed the commitment in the Telstra (Dilution of Ownership) Bill. So it is going to be there in spades. I do not know why you would want to remove that. It seems extraordinary to me and I hope you will reconsider. I know it is an important issue and I know you want to take it seriously. If you want some advice on that, we are happy to give it to you, but I am putting you on notice here and now that we are not prepared to support any amendment that you might move on that basis.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Resources and Energy. Minister, as you are no doubt aware, BHP Gemco manganese mine on Groote Island pleaded guilty in March this year to causing water pollution and were given a $45,000 fine for losing what was said to be at the time 900,000 litres of diesel fuel oil from its tanks down under the island. In fact, after investigations, senior management at the mine now admit that there is a minimum of 3 million litres of diesel fuel oil which has leaked from the mine's tanks down into the terrestrial environment. Others put this figure as high as 10 million litres. Have you been paying a diesel fuel rebate to this company? If so, how much? Have you deducted for the amount that is now under the island? Will your government continue to give the mine a diesel fuel rebate, if you have been doing so?

But the two are totally unrelated. The usage of fuel where it is legitimate under the Customs Act would attract the diesel fuel rebate.

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am explaining why I was not surprised. The recent <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">State of the environment</EMPHASIS>  report, which I just released, said that on occasions the level of air pollution in Sydney approached that of New York and Tokyo. So it is therefore not surprising that Sydneysiders rate air pollution as the No. 1 environment issue that they face.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The good news is that the new government has kept another of its promises; that is, the promise to establish a major independent inquiry to examine solutions to combat urban air pollution. The national inquiry will be conducted by the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering  with the aim of exploring innovative and practical solutions to urban air pollution problems. I am pleased with the enthusiasm with which the academy has taken up this challenge. In fact, the academy advises me that even before the inquiry had been publicly announced they were already receiving offers of assistance from fellows of that academy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been previous inquiries and reports into the causes and extent of air pollution. The difference with the new inquiry is that it is designed to avoid simply going over that old ground. Its terms of reference focus on identifying practical measures that can be taken by governments, industry, community groups and individuals to improve air quality in Australian towns and cities in the medium to long term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The academy has the scientific and technical expertise required to make the assessment and to propose those practical solutions. It has <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3915"> a worldwide reputation for scientific excellence. Under its direction, the inquiry will address the capacity of existing policies and strategies to reduce air pollution. The inquiry will complement the work of the National Environment Protection Council, which is developing a national environment protection measure for ambient air quality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report is expected to be received in about 12 months; it is a one-year project. I am confident that out of it will come practical ideas to improve the air quality in our urban environment, particularly in those major cities that have been suffering so badly on occasions in the past.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Communications and the Arts. Can the minister inform the Senate of the steps he has taken to accelerate Telstra's introduction of advanced telecommunications services and to ensure that those Australians living in non-metropolitan areas are not disadvantaged in the accessing of these services?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="3916" SPEAKER="Alston, Sen Richard" NAMEID="LD4" ELECTORATE="VIC" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Communications and the Arts" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is actually a very important question because the extent to which people in rural and remote areas have access to services is obviously critical if they are not to be left behind in keeping up with the latest technologies. Before we came to office, Labor had simply allowed what is called the future mode of operation, the roll&hyphen;out of digital exchanges, to limp along past the year 2000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of discussions we have had with Telstra, they are now committed to the effective completion of that roll&hyphen;out program by December 1998. That will mean that Telstra will be able to provide many enhanced services to customers served through a digital exchange including call diversion, call waiting, e-mail, caller line identification&mdash;all very important enhanced services. Furthermore, by December 1997 the digitisation rate&mdash;in other words, the percentage of total exchanges which will be converted to digital&mdash;will be the same in metropolitan as in country areas: 85 five per cent. That is, of course, very good news for those in non-metropolitan areas after years of neglect by Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3917"> There is more good news because, from July 1997, 93.4 per cent of customers will be able to obtain an ISDN service within 90 days of request. That will mean that both business and domestic users will be able to dial up fast digital connections as easily as making a phone call. Those sorts of new services will include multiple phones and faxes on the same line; much faster access to fax machines; fast EFTPOS links; fast access to the Internet for educational, cultural and information services; small-screen video confer encing; shared screens; and virtual production groups, so that people in different locations can collaborate and produce high fidelity sound and fast text and graphics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of these will be available only because of the actions that the government has taken. In many countries areas they do not even get the speed that the normal telephone service delivers to people in metropolitan areas of 28.8 kilobytes per second. In some areas they are down around the level of 3 kilobytes per second. As a result of the introduction of ISDN, you will have 64 kilobytes per second. Indeed, on the two lines that are available, that can be conformed so that you get 128 kilobytes per second.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, that will be an enormous advantage for those people in rural areas who are wanting to get access to the Internet for a whole range of reasons, commercial and educational. Farmers will find it of great use to be able to tap in for weather reports, for changes in commodity prices and for the latest research on farming programs. Students living outside the metropolitan areas will also have enormous opportunities to get access. They will not have to wait forever, as is often the case now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the principal things that put people off using the Internet, as Senator Patterson, Senator Hill and I discovered recently, is the enormous amount of time that it can take for downloading, and particularly for graphics to come up on the screen. That is a function of the speed of the system and that is why an ISDN link, and a number of the other technologies that will be much more readily available, will make a huge difference to people who would otherwise have had to languish under Labor's previous approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra is also actively pursuing options to use emerging technology to provide similar digital and ISDN services to those who are living more than five kilometres beyond an exchange. Similarly, for those who are on digital remote concentrator systems, there will be other improvements that Telstra and others will be wanting to introduce as quickly as possible. We are doing what Labor never contemplated doing. Indeed, I can remember Michael Lee running scare campaigns and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> suggesting that this was going to cost billions of dollars. I was delighted that Senator Schacht, by his inaction, effectively endorsed this initiative when we released it recently and I am therefore glad that we have bipartisan support.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I ask a supplementary question. I am a little disappointed that the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Family Services is unable to answer on an issue which is of such fundamental importance to a large number in the Australian community. But while she is asking the minister the answer to the previous question, firstly, could she also find out from the minister what the net worth of the rebate will be in light of the premium increases in private health insurance since the budget; and, secondly, could the minister tell us what increased percentage participation in private health insurance is anticipated to come about annually as a result of the private health insurance rebates?</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are at present three notifications by health insurance funds of proposed rule changes increasing premiums under consideration by the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The health insurance incentives are worth exactly as much as they were before the premium increases: up to $450 a year for families, $250 for couples and $125 for singles. As the premium increases would have occurred anyway, people receiving the incentives will still be up to $450 a year better off than they would have been in the absence of the incentives.  <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3918"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The `net worth' of the incentives will thus be up to $450 a year for families, $250 for couples and $125 for singles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is estimated that in the absence of the incentives the private health insurance participation rate would have fallen to around 31 per cent by July 1997. It is estimated that the announcement of the incentives will slow the rate of decline, resulting in a participation rate of 32 per cent by July 1997. The incentives are estimated to increase the participation rate by 2 percentage points through the 1997&hyphen;98 financial year. Together with the estimated impact of the Medicare surcharge for uninsured high income earners, the participation rate at the end of the 1997&hyphen;98 financial year is estimated to be 35.5 per cent.</PARA></QUESTION></QUESTION.BLOCK></QWN>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3920">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that Senator Short has owned up until today nearly 7,000 ANZ shares. His explanation to the Senate today after he had been caught out by the Labor opposition was to say that he is going to direct his broker to divest of them today. Of course he should have done that as soon as he had been commissioned as Assistant Treasurer in April because in that role he is directly responsible in the government of Australia for banking and superannuation matters. This is a clear conflict of interest. There is no question that he has been involved in high level discussions and has helped make decisions. There is a clear conflict of interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This issue goes right to the heart of probity in government. It goes right to the issue of integrity. This is beyond incompetence. This is beyond the fact that Senator Short is a failure. We know that Senator Short is not up to the job. We know that he should not have been appointed minister, but we have a situation today when Mr Howard said in the House of Representatives, `I regret very much the Assistant Treasurer's handling of this matter.' Mr Howard regrets it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Hill would not cut the Assistant Treasurer loose. I gave him ample opportunity during question time to support that. He said on two occasions that he didn't regret the Assistant Treasurer's handling of this matter. You ought to get your lines right, Senator Hill. Quite clearly, this minister has been exposed by the Labor Party as having a conflict of interest. He has done the wrong thing for a long period of time and he has been caught out red&hyphen;handed by Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Will Mr Howard do the right thing and sack him, as he should? This is a minister who has breached the Prime Minister's ministerial code of conduct. Who can forget Mr Howard, puffed up with all his self&hyphen;importance, his bombast and pomposity, saying, `This will be a government of probity. This will be a government that cares about ministerial responsibility. This will be a government that cares about the importance of parliamentary process.' This minister has failed on all counts.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we have had a very shameful and grubby attack by this disgusting opposition on one of our most dignified and distinguished members of the ministry. Therefore, it gives me a great deal of pleasure to rise in support of my colleague Senator Short.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Short has an expertise that is not in the opposition and is second to none in the financial field. He has an outstanding record of achievement. It grieves me very much to hear the sorts of comments coming out of the mouths of such people as Senator Sherry and the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Faulkner).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After 13 years of Labor's mismanagement, Australia desperately needs the expertise that Senator Short brings to this portfolio. What is your agenda? A grubby exercise to try to get rid of him. You have failed now and you will fail in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Integrity and decency have been the hallmarks of Senator Short's whole career and his participation in this Senate. This expertise has been achieved over many years. He has applied remarkable intellect and assiduous hard work to one of the most difficult tasks that this country faces&mdash;it is facing it because of the neglect and mismanagement of the former government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his early years in the Treasury, he rose very quickly to senior responsibility. Between 1967 and 1970, he held the important position of Treasury representative in London, where he was held in very high regard for his competency and his integrity. Between 1971 and 1975, he held two high level positions: Assistant Secretary in the Overseas Economic Relations Division and Assistant Secretary in the Foreign Investment Division of Treasury.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To hear the rubbish coming from the opposition alleging incompetence just does not fit with the facts. Members of the opposition are not interested in the facts. They are not interested in the truth. They are trying to impugn things that are just not there. What we have heard today are long bows and minuscule perceptions leading to incorrect <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3921"> conclusions. The manner of the questioning was quite disgraceful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On entering the federal parliament as the member for Ballarat, he immediately took up positions on the Joint Statutory Committee of Public Accounts. He was also a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. He discharged his responsibility with great dignity. Following his defeat in the election in 1980, he became General Manager, Corporate Affairs, of ACI International, a position which very suitably equipped him for service in the area of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During his time in the Senate, he has held a number of responsible positions where his informed contribution, especially in finance, has been of great benefit to this nation. That should be put on the public record. These include being the spokesman on finance and Deputy Leader of the Opposition. His outstanding ability to grasp the complexities of economic issues is an invaluable asset not just to the government but, I put to you, to the whole of Australia and all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is indeed true that he has had a share portfolio, but what is the shame in that? He has acknowledged this and his record is on the register. The grubby manner in which they go through these registers to pick out long bows and inaccuracies and come to incorrect conclusions I think is disgraceful. He has held high&hyphen;level positions in a large multinational company. Naturally, you would expect a man who has a considerable achievement to have built up some share portfolio interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is noted that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Senator Sherry) has backtracked on his allegations of impropriety in this field, and so he should. I believe what he has put forward today is quite mischievous and the manner in which he has brought it to the press brings no honour or credit to Senator Sherry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This morning the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Short) assured the Senate that he is not a share trader. That is the important point&mdash;he is not there to make money. After all, what would his interest in that portfolio have on one of the largest companies in Australia? It would be absolutely minuscule. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> We have to look at the materiality of events.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The guidelines do apply to parliamentary secretaries&mdash;you had better go and read them if you ever want to be one. In terms of Senator Short's and Senator Gibson's responsibilities, Senator Short had specific responsibility back in April for insurance and superannuation and he has specific responsibility for administration of the banking laws&mdash;quite specific responsibility. He has been involved in policy development. He partly admitted it today. Although, when we pressed him about whether he had declared his interest at cabinet meetings, he would not own up and he would not tell us what he had done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But he had a very clear conflict of interest&mdash;shareholdings in ANZ and responsibility for the administration of banking and superannuation in respect of RSAs and banks.

What is amazing is that Senator Short still will not admit that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3922"> he had a conflict of interest.

No, Senator Short believes he can hold 6,670-odd shares in ANZ&mdash;not a small holding. He has almost 7,000 shares, which will be sold today at a profit of over $8,000. So Senator Short&mdash;having been caught out and called to order by Labor, which looked at the pecuniary interest register&mdash;makes a profit out of selling his shares.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look have a look at them.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real fault here lies with the Prime Minister in John Howard. Let us go back to the system that is put in place to make sure that prime ministerial guidelines cannot be breached. The Prime Minister in the parliament put down the guidelines on ministerial behaviour. Today in the House of Representatives he confirmed that Senator Short was in breach of those guidelines. He said he was in breach. He also said that last night he did consider whether to dismiss Senator Short. He decided against that because, and I seek to paraphrase only, he did not see&mdash;</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was a hanging fence and, as Senator Collins interjects, this may have been inadvertent. That may be true, but why did the Prime Minister set up these guidelines, set up a system where ministers declare not only their shareholdings but the value of their shareholdings, the value of their debts? I assume that all that material was put in in time, by 27 May, across to the Prime Minister. The responsibility for examining that confidential material rests with the Prime Minister so that he can determine whether there will be any future potential conflict of interest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is where the weakness is. Do we have a lazy Prime Minister who did not bother to go through the 27 declarations from ministers and the 10 from parliamentary secretaries? Did the Prime Minister delegate that to a staff member? Was there a failure at that particular level? It is quite clear from the very statements and answers today that Senator Short still does not concede properly that there was a breach of the guidelines. He goes back to the fact that he does not believe that, in his past record&mdash;I believe him over this part&mdash;any of his decisions in government were influenced by his shareholdings. That is not the point: the point is that Senator Short continued to own these shares&mdash;in a very sensitive area that he had direct responsibility for&mdash;for six months. It was the Prime Minister's responsibility to draw this to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3924"> Senator Short's attention and ask him to dispose of the shares.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is nothing new in this, because we know that, on 20 March, Senator Parer&mdash;either at a profit or a loss; I will not speculate either way&mdash;sold his shares in mining companies so that there would not be a conflict of interest. As well as that, we know that Mr Anderson sold his shares so that there would not be a conflict of interest. It is all very well for Senator Panizza to volunteer here today that Senator Short is going to sell all the rest of his shares. With due respect, that ain't on the record anywhere. It has not been said&mdash;you presumed it. Senator Short said today that he would sell his ANZ shares. The point about the profit from those shares is that it is not the profit from when Senator Short bought the shares to when he sells the shares, but the profit from when he should have sold the shares until today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here we are&mdash;we must be the great mugs of the world. We expose the conflict of interest, we shame the Prime Minister into directing Senator Short to sell the shares&mdash;and what happens? He is nine grand better off! He is $9,000 better off. He should donate that to charity or somewhere else. I will even let him claim against the tax so that he gets something out of it and everyone wins. There is just a modicum of unfairness that, having absolutely breached the Prime Minister's guidelines&mdash;unlike Senator Parer and M Anderson&mdash;he is a few bob in front, according to Senator Panizza. You mentioned Lindsay before: the mob out there would love to make an extra nine grand in a few months, having just breached a minor guideline.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real fault here goes back to John Howard. He came in with this pompous attitude. `Look at our high standards,' he said. `I am setting them down for the record. We're more prissy, we're more pure, we're better than anyone else.' The first time we try to apply that particular principle when someone is in breach of the guidelines, does he dismiss that minister? No, he does not. He does not touch him at all. He hits him over the wrist with a limp piece of lettuce. In the end it is Mr Howard who is responsible here, not Senator Short.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that, when it comes to ministerial propriety, this government has the runs on the board. Senator Ray suggests to us that our Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is somehow responsible for this situation when their Prime Minister failed to lodge his tax returns. What absolute and utter contempt. Mr Keating was the Treasurer at the time that he failed to lodge his tax return. What a great example to the rest of Australia! What a fine example! To make it even better, when he became Prime Minister, not satisfied with failing to lodge his tax returns, he failed to disclose his interests in piggeries. We all know about that, don't we? We all know about the shameful episode that the then Prime Minister took ministerial propriety into on that occasion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now want to talk about the matters raised by Senator Sherry. He talked about this huge amount of money&mdash;$8,000. Let me say to those in the gallery that Senator Sherry earned five times that amount in one year from travel allowance. He earned $41,868 travel allowance, courtesy of the Australian taxpayer. I apologise: his travel allowance was $43,200. I got the figure wrong&mdash;it is even more. It was in relation to car hire that he sucked out $41,000&hyphen;plus dollars from the Australian taxpayer. So, just in those two areas, Senator Sherry sucked out more than $84,000 from the taxpayer, yet he seeks to condemn a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3925"> minister who has possibly overlooked $8,000&mdash;10 per cent of the amount that Senator Sherry is talking about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We then had Senator Faulkner in here leading off the debate for the opposition. He was talking about standards and what a great success, by implication, he must have been as a minister. We all recall those embarrassing moments for Senator Faulkner when he was minister for the environment. In question time after question time he told us about ground truthing and that all these things were being done very well to ensure that the forest industry was being looked after. All that advice was based on none other than Natalie. Do you remember Senator Faulkner's red face, question time after question time, the  humiliation of Senator Faulkner, question time after question time? In fact, we on the opposition side, at that stage, started to feel sorry for Senator Faulkner. For him to come in here and say that some other minister's ministerial performance is not quite up to scratch is really the pot calling the kettle black.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Faulkner's contribution as a minister was really something that we on this side laughed at, the public laughed at and, ultimately&mdash;and this is the big thing&mdash;the Australian people laughed at. The people in regional Australia rejected the forestry agreement that Senator Faulkner hobbled together&mdash;because it was absolutely outrageous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Robert Ray tells us that we have a lazy Prime Minister. Our Prime Minister fronts up to every question time to answer the sorts of questions that he did today.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commonwealth Government response to the report of the Senate Economics References Committee inquiry into the proposal to interconnect the New South Wales and Queensland electricity grids (Eastlink) with a high voltage powerline.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Preamble</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Summary of the ERC Inquiry process and outcomes</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 30 March 1995, the Senate agreed that the Economics References Committee (ERC) conduct an inquiry into aspects of the Eastlink proposal. It was agreed that submissions were to be received by 2 June 1995, with the ERC to report on or before 28 September 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ERC released its Report out of parliamentary session on 18 December 1995. The ERC's findings <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3926"> are based on 274 written submissions, over 1,000 form letters and evidence provided at public hearings in Armidale, Toowoomba, Melbourne and Canberra conducted over October/November 1995. ERC members also conducted&mdash;site inspections of areas affected by the Eastlink proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's role in examining the Eastlink proposal was limited, as the jurisdictional responsibility for electricity supply rests with the State and Territory Governments. The ERC Report notes that its primary function was providing an opportunity for communities to raise their concerns about the Eastlink proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ERC Report details the communities' concerns relating to the economic, environmental, health and social impacts of the Eastlink proposal. The ERC's major recommendations focus on health issues, the community consultation process and compensation arrangements for affected property owners. Incorporated in the ERC document is a minority report by Senator John Woodley (Australian Democrat, Queensland) recommending that governments reconsider their commitment to Eastlink until the concerns raised in the Report have been resolved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Implementation of the ERC recommendations, where appropriate, is largely the responsibility of the New South Wales and Queensland Governments and their respective electricity authorities. The broader issues of future involvement of communities in energy matters and health impacts of electric and magnetic fields (EMFs) have been referred by the ERC to all state governments and relevant scientific research agencies respectively. The Commonwealth was specifically requested to examine the greenhouse gas emission consequences of Eastlink's likely impact on coal consumption.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ERC implied in its Report that Eastlink was expected to proceed, and that the ERC did not oppose the national electricity reforms agreed by the Council of Australian Governments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ERC also notes that the overwhelming majority of submissions were provided by individuals and groups directly affected by the likely siting of the proposed Eastlink powerline. The Report is structured in such a way as to outline the positions of both the Eastlink opponents and proponents, but does not give any indication of the extent to which the ERC evaluated the information provided in each submission and at the public hearings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Media reports relating to the communities' concerns over Eastlink have indicated a limited acceptance of key aspects of the proposal. The ERC notes community scepticism over Eastlink's benefits, and perceived hidden agendas of participants involved in assessment of Eastlink's feasibility. It is noted that the ERC has not considered the impact of such factors, other than to suggest that community <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> misunderstanding of the Eastlink project was the result of an ineffective consultation process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Developments relating to Eastlink since the release of the ERC Report</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the release of the ERC's report on the Eastlink proposal, the Queensland State Government has changed. The incoming Coalition Government announced on 18 March 1996 that in line with its pre-election commitment, grid interconnection along the route under consideration for the Eastlink proposal would be cancelled in preference of establishing greater self sufficiency and reliability in electricity generation. Importantly the Queensland Government did not rule out the possibility of interconnection in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Queensland initiated a competitive tendering process to identify new electricity supply options to meet its future energy needs over the period 1999-2000. On 30 July 1996 the Queensland Government announced the selection of the three preferred bidders to provide the State with a total of 744 MW of new generating capacity. Longer term (beyond 2000) energy options could include the expansion of the Tully Millstream hydro-electric scheme, the expansion of other renewable energy sources, construction of new coal based generation plant and interconnection options other than along the route under consideration for Eastlink.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Queensland Government has indicated its support for the principle of competitive reform of the Queensland electricity supply industry, and to the national electricity market. On 1 August 1996, the Queensland Mines and Energy Minister, the Hon Tom Gilmore, together with the New South Wales Treasurer and Energy Minister, the Hon Michael Egan and the Commonwealth Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator the Hon Warwick Parer, announced in principle agreement to electricity grid interconnection between the States.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commonwealth role in interstate grid interconnection</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the provisions of the Australian Constitution jurisdictional responsibility for the electricity supply industry rests with the State and Territory Governments. In this context progression of grid interconnection between New South Wales and Queensland proposals are the responsibility of the respective State Governments. The Commonwealth's role is essentially one which seeks to facilitate industry reforms that are consistent with the national interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The previous Commonwealth Government's involvement with the Eastlink proposal, and therefore in the ERC inquiry process, is linked to its agreement to contribute up to $7 m for a feasibility study into the proposal over the period 1993-94 to 1995-96. The December 1993 Memo <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3927"> randum of Understanding (MOU) between the Commonwealth, New South Wales and Queensland Governments specified that Commonwealth funding was limited to the feasibility study, and was not to be used in the acquisition of easements or construction of the Eastlink interconnect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The focus of the Eastlink feasibility study was to determine whether the interconnection is technically, economically and environmentally feasible, and selection of the powerline route. If the results of the feasibility study were favourable and a decision taken to proceed with the project, then Eastlink could be constructed before the end of 1999.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth Government notes that the three year feasibility study, including the environmental impact statement, would have provided a better understanding of the unresolved issues of the final transmission line route alignment, and the likely economic, environmental, health and social consequences of Eastlink.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the election in March this year, the Commonwealth Government has worked towards the introduction of a national competitive electricity market, as agreed by the Council of Australian Governments. The Commonwealth Government supports inter-state grid interconnection and/or augmentation, where commercially and environmentally viable, as an important means of maximising the benefits from the national electricity market. This commitment would extend to consideration of alternative options for interconnection in the future by the Queensland and New South Wales Governments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth Government however is conscious of the need for the communities' concerns to be heard, and is sensitive to the sorts of concerns expressed in the Eastlink feasibility study's consultative process and re-iterated over the course of the ERC inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From a national perspective, grid interconnection would mark an important expansion of the competitive national electricity market to be introduced in 1996. Queensland would join New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, Victoria and South Australia to provide a major interconnected market across eastern and southern Australia. Queensland would in the future have the potential to be a significant supplier into the national grid of both conventional and renewable sourced generation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In terms of the creation of a national competitive electricity market, the Australian electricity industry has recently undergone reforms that have resulted in marked increases in efficiency. However, it has been recognised that further significant gains can be achieved through the introduction of competition.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The introduction of a national competitive electricity market as agreed by the Council of Australian <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Governments has the potential to provide significant benefits to all electricity users. Annual benefits of the electricity reforms have been estimated to be around $5 billion, or approximately 20% of the total benefits expected from the national competition policy agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The move to a competitive electricity industry structure will allow a further range of specific energy efficiency benefits to be realised. For example, the market will assist in promoting electricity conservation, the growth of independent energy traders and energy service providers, and removal of price distortions (such as cross subsidies in tariffs). While governments continue to address the issue of including environmental externalities in defining least cost energy services, the introduction of competitive electricity market reforms is fully consistent with the delivery of least cost energy services to all electricity users.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the Council of Australian Governments' meeting of 11 April 1995, Heads of Government signed three inter-governmental agreements. Under the National Competition Policy and Related Reforms Agreement, States and Territories may be eligible for annual Competition Payments from the Commonwealth amounting in total to $4.2 billion up to 2005-06. Competition Payments to States and Territories are an important component of progressing the reform of the electricity industry. They mark the broader importance of electricity industry reform to the nation at large.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Chapter 2&mdash;Health and Electromagnetic Fields</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"In the light of such conflicting evidence, and because it is not possible to scientifically prove a negative, the Committee is unable to totally dismiss the possibility that there may be adverse effects. Similarly, the Committee is unable to conclude that a definite link between high voltage power lines and adverse effects on human health exists and thus that any new policy recommendations need to be made."

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"However, the Committee is able to conclude that simply the fear of detrimental health effects, whether real or imaginary, is in itself having an impact on the lives of some individuals affected by the Eastlink proposal. In acknowledging these community concerns, the Committee takes a similar stand to that of the Gibbs report. The Committee agrees that, as a minimum policy or until such evidence suggests otherwise, the concept of `prudent avoidance' should continue to be practised by government and power authorities." (Paragraph 2.67).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Supported. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3928"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The Committee therefore concludes that, in the case of Eastlink, `prudent avoidance' should mean siting the line as far as possible from houses, outbuildings and other farm facilities." (Paragraph 2.70).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Supported.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"In the absence of extensive field studies on livestock, the Committee is not able to conclude that high voltage power lines affect the health of livestock and crops, nor is it able to conclude that they do not. The Committee therefore recommends that scientific studies should be carried out in Australia on the possible effects of high voltage powerlines on stock and crops." (Paragraph 2.72).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Supported.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The Committee therefore concludes that compensation by power authorities should be extended to those property owners who suffer an economic loss as a result of the construction of Eastlink, regardless of how that loss is brought about." (Paragraph 2.74).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> No Commonwealth action required&mdash;the issue of compensation is a matter for the relevant state governments/authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the recommendations above have been examined in the context of the Eastlink proposal, the associated issues are relevant to all existing and future high voltage transmission powerlines, and to the use of electricity in general.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth Government notes that the potential health impacts of electric and magnetic fields (EMFs) have caused considerable concern within the communities potentially affected by the Eastlink proposal. This could reflect the situation that even with major continuing scientific research programs at the global level, a clear link between EMFs and health problems has been neither established nor disproved. The Commonwealth Government notes that reflecting this situation the ERC did not attempt to make any judgement of the possible health impacts of EMFs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In recognition of the difficulty of disproving any significant health impacts, the electricity supply industry has adopted a `prudent avoidance' approach to managing exposure to EMFs. The Report notes that this principle has previously been endorsed as an appropriate means of addressing the EMFs health issue, and the ERC maintains that this should continue to be the case. The Commonwealth Government supports this position.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth Government notes that the electricity authorities responsible for progressing the Eastlink proposal, TransGrid (New South Wales) and Powerlink (Queensland), have advocated the `prudent avoidance' policy as part of their normal operational procedures. The Commonwealth Government understands that, had the Eastlink <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> proposal proceeded, the `prudent avoidance' policy would have been followed with the powerline being constructed as far as possible from houses, schools and other similar structures. This is entirely consistent with the views of the ERC, and is expected to be the case for future high voltage grid interconnections.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth Government notes that prudent avoidance of EMFs is often discussed as an appropriate analogy to the "as low as reasonably achievable" (ALARA) principle used for exposure to ionising radiation. The quantifiable effects of exposure to ionising radiation have been well-established and this has allowed for exposure limits to be set. As this is not the case for exposure to non-ionising EMFs, the ALARA principle is implicit in the concept of prudent avoidance, on the assumption that "less is best".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth acknowledges that the appropriateness of prudent avoidance as a national public health policy needs to be assessed on the basis of the understanding of potential health effects of EMFs at any given time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Chapter 3&mdash;Environmental Impact</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The Committee questions the practice of carrying out an environmental impact assessment of a proposal when alternatives have not been included in the detailed Environment Impact Statement and when siting of the line is clearly going ahead before the Environment Impact Statement is complete." (Paragraph 3.75).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Not supported&mdash;consideration of Eastlink alternatives was an important element of the Eastlink environment impact assessment process, which was being conducted in accordance with the relevant State and Commonwealth legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ERC notes that there would have been some environmental impacts associated with the Eastlink project. In consideration of the concerns identified during the inquiry, the ERC also noted that landholders and conservationists had taken a "worst case scenario" approach in assessing this potential environmental damage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In February 1995 the New South Wales and Queensland Energy Ministers announced the selection of the Western corridor as the preferred corridor for the Eastlink interconnection. The selection was based on extensive community consultation undertaken in Queensland and New South Wales, to balance community views and social, environmental, health, land use, technical and cost impacts. In accordance with the provisions of the relevant State and Commonwealth legislation, the environmental impact assessment focused on the Western corridor.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An accurate assessment of the environmental impact of the Eastlink transmission line was dependent upon the final route of the powerline, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3929"> which was being determined in conjunction with the environmental impact assessment process. This process was critical to the conduct of the Eastlink feasibility study and the ultimate decision on the project's future. The process followed was consistent with New South Wales, Queensland and Commonwealth environmental assessment legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ERC notes that environmental impact assessments in Queensland are subject to the provisions of the Electricity Act 1994 and the Environment Protection Act 1994, while in NSW the relevant legislation is the Environment Planning and Assessment Act 1979. Under the conditions of the Eastlink feasibility study, a single environmental impact assessment was to be conducted over the Western Corridor which satisfies the requirements of the state legislation, as well as the Commonwealth's Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is worth noting that the terms of reference for the EIS specifically addresses the issues of consideration of alternative interconnection options. The EIS terms of reference specific requirements had been discussed and agreed amongst the assessing agencies, and followed an extensive consultation process which sought to identify the affected communities' concerns. The relevant requirements are detailed in Attachment No. 2, Part B of the EIS terms of reference (at Annex A).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth Government considers that the Eastlink environmental impact statement was being conducted in a manner consistent with the requirements of relevant State and Commonwealth legislation, and these same legislative requirements will be sufficient to adequately assess the environmental feasibility of future interconnections options. It is also worth noting that under the existing Commonwealth, New South Wales and Queensland legislation environmental impact assessments are project specific, reflecting the difficulty in attempting to ascertain the environmental impact of, in the case of Eastlink, powerlines when the route of the powerline is not defined.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should also be noted that there are no legislative restrictions on electricity authorities seeking to negotiate easements with potentially affected landholders in advance of precise line route identification. This allows the authorities the opportunity to better identify potentially adverse impacts of suggested route options, and would assist in the timely construction of the powerline subject to project approval from the relevant State Governments.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> No Commonwealth action required&mdash;this is an issue for the relevant state governments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ERC recommendations and conclusions relating to this chapter of the Report draw upon perceptions of the communities affected by Eastlink over the impacts of the powerline on matters such as property values, agricultural practices (such as agricultural spraying, electric fencing and organic farming), health and regional tourism.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In consideration of these matters the ERC turned its attention to the compensation arrangements and the Eastlink feasibility study's consultation process. These matters are issues for the New South Wales and Queensland Governments to address, as the Commonwealth Government does not have jurisdictional responsibility for determining compensation arrangements relating to the Eastlink proposal. There are well established legislative procedures in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3930"> place in New South Wales and Queensland to address compensation issues. It is noted that the Committee has provided suggestions on how the State Governments could apply compensation arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a general comment, the Commonwealth understands that the communities were consulted over potential compensation, and that provision of detailed advice on compensation was provided to those property owners within the Western Corridor.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth Government notes that the issue of the effectiveness of community consultation processes is a difficult matter to evaluate. While the ERC notes that the New South Wales and Queensland electricity authorities made every effort to consult the community over the Eastlink proposal, one of the key factors of concern to the community was the perception that the community was not asked whether Eastlink was necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth Government considers that in a competitive national electricity market the need for grid interconnection between New South Wales and Queensland will be determined by commercial considerations. Such interconnection would, of course, only proceed subject to the findings of an appropriate feasibility study and the required environmental impact statement process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Chapter 5&mdash;Economic Considerations</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The Committee accepts that the analysis carried out by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics examined the general economics of interconnection through a high voltage power line, and was not sufficiently detailed to draw conclusions about the specific case of Eastlink.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The Committee believes that, in the interests of good public relations, the power authorities involved should make available to the public a more detailed cost/benefit analysis of Eastlink." (Paragraph 5.23).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> No Commonwealth action required&mdash;the Queensland Government has indicated that interconnection along the "Eastlink" route under consideration will not proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In assessing the economic benefits of the Eastlink proposal the ERC made references to the reported benefits as argued by the relevant state electricity <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> authorities, and the perceptions of the community to these estimated benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Advice from the relevant state agencies indicated that the 500 MW interconnection would eliminate the need for about 400 MW new capacity in Queensland and approximately 350 MW in New South Wales, and would have deferred the need for major new generating capacity until after the turn of the century. As an indication of these benefits, the elimination of 750 MW of potential gas turbine plant has been estimated by those agencies to provide a saving of around $500 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Grid interconnection forms an important component of the national electricity market being introduced under the auspices of the Council of Australian Governments (COAG). The competition policy reforms endorsed by COAG at its meeting on 11 April 1995 are expected to deliver potential benefits to the nation amounting to an increase in real annual GDP growth of around $23 billion. The electricity reforms are projected to deliver over 20% of these benefits, or some $5.0 billion in additional real GDP growth. The Commonwealth strongly supports grid interconnection, if economically and environmentally viable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In recent years, the Australian electricity industry has undergone significant reforms which have resulted in marked increases in efficiency. It is recognised that further significant gains can be achieved through the introduction of competition. The present reforms are directed at achieving greater efficiency and industry competitiveness, more efficient use of resources, lower electricity prices, greater choice for customers, and enhanced domestic and international performance. Competition is considered the most effective driving force to achieve these objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While not specific to Eastlink, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics has undertaken studies that have confirmed national benefits of grid interconnection. The Commonwealth Government welcomes the ERC's endorsement of this assessment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is worth noting that the EIS terms of reference specifically required an assessment of the economic benefits of the Eastlink proposal. A comparison of Eastlink's economic benefits and those associated with other options to meet Queensland's electricity requirements (including alternative power sources, alternative technologies and demand management) is also specified. The relevant requirements are detailed in Attachment No. 2, Parts A and B of the EIS terms of reference (at Annex A).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The issue of whether more detailed cost/benefit analyses for Eastlink, or those related to future interconnection options, should be released is a matter for the relevant New South Wales and Queensland agencies to decide.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has continuing obligations under the Climate Change Convention to provide an inventory of greenhouse gas emissions and sinks. The development of that inventory is jointly undertaken by the Commonwealth and the States under arrangements that evolved out of the National Greenhouse Response Strategy.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As jurisdictional responsibility for the electricity supply industry rest with the states it naturally falls to the responsible state jurisdictions to include an assessment of electricity industry developments such as grid interconnections when undertaking greenhouse gas inventory reporting.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth Government notes that the environmental benefits from the Eastlink proposal could arise from the sharing of reserve electricity capacity, the reduced need for additional power generation plant, and the energy savings resulting from the more efficient use of energy resources.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The anticipated greenhouse impact of Eastlink in the context of a competitive electricity market was assessed as one in which emissions are lower than otherwise would have been the case, but difficult to quantify at this stage.

At the same time, the overall environmental performance of power generation capacity continues to improve.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Electricity retailers are already seeking a competitive advantage by promoting innovative schemes aimed at encouraging development of renewable/alternative electricity generation. Appropriate grid access and pricing policies will lead to moresensible patterns of energy use, and by delivering non-distortionary price signals will encourage greater use of renewables, cogeneration and remote area power systems where they are cost effective.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth welcomes the communities' enthusiasm for renewable energy, and the indications that the community is prepared to utilise renewable based technologies that are currently <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3932"> economic and available. The Commonwealth recently provided support for a Co-operative Research Centre on Renewable Energy, part of which is to be located in Queensland. This provides a clear signal that continued development of such technologies will play a significant role in meeting Australia's future energy requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The use of renewable sources of energy are sometimes limited by intermittent availability, which can cause operational problems when they are used on a large scale.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Woodley's Minority Report</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Given the enormous amount of money which will be expended on Eastlink, the Democrats believe the governments involved should reconsider their commitment to the proposal until such time as the concerns outlined in the report, and in these additional comments have been adequately investigated. Such investigations must be open to public input and scrutiny."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> No Commonwealth action required&mdash;the Queensland Government has indicated that interconnection along the "Eastlink" route under consideration will not proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The issues raised in Senator Woodley's additional recommendation have largely been covered in responding to the recommendations of the principal Report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Eastlink environmental impact statement was based on terms of reference that specifically address the communities' concerns. A decision by the New South Wales and Queensland Governments on whether to commit the $300 m construction cost for the project were to have been made after completion of the feasibility study, which included the environmental impact statement. This is consistent with Senator Woodley's recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the possibility of adverse health impacts of EMFs cannot as yet be disproved, the Commonwealth considers that exposure to EMFs should be minimised as far as practicable. This is consistent with the ERC recommendation on this matter, particularly with reference to maintaining the policy of `prudent avoidance'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Woodley supports suggestions that the National Grid Management Council (NGMC) is a commodity vendor trying to sell more electricity as opposed to the development of energy services market. The NGMC, which is an independently chaired inter&hyphen;jurisdictional advisory body, has produced a report "Demand Management and Energy Efficiency in the Competitive Market" (February 1995) which demonstrates its efforts in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> identifying and progressing demand side reforms. As a specific example, recommendation 3 in the NGMC report states:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"[The NGMC recommends] That Governments support the development of a robust competitive energy efficiency services industry through:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> continuing existing programs and introducing appropriate new programs and initiatives that facilitate this outcome;</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">These arrangements should be introduced at the commencement of the competitive electricity market as part of the transitional arrangements."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth Government supports the recommendations of the NGMC report and will work with the States and Territories in relevant fora to achieve their implementation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NGMC also notes that the key objectives of the national market reforms are twofold:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> encouraging the most efficient, economical and environmentally sound development of the electricity industry consistent with key national and State policies and objectives</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> to provide a framework for long-term least cost solutions to meet future power supply demands including the appropriate use of demand management.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In its report the NGMC suggests that the key principles in achieving these broad objectives is the delivery of energy services to customers in a competitive environment at least cost. Attaining this least cost outcome requires equal consideration of both supply-side and demand-side options in meeting customer needs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Least cost" is further defined as the least cost from the perspective of society as a whole, rather than from the perspective of any one participant in the electricity supply industry. The cost of environmental externalities are not yet included in the definition of "least costs" as it is suggested that this issue should be the subject of government policy decisions across all energy forms, not just electricity. The Commonwealth acknowledges that development of a vigorous energy services sector is expected to facilitate this least cost approach through the competitive national electricity market.</PARA>

Prior to the last state election and prior to the Mundingburra by&hyphen;election in Queensland, the Borbidge government made a great fist of the fact that it was going to reject the Eastlink power connection between New South Wales and Queensland, and it got of lot of support for that. Having done that and having moved part of the connection a few kilometres to the west of the route for Eastlink around Gatton, that government has now decided to go ahead with another high voltage powerline in a high density residential and small farms area.

There is, through this report, an opportunity to look at that proposal again, but suffice it to say that the original proposal was being pushed ahead without due environmental assessment. There was trespassing across wild country, including the habitat of the rare and endangered red goshawk near Gatton, and through some magnificent country in the border ranges region to the east of Tenterfield, without proper assessment and to the great alarm of those people who value the ecosystems of these areas. Moreover, it was not accompanied by a judicious assessment of the energy&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Everything that is said in here is a matter of opinion, Senator. If you disagree, you will have the opportunity to speak afterwards and I will be pleased to hear your erudite contribution to this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing that has been missing from this debate is a proper assessment of the energy efficiency alternatives in Queensland. Neither Labor nor conservative governments in that state are properly able to get their minds around these as the best alternative. They have been looking at Tully&hyphen;Millstream, at thermal alternatives and even, in the back of some people's minds, the nuclear option as an alternative to piping electricity from the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> New South Wales grid north into Queensland. By far the best and cheapest option and the best job generator is energy efficiency whereby those industries in Queensland, as elsewhere, can save up to 40 per cent of the current consumption of electric power through simple, judicious, technical care and investment. I use as my authority the world&hyphen;renowned Rocky Mountains Institute&mdash;if the report disagrees with that&mdash;which comes down with a different point of view from this report. The senator opposite has had the opportunity to read that report, but I have not as it has just been tabled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a repeated failure of government, a repeated failure of bureaucracies and, certainly, a repeated failure of the energy utilities throughout this country to look at that option, which, by the way, produces cheaper electricity and has not only minimal impact on the environment but also environmental advantages. It means there is less leakage of energy and less wastage of power into the environment and certainly it obviates the need for alternative sources of power to be built to supply future needs of power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Economically, employment wise and environmentally, the energy efficiency option ought to be brought forward and does away with the need for the debate on the capital&hyphen;expensive and environmentally negative options such as Eastlink. That is something I intend to pursue in the Senate. As I said, the Greens in Queensland have fought long and hard to have that option brought up. It may be dismissed by a report like this, but then, I guess, even a report like this has not counselled global wisdom like that from the Rocky Mountains Institute in coming to the conclusions it has.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had not intended to speak at this stage on this particular report, but the comments of Senator Brown make it imperative that some things are actually corrected. Senator Brown was not in this parliament when this inquiry took place. The inquiry took place because of a motion that was brought forward from Senator Woodley.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Brown makes broad statements, saying, for example, that we did not consult <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3939"> widely or we did not consult internationally. Let me tell you, Senator Brown, that we had experts from both sides of the fence&mdash;wide-ranging opinions&mdash;from people who came in from overseas specifically to give evidence to this inquiry. This report that was brought down by the committee, which I chaired at the time, was, apart from a very small minority report by Senator Woodley, which highlighted one or two other issues, a unanimous report by the members of this Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing that Senator Brown does not understand is that we have got a response from the government in a far quicker time than we got a response from the former government on many of the matters that were reported on by the committee that I chaired. I think specifically of CSIRO. The previous government refused to comment on the report or respond to the report. The current government has already done that, and the response was made available to members of the committee within the past week or two. That was a report that the previous government failed to respond to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In response to the unanimous recommendations of this committee, which included three members of the then opposition, two of the then government and Senator Woodley, there is only one of the recommendations in the whole of the report that this government says that it does not support, and that is for a variety of reasons. The recommendation was that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee questions the practice of carrying out an environmental impact assessment of a proposal when alternatives have not been included in the detailed Environment Impact Statement and when siting of the line is clearly going ahead before the Environment Impact Statement is complete.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the only recommendation, amongst a large number of recommendations, that the government does not support, and there was a reason for that. It was not supported because consideration of Eastlink alternatives was an important element of the Eastlink environment impact assessment process which was being conducted in accordance with the relevant state and Commonwealth legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apart from that one area the government says that it does not support, it supports the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> recommendations that were put forward by the inquiry or, alternatively, says that it is not responsible as a Commonwealth government for the particular recommendations and so no Commonwealth action is required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to refute the comments that you have made, Senator Brown. I think it would pay you to read the response of the government to that report before you make a speech rather than afterwards because you might find that the response covers many of your concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Woodley says that certain things have taken place since the report was brought down. Things that have taken place since the report was brought down are not matters that the government was intending to respond to because the government response was to the unanimous recommendations of that report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was a good example of a reference to a committee, which was handled in a very short time because of the urgency that was required because of potential work that was going to take place. We held extensive public hearings over a very short time. This is an example of how Senate committees can work for the betterment of this chamber and for the people who made the representations to us. It was certainly done with far more effort to come out with unanimous recommendations than some similar committee references that I have been on in more recent times&mdash;the IR bills, to suggest just one of those.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the government's response because, in today's terms, it has been quick; it has been adequate. The government has responded to and supported practically all of the recommendations that were brought forward by that committee in their report to this Senate.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report which I have just tabled deals with the implementation of rockfall risk reduction strategies in the Kampong residential area in Flying Fish Cove, Christmas Island.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Kampong is at sea level and is overlooked by a steep cliff which rises to 180 metres.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The danger of loose boulders from the cliff face endangering lives and property has been known for some time; numerous incidents have been reported.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A landslide risk assessment, carried out by specialist consultants following a boulder weighing several tonnes coming to rest in close proximity to a residential unit, highlighted the risk.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Advice from the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department demonstrated the Commonwealth's responsibility to implement appropriate risk reduction strategies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of particular concern are two Commonwealth&hyphen;owned, high density, residential blocks&mdash;408 and 412.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The consultant's report attached the greatest risk of fatality to residents of these blocks. Under the Christmas Island redevelopment program, the Government has allocated nearly two million dollars for the construction of rockfall barriers, of modern sophisticated design, adjacent to these blocks. The barriers will stop the equivalent of a ten tonne truck travelling at fifty kilometres per hour.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because of the need to proceed with the work before the forthcoming wet season, the Committee agreed to the immediate construction of the barriers. This will reduce the level of risk substantially.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has also recommended that before this December, the Department of the Environment, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Sport and Territories&mdash;DEST&mdash;should have ready a rockfall risk management plan for Flying Fish Cove.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The plan should identify events, document responses, assign responsibilities amongst various organisations, research, monitor and increase the community awareness of risks and dangers. Simulated exercises should be undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This reference was somewhat unusual in one respect; instead of a definitive proposal, DEST presented the Committee with a range of strategies&mdash;five in all&mdash;which provide risk reduction measures, the construction of fences and barriers and the provision of alternative accommodation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All would involve expenditure by the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DEST were unwilling to identify a preferred strategy. The consultant who made the risk evaluations was therefore asked by the Committee to make recommendations appropriate to the circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reliance on expert advice was seen by the Committee as the most prudent course to follow. I should mention here that the consultant has many years experience both in Australia and overseas in landslide investigation, coastal geomorphology and geological studies of civil and mining projects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was clear from community reactions that the most pressing need on Christmas Island is the availability of land for private development. The Committee has made a number of recommendations designed to reduce risks from rockfalls and to hasten the release of land. If implemented, they will substantially reduce the need for the Commonwealth to continue investing large sums in housing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, I should mention the Christmas Island Boat Club, which has premises in what is seen as a high risk area. The premises were subjected to a potentially catastrophic event in 1972 involving several large boulders. The consultant recommended that the premises be demolished.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has agreed to this, but has also recommended that a new safer site be found for the club and that the construction costs for a new building be wholly or partially funded from the Community Benefit Fund.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In responding to this debate, let me say briefly that we on the opposition side argue that the case against the disallowance has not been made. We have had a last&hyphen;minute backdown by the government, signalled yesterday by Senator Vanstone, but we do not see that as in any way addressing the fundamental issues that have been raised in this debate, issues of access to justice and issues of access to people's rights in our legal system. We have had a last&hyphen;minute backdown, but it is one that is not good enough, in terms of both the magnitude and the individual fees involved. It is a backdown which still embodies a very large increase on the fees that currently apply in our legal system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As has been rightly indicated by the government, we increased fees at the start of this year, but I alert senators to the fact that when we did increase fees earlier this year our formula was based on a CPI adjustment basis. What we have here is something which has absolutely no relationship to CPI adjustment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the magnitude of the backdown, when the increase in fees drags some $72 million out of those in the Family Court system and some $32 million out of those who find themselves in the Federal Court system, the level of the negotiating position put up by Senator Vanstone is not good enough. In fact, one problem is that we have had no indication from the government as to the level of the reduction of the slug they will impose on individuals using the court system. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> There is some feeling that it might be as high as 15 per cent or 20 per cent, but in the absence of statistics all we can do, once again, is look at the individual instances involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has also argued that we need to somehow relate our fee structure to the fee structure imposed by the states. No doubt the consuming public, those who are in the court system, would not try to work out some complicated formula between state and federal court systems and their fees; they would look at it in terms of what they have to pay. What they have to pay is going to be a lot more than what they are paying now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For instance, in the Family Court system, even if you factor in the reductions that have been offered by Senator Vanstone you are still talking about at least $1,700 for a typical family law case. At the moment one has to pay only $368. If you take into account the reductions that have been announced by the government, we are still talking about 4&half; times more than what is currently being paid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at the Federal Court system generally, at people pursuing small business claims, you are still talking of them having to pay over $10,000 in court fees and charges, whereas at the moment the current fee is only over $1,000&mdash;a $1,600 application fee down to $1,200 with the first day free in court and whatever, the hearing fee down from $2,000 to $1,600 and so on. You will still find yourself paying $10,000 for your piece of the court action as opposed to $1,108 now. It is a 1,000&hyphen;fold increase for a small business claim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> And it goes on. For a review of government decisions, where at the moment people pay less than $1,000, in the future an individual trying to fight the government&mdash;for instance, over their pension payments, over an FOI act, over a tender, or whatever&mdash;will be paying over $3,500. At the moment they are paying only $984. We do not think the offer made by the government is good enough. We do not think the offer goes anywhere near the sorts of considerations that need to apply in the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">User pays is not appropriate. We have had this argument out. The fact that people will <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3942"> have to pay so much to access their rights I think is unconscionable. I am not the only one who thinks that. As I said yesterday, the highest ranking judicial officer in this country, Chief Justice Gerard Brennan, has also made it very clear that, with respect to user pays:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that profoundly mistakes the constitutional function of the judicial power of the State which, as I have said, is to apply the rule of law in resolving disputes and thereby preserving the peace, order and good government of society.</PARA>
<PARA>As I said yesterday, the exemption is one that really does not help us all that much. I do welcome the commitment in respect of the unlawful dismissal applications and applications which previously were available through the industrial relations system but in the future will have to be pursued in the Federal Court, but I do say that we will be looking very carefully to make sure that any claim for unlawful dismissal, whether it is in the Federal Court or the commission, will not have to incur anything more than the fee that that claim has had to incur in the past, not just in the arbitration system but also in the Federal Court system. There may in fact be a loophole there we are going to focus on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am a bit concerned that maybe the government has made some inroads in terms of their negotiations, negotiations which I said at the start are not as acceptable to us as they would appear to be at first viewing. They are not as acceptable because they do not reduce the impact of fees and charges in a manner that is appropriate. They still embody astronomical increases in claims, whether it is in the Family Court system or whether it is in the general federal court system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On this particular note, in respect of one aspect of the disallowance resolutions&mdash;that is, the one that goes to the question of claims under the Native Title Act&mdash;the government has made no concession. I would have thought it totally appropriate for them to have made a concession, particularly in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I draw the Senate's attention to the fact that, with respect to native title, there is going to be an increase in fees. With respect to the AAT, there is going to be an increase of some $2 million or $3 million over four years. With respect to the High Court, there is going to be <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> an increase of some $2 million over four years. I would have thought these particular increases in fees, exorbitant as they are, should not go ahead. With that, I close the debate.

<PARA>The events of the Port Arthur massacre were a horrid reminder of the brutality that can exist in our society. Port Arthur was an event that shook this nation to its very soul. In fact, it forced us to rethink the direction in which our nation was heading. In so doing, it actually put in place a particular process that led to the agreement establishing uniform national gun laws, an agreement which was concluded on 10 May this year. This was an outcome that Labor had worked hard to achieve in government and an outcome that we were very happy to give bipartisan support to in opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An important part of the new national gun laws is the national amnesty, an amnesty that is already up and running in a number of states and territories. The aim of that amnesty was to encourage as many gun owners as possible to hand in their prohibited weapons&mdash;to choose voluntarily to comply with the new laws. Given the considerable anger and the distrust of the government amongst some gun owners, this was never going to be an easy task. It was a task that was going to have to be handled sensitively and by the best advertising campaign possible. It was something that politics should never have played a part in. Unfortunately, it is quite apparent that this has not been the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The evidence which I will set out in the next few minutes clearly shows that advisers close to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) interfered with the tender process that led to the awarding of the national gun laws advertising contract to the firm DDB Needham Adelaide, a firm close to both the Liberal Party and the advisers concerned. In so doing, those advisers and this government have not only sought at the first available opportunity to corrupt the tender process to benefit their mates but, and more importantly, they put an advertising campaign, the success of which is fundamental to the national interest, in the hands of a firm which, according to the independent evaluation, is simply not up to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3944"> the job. As a result, the success of the desperately needed uniform national gun laws has been put in jeopardy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will now explain how this sleazy episode eventuated. On 4 June this year, the federal cabinet agreed that the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Jull) and the Attorney-General (Mr Williams), following consultation with the Prime Minister, would conduct an advertising campaign in support of the national gun amnesty. In July 1996 the Office of Government Information and Advertising, together with the Attorney-General's Department and the Commonwealth Law Enforcement Board, issued a creative agency brief for the national gun control public education campaign. The purpose of the campaign was clearly stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To design a creative advertising and media strategy to explain, promote and encourage voluntary compliance for the Australian wide gun amnesty.</PARA>
<PARA>The brief stated that the government had allocated $2 million to cover `all communication activities until the conclusion of the national gun amnesty on 30 June 1997'. The brief also set out three key objectives of the campaign: one, to promote and encourage voluntary compliance with the gun amnesty; two, to explain clearly which firearms are banned and which ones are restricted under licensing categories; and, three, to promote and encourage the surrender of unnecessary, illegal firearms. The brief was circulated to some 200 advertising agencies and marketing firms, all of which were contained on the register, maintained by OGIA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been advised&mdash;I raised this in my question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Hill) on Tuesday this week&mdash;that DDB Needham, Adelaide was not on this register as at 30 June this year. I have also been advised that the Prime Minister's chief political adviser, Mr Grahame Morris, contacted Ms Cathi Moore, the Assistant General Manager of OGIA, and asked that DDB Needham, Adelaide be added to the list of four firms initially asked to make a pitch for the contract&mdash;the first dose of interference. Senator Hill, on behalf of the government, had the opportunity on Tuesday to deny both of these matters. He chose not to. In fact, he <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> did not even have the decency to take the matters on notice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We then move to 8 August, when five firms, including the imposed DDB Needham, were asked to make a pitch. Representatives from the offices of the Prime Minister, the Minister for Administrative Services, OGIA, the Attorney&hyphen;General, the Attorney-General's Department and the Commonwealth Law Enforcement Board were present. Mr Morris attended the meeting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As is standard practice, all of the presentational materials were then taken from the five bidders and were submitted for market testing by independent assessors&mdash;Elliott and Shanahan research. The testing consisted of target group analysis of the messages contained in the advertising campaign. They had 13 group discussions across eight locations in New South Wales and Queensland. They were conducted in urban areas, in rural towns and amongst our farming community. The groups were made up of gun owners, both males and females, and partners of gun owners&mdash;all over the age of 18.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">DDB Needham's campaign theme was `Gun control: it's time to bite the bullet'. To say that this pitch was not warmly received by the target group would be a major understatement. Elliott and Shanahan, the independent assessors contracted by the government, concluded that DDB Needham's pitch `generated considerable anger because of the emotion of the approach'. They said that it `resulted in claims of non-compliance' with participants reacting by `digging their heels in'. Elliott and Shanahan noted that the pitch produced `a very emotionally charged response which always elicited a negative response'. They said that overall DDB `received the most negative response' of the five.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the response of some members of the discussion groups better expressed their reactions. One described the DDB proposal as kids stuff; another said, `It's overboard.' Another described it as a `kick in the guts'. More graphically, one member was quoted as saying, `No f. . . ing way. You can take that and stick it up your . . . .' This is the evaluation. This is the response.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3945">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">OGIA, in its advice to government from their assessment of DDB's submission, noted that it `barely met the requirements of the brief'. They went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In its submission DDB have not displayed strong application of critical logic or consistent application of communications theory in their submission.</PARA>
<PARA>So, basically, they failed. They failed the test of the target groups. They failed the test of the evaluation. OGIA also noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DDB Needham have suggested an unlikely communications solution to the task at hand . . . delivering a highly emotional creative strategy.</PARA>
<PARA>They also said, `DDB have not demonstrated a strong understanding of the creative task' and showed a `lack of attention to detail.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All these assessments are part of the documentation available to the government, documentation and evaluations sought for and paid for by the government. It is also understood that the Attorney-General's Department and the Commonwealth Law Enforcement Board also conducted separate evaluations of each of the bids, and they were equally as scathing of the quality of the campaign suggested by DDB Needham as OGIA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to look at the comparisons. It would be valuable for the Senate to understand the quality of some of DDB's competitors. For example, after the initial assessment, John Bevins was ranked first. Elliott and Shanahan concluded that their campaign&mdash;the theme was `Amnesty: once and for all'&mdash;received `the most positive response across all groups'. It was `non-threatening and non-contrived' and achieved a `positive reaction' to its `matter-of-fact approach'. That is a stark contrast to the DDB evaluation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The comments made by the test groups once again supported the conclusion. One person said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is down to earth whereas the other ones are trying to give you a threatening image and they turn you off.</PARA>
<PARA>Another said, `They're not playing on any emotions.' Another one of the target groups said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All the information is pretty clear. You can see what you can't have and you can see who can own a gun. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>So what is very clear is that John Bevins's submission was seen as not just better but highly superior by all those who independently assessed it&mdash;OGIA, Elliott and Shanahan and even the test groups. What can also be clearly seen is that DDB Needham were not up to scratch in any sense at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 23 August OGIA wrote to John Bevins Advertising advising of the arrangements for the Ministerial Committee on Government Communications to be held on Tuesday, 10 September 1996. The role of the ministerial committee was to make the final determination as to which tender was to be preferred. It is curious that in that letter OGIA informed John Bevins that only two tenderers had been short&hyphen;listed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, just a few days later in a subsequent letter dated 2 September, just over a week before the ministerial committee met, John Bevins got another letter from OGIA. This time they were told that three agencies had been short&hyphen;listed. Why was it now three and not two? The answer is pretty simple: in the interim Mr Morris, chief political adviser in the Prime Minister's office, contacted OGIA again and insisted that DDB Needham be included on the short list again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This brings us to the meeting of the ministerial committee that occurred on 10 September 1996. The committee currently has five sitting members: the Minister for Administrative Services, Senator Minchin, Mr Petro Georgiou, Mr Grahame Morris and, in relation to each advertising campaign, the relevant minister. In this case, of course, it would have been and was the Attorney&hyphen;General.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 10 September 1996 Mr Williams, as he stated in the House of Representatives today, was not able to attend as he was involved in a cabinet meeting. He sent in his place one of his advisers, Ms Melanie Granger, an adviser who had been with him in opposition. Mr Williams also invited the New South Wales Minister for Police, Mr Whelan, and the ACT Attorney&hyphen;General, Mr Gary Humphries, to attend. They were invited to represent the interests of the other state and territory police ministers, obviously those with a very direct and clear interest in the matter due to the nature of the campaign. They had a very close <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3946"> working relationship with the national gun amnesty. However, it is important to note that neither Mr Whelan nor Mr Humphries were voting members of the committee; they were there in an advisory capacity only.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The meeting commenced at about 5.30 p.m. Departmental agency officials were present. The initial plan was to hear the final pitches for the advertising contract and to determine which tender would be successful before moving on to the public relations contract. Following the pitches for the advertising contract, it was clear that the initial discussions favoured John Bevins Advertising. However, after a side discussion between the Attorney-General's adviser, Ms Granger, and Grahame Morris, Ms Granger left the room for a short period and returned saying, `Daryl wants DDB Needham.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is somewhat in conflict with what the Attorney-General told the House of Representatives today. It is not in conflict to the extent that Ms Granger left the room and saw him. But the Attorney&hyphen;General wants to wipe his hands of any involvement. He claims that he gave no indication at all. But Ms Granger went back and said, `Daryl wants DDB Needham.' It soon became apparent that the decision was unlikely to be reached quickly and, accordingly, the committee adjourned for dinner, then went on to hear the pitches for the PR contract and then to reach a decision on the advertising contract. So this was the process that was followed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note that at about 9.30 that night, four hours later, an officer from OGIA then rang the representative of John Bevins. The representative was advised that the field had been reduced to two but that the final decision was `vociferously being debated'. The OGIA officer went on to say that it was `not looking good' and that John Bevins's prospects did not `have much to do with the quality of their work'. Four hours later, John Bevins was told, essentially, `Your quality is pretty good but you're not looking too good and it's got nothing to do with the quality of your work.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the pitches for the public relations contracts were concluded at about 10 p.m., something quite extraordinary happened: the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> committee then proceeded to do their work basically in the dark. They kicked out the public servants; they kicked out the bureaucrats. They were not present. They were not allowed to be present. No minutes were kept at that stage; no records were kept. There was no public accountability because they were up to a dirty act and they wanted to make sure that there were no public servants around to witness it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to what happened next, we only know some of the details. At about 11 p.m., as a result of his disgust at the process that was being adopted and because he believed that the fix was well and truly on, Mr Whelan left the meeting to return to Sydney. The next public signal was at 12.10 a.m. when the staff of OGIA were informed that DDB Needham had won the contract.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, the great dark horse in this race for the advertising campaign, a company that only gave a sales pitch because of the intervention of Mr Morris from the Prime Minister's office&mdash;a pitch that was ranked last, fifth out of five, but which was miraculously short&hyphen;listed after further intervention by Mr Morris, a pitch that was ranked third on a short list of three and of which it was said `barely meets the requirements of the brief' and which had received `the most negative response overall'&mdash;jumped from being a non-starter to fifth, to third, to first. You would not have been expected to believe that DDB could have won it at the start. If you had put a bet on DDB at the start, it would have been a pretty exciting race to watch and it would have won at extremely long odds.</PARA>

When questioned by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper on 31 September 1996 as to why DDB Needham had won the contract, the Attorney-General, Mr Williams, denied that he had favoured DDB. If that is correct, why then did his adviser, Ms Granger, indicate otherwise at that meeting on 10 September? At the meet ing was she acting alone; was she acting with the Attorney-General's authorisation and express approval; or is she just going to take the rap?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, on 1 October 1996 the Prime Minister, curiously enough, admitted that three advisers on the committee&mdash;Senator Minchin, Mr Georgiou and Mr Morris, as the Prime Minister claims&mdash;had voted for another firm. If both Mr Williams and the Prime Minister are right, then at least three out of the five members of the committee did not vote for DDB Needham. This raises two direct questions: first, who did vote for them; and, secondly, how did they end up getting the contract if the majority of the committee did not vote for them?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, it is not clear whether either Mr Williams or Mr Howard are telling the truth. On the same day that Mr Howard made his comments, the ACT Attorney-General, Mr Humphries, said on ABC radio that the decision to award the contract to DDB Needham had been unanimous. They might have organised the fix but they did not organise the cover-up afterwards. Who is telling the truth: Mr Howard, Mr Williams, Mr Humphries, or none of them? Why was DDB Needham&mdash;and you have to ask this&mdash;the beneficiary of this government's largess? Why did DDB Needham, with no merit, get the preferred treatment coming from nowhere in the race and finishing up in front? The answer is pretty simple: DDB Needham has close connections with the Liberal Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The principals of the firm, Mr Ted Horton, Mr Toby Ralph and Mr John King, worked on the 1996 federal election campaign. DDB Needham had also worked on state election campaigns for the Liberal Party. In fact, in their respective capacities as state directors of the Liberal Party in South Australia and Victoria, Senator Minchin, Mr Morris and Mr Georgiou had all worked with and had all given work to DDB Needham.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To tackle the argument that the Prime Minister tried to use this afternoon in the House of Representatives on the other side, the Labor Party has absolutely no problem with a firm with Liberal Party connections winning government contract work, providing <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that firm is the firm best suited to perform the job and wins the tender process fairly and squarely. But that is clearly what did not happen in this particular case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us get an overview of the impropriety. Let us get an overview of the corruption of the process here. I have already discussed how DDB Needham's pitch was patently deficient for this crucial national advertising campaign. I have already discussed how Mr Morris interfered in the tendering process to ensure that Needham received consideration that it simply did not deserve. I have also discussed how Needham seems to have won the contract despite the fact that the majority of the committee claim not to have voted for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just as importantly, Senator Minchin, Mr Morris and Mr  Georgiou, the apparatchiks of the Liberal Party, should have absented themselves from the decision to award this contract on the basis that there was at least a clear perception that they had a conflict of interest, if not an actual conflict of interest, given that each of them had previously awarded contracts to DDB Needham and had worked with them in a very close, personal and political capacity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is clearly the case in relation to the person who actually voted for DDB Needham, but it is even the case for the other two. They should have exempted themselves, and that is very clear. When a judge or other decision maker exempts themselves from a decision on the basis of conflict of interest, they do so not just because of any perception or actual conflict that may arise from the ultimate decision; they do so because it is critical that the very process must not be tainted by that conflict or that perception of conflict. Clearly, regardless of who voted for DDB Needham, the contact of Senator Minchin, Mr Morris and Mr Georgiou is deserving of censure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does not end there. There is more. Since the tender was awarded, cabinet decided on 24 September to increase the amount of money available for the advertising campaign from $1 million to $3 million. This decision was made ostensibly to allow a television component for the campaign. It is no surprise that, in its pitch, DDB Needham, the favoured <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3948"> son of the Liberal apparatchiks, recommended a $2.88 million budget for the campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst I note and accept that the move to expand the campaign to provide a TV component was supported by Mr Whelan  and Mr Humphries, in the circumstances I think we are entitled to ask whether this tacky exercise was just as much about getting `more pork on your fork' as it was about the genuine interest of the advertising campaign. You have to ask whether the only reason this campaign received the extra $2 million was that the contract had been awarded to Liberal Party mates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regrettably, this was not the only contract fix engaged in by this government. I turn to the public relations contract. The PR contract in the same matter was also the subject of political interference. When the bureaucrats and the political advisers met on 8 August 1996 to settle the short list for the PR contract, only two firms were initially short-listed&mdash;only two firms, Senator Minchin. They were Hill and Knowlton and Turnbull Fox Phillips. That was on 8 August.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, less than a month later, on 7 September, those firms were advised that a third firm&mdash;Burson Marsteller&mdash;had also been short&hyphen;listed, once again thanks to the intervention, the interference and the corruption of the process by Mr Morris. The ultimate decision taken on 10 September 1996 to award the contract to Burson Marsteller is still a curious one. In its evaluation, for instance, OGIA described the Burson pitch in the following terms: `Whilst innovative, it is considered risky for the government.' The other short-listed firms' pitches were described by OGIA as being `sound and achievable'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once again, what we have here is a public relations contract, the awarding of which raises questions of why Mr Morris interfered from outside directly into the process and corrupted it. The reason once again is clear: Burson had strong connections with the Liberal Party. The final sales pitch was given by Jonathan Gaul, who has worked&mdash;Senator Minchin knows this; you are as guilty as hell on this one, Senator Minchin&mdash;on the committee of many Liberal campaigns, including <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> working in the party's national headquarters during the recent federal election campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to also note that the Burson bid relied upon research conducted by Mr Mark Textor. Mr Textor has conducted polling for the Liberal Party in many state and territory election campaigns&mdash;the Northern Territory for instance. He has been employed by the Liberal Party as a staffer and, most recently, he was the director of polling and research at the Liberal Party's federal secretariat. Most notably, Mr Textor is the person who is known for that shameful exercise during the 1995 Canberra by-election when he designed the Liberal Party's push polling campaign. So, once again, across the spectrum on a critical issue where bipartisan support is critical, we have political interference in a process that should have been only merits based.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a shabby affair to say the least. The government has a hell of a lot of explaining to do if it is to provide a rational explanation as to how a bid as poor as that submitted by DDB Needham Adelaide ever won this contract. There is compelling evidence through the estimates committees and in documentation that the government interfered in this tendering process to ensure that the advertising contract was undeservingly awarded to its mates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the concern goes way beyond the sniff of corruption that we have here. The decision to award this contract to DDB Needham has already had practical consequences. The advertising campaign, which was due to start on 1 October, has been delayed. The gun amnesty has commenced in a number of jurisdictions and there is no advertising campaign to support it. It has just about finished in Adelaide and there is no advertising campaign to support it. And why? Because DDB Needham was not ready. It had to go off and redesign its campaign. How can the government expect us to trust a company that was shown through the independent evaluation process to be unfit to conduct this campaign&mdash;a company which designed a campaign that not only did not encourage gun owners to hand in their weapons, but incited <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3949"> them to resist the amnesty and to bury their weapons in the backyard?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the interests of trying to fix up its mates with the old payback system, the government has placed in jeopardy one of the most important advertising campaigns ever conducted by an Australian government&mdash;just to reward its mates. The longer it goes on, the longer we get the dissembling, the more the government gets itself into trouble.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have put on record exactly what the evaluation said of DDB Needham. But what does Mr Jull, the Minister for Administrative Services, say through his spokesman?  He says that there is no reason to take action since he saw no flaw in the process. The whole process was corrupted. It is quite evident it was corrupted. You do not have to talk to the advertising industry to find that out. The documentation shows that. The minister sees no flaw in the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister also went on to say, laughingly I must submit, `DDB was selected for their overall strategy which was considered to be the soundest strategy.' It was a strategy which his department knocked back and his department and its independent contractors determined was the weakest. He says, `They had a strong creative team their strategy fitted well with the successful public relations firm Burson Marsteller.'  What a lot of rubbish! The team was not even known at the start. The evidence is quite clear. This firm should never have been in the ring, but the minister laughingly tries to defend them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has not just jeopardised the campaign but has sent the wrong message to a very important industry. The advertising industry has to be concerned because they are in great contractual relations with government and they have to have confidence in the process, but what confidence will they have now? I think the feeling in the advertising industry is best summed up by John Bevins in Sydney. They said that agencies would be `mad to pitch for government accounts the way the process is now'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have corrupted the process for your mates. You have jeopardised a very critical campaign&mdash;a campaign jeopardised not only by the political interference in it but also by <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> putting in a firm which was not ready to run when the amnesty took off. I think there is more than enough evidence here to indicate there was political interference by the apparatchiks of the Liberal Party deep in the heart of the Prime Minister's own office, with the Prime Minister's parliamentary secretary and Prime Minister's chief political adviser. They have corrupted the process. There is a need for a judicial inquiry and that is why the opposition has moved this motion this afternoon.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The actions of the Labor Party today really shows the depth of irrelevancy to which they have sunk since March. There are a number of very important issues in Australia that should be being debated today&mdash;things like the industrial relations legislation, unemployment and interest rates. What does the Labor Party do? Come up with a series of paragraphs in a motion on a matter which they have already trawled through at the estimates committees a couple of weeks ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They got half a paragraph in the newspapers a couple of weeks ago when they raised it at the estimates committee. I suspect that they are unhappy that they only got a couple of paragraphs on page 10. They are trying to resurrect it today hoping that they might get a better run. From the look of the press gallery, I am afraid they are out of favour there as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very pleased to participate in the debate to set the record straight, to get rid of come of the rewriting of history that Senator Bolkus tried to engage in in his presentation, and to show exactly what the facts were in relation to this particular contract. As all Australians know, the national firearms control education campaign is one of the most important public education campaigns ever undertaken by government. I do not think even the Labor Party could deny that. It follows on from an historic agreement that was reached by all Australian governments in May this year. Under that agreement, certain high powered firearms were to be banned and uniform national minimum standards on the availability, use, ownership and storage of firearms were to be introduced.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3950">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The launch phase of that national firearms control public education campaign is now under way. Its purpose is to explain the new laws to all Australians, and I think everyone agrees that is needed and necessary, and also to inform gun owners of their rights and obligations under those laws. To suggest that the government or the committee would jeopardise such an important campaign by fixing the results, as apparently the Labor Party is suggesting, detracts from that very historic agreement of all governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To claim that the selections were made on the basis of mates rather than merit is insulting, small minded and, most importantly, wrong. The simple fact is that both the successful advertising agency, DDB Needham, and the successful public relations agency, Burson Marsteller, were selected on the basis of merit. The committee selected DDB Needham because the agency offered the strongest creative team, because their overall approach best addressed the wide range of target audiences and because they provided the best fit with the successful public relations agency. The committee selected Burson Marsteller because the agency displayed the strongest grasp of the brief and the issues and because their proposed approach was more strategic and comprehensive than the other agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition has alleged that because members of the committee had dealings with members of DDB Needham this somehow translates into a conflict of interest. It is quite clear to everybody that there was absolutely no conflict of interest for any of the members of the committee. The decision involved no personal gain, financial or otherwise, for any member of the committee, unless you are suggesting that people on the committee have shares in DDB Needham, and if you are suggesting that perhaps you should be clearer in the allegation. It is of course quite incorrect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee brings together extensive experience in advertising. They have planned and implemented campaigns, judged pitches by a range of agencies and interpreted a variety of research results. They know how to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> exercise judgment and how to identify a winning campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I guess the Labor Party is a bit envious that the people on our committee have been very successful in their understanding of advertising. That is shown quite clearly by the results in South Australia. Are there any Labor Party people left in the South Australian state parliament? If there are, there are not many. Certainly there are none in Queensland. But the results in South Australia in the federal election show that people we have on our side, like my colleagues Senator Minchin, Mr Georgiou and Mr Grahame Morris, do have a real grasp of advertising. They understand it, understand it very successfully, and know how to put campaigns together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously they are on this committee which looks at advertising matters because we as a government want to make sure that the very best decisions are made and that Commonwealth taxpayers get the very best value for their money. The committee seeks the best result for the government of the Commonwealth and, in particular for this campaign, for everyone who will be affected by the campaign&mdash;the people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, the members of the committee would have dealt with a wide range of advertising agencies over the years&mdash;not just DDB Needham but a very wide range, as Labor Party people involved in advertising would have. Yet nobody has ever suggested that the committee should comprise members with no experience in this area or that agencies that have dealt with political parties should be excluded from government contracts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, it was our former colleague Graham Richardson, when asked about awarding John Singleton quite a lucrative contract&mdash;and I guess everyone knows that John Singleton has done most of the ALP advertising&mdash;who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not the case now, nor has it ever been, that an agency which has the account of a political party which is in government should be banned from receiving government advertising.</PARA>

He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is certainly true that John Singleton is a friend of mine, and he has been for a long time.</PARA>
<PARA>Graham Richardson did not think that that should bar him from working on that committee and awarding contracts to Mr Singleton. Yet the relationship there seems&mdash;and I do not really know&mdash;to be much closer than what is alleged by the opposition today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Former Senator Richardson did not consider it necessary to place himself at arms&hyphen;length from that decision. I think in answer to a question he said that he was relying on the fact that the other two members of the committee were apparently not as friendly with Mr Singleton so that made the decision all right, and it was a unanimous decision. That seemed to be okay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask the Senate: if there was no conflict of interest in 1989, what has changed? Why is there now a conflict of interest in exactly the same set of circumstances? The opposition, as is its wont, is trying to rewrite history. But by the end of this debate we want to make sure that the facts are on the record as to what did happen. If it was good enough in 1989, what has changed since that time?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much has been said by the opposition in its media releases about individual votes on the committee. Senator Bolkus mentioned it in his speech. I understand from the minister's office that is not the practice of the committee&mdash;nor would I imagine that it was the practice under the former government&mdash;for information to be divulged as to who voted for what. Given speculation about this issue, I am informed by the minister's office that the committee spent some time considering how best to manage the education campaign and which firm would represent the best fit with the selected public relations agency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I understand it, the three members of the committee who have been targeted by the Labor Party did not come to a unanimous decision; they did not vote as a bloc on the initial pitch. Following further consideration of these pitches, however, the committee, with the exception of Mr Whelan, was unanimous <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in its selection of DDB Needham. So it was a process, as I understand it&mdash;I obviously was not there&mdash;of discussions and initially those three did not vote as a bloc. At the end of the day there was a unanimous selection, with the exception of Mr Whelan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Whelan, as I understand it&mdash;and perhaps you can correct me&mdash;is a member of the Labor Party, isn't he? He is the New South Wales police minister. I think it is rather strange that, if there was going to be funny business going on as alleged by the opposition, why would this committee and the minister invite Mr Whelan, a Labor Party politician and a minister, into this particular meeting?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition makes much of the fact that the qualitative researcher, Elliot and Shanahan Research, did not recommend DDB Needham, and Senator Bolkus went on at some length about that. The facts are that the slogans and storyboards for all five agencies which pitched for the campaign were sent out for concept testing by Elliot and Shanahan Research. They held 13 discussion groups across Queensland and New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The slogans and storyboards proposed by four of the five agencies did not test well, yet the recommendation by Elliot and Shanahan Research that the John Bevins proposal be accepted appears to be based more on the fact that it was less likely to offend rather than having any particular merit. That to me&mdash;and I certainly have no expertise at all in the advertising area&mdash;seems to be a silly way to make recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the opposition very conveniently chooses to ignore is that the Elliot and Shanahan report indicates that the Bevins proposal was perceived as `a neutral announcement that elicited a neutral response'. Yet the report goes on to say in the summary of key findings that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result, the focus is the audience not the message; it is not what do our messages do to people, but what will people do with our messages?</PARA>
<PARA>There is nothing in the Elliot and Shanahan report that gave the committee confidence that the Bevins approach would generate compliance with the new laws.</PARA>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>Despite the fact that these statements seem to me to be a little bit contradictory, you do not have to be a great intellect to work out&mdash;and I am sure even Senator Bolkus could work out&mdash;that a neutral message that elicits a neutral response is hardly likely to deliver the outcomes that all Australians seek from this very important campaign on a very important issue. When assessing the proposals, the committee felt that the Bevins approach, whilst it did not offend anyone, contained no motivating factors and would not significantly advance the aims of the campaign. The committee felt that in order to be successful the Bevins approach would need to be boosted significantly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a committee of people who understand advertising, know what it is all about and know the best approach to adopt to get a response from the target audience. The overall strategy proposed by DDB Needham, however, was strong and the committee considered that some of the slogans should be modified, taking into account the research results.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition has also worked itself into a bit of a frenzy about what it considers to be the ranking of the proposals by the Office of Government Information and Advertising, OGIA. OGIA, in fact, did not rank the proposals at all. They provided the committee with an assessment of five proposals based on responses to the written brief, initial presentations to an assessment panel and the research results, which I have already mentioned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The OGIA assessments were, in fact, pretty damning about four of the five proposals. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Whilst the committee took these assessments into consideration, given that OGIA expressed reservations about most of the field, the committee made its decision primarily on the basis of the presentations made to it&mdash;not on some report on some written material but on the presentations made to the committee.

I will continue with the editor's comments which were in the Ad magazine&mdash;the trade magazine. The editor goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The problem is they&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>`they' is the Labor Party&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">don't really understand advertising and PR too well. Yes, many of the competing agencies will be peeved at having seemingly thrown money away in what appeared to be a fixed pitch. But they will also understand that often safe, neutral campaigns work to a degree. They give safe, neutral sorts of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3954"> results. And they give the client a nice warm feeling that nothing will go wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They will also know that risky ballsy campaigns often produce startling results.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What needs to be remembered is that too much research can lead to bland ads. The issue . . . is should you believe research. There is a growing backlash against it. By all means do it. But be sensible in interpreting the results.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what the industry says. They understand that there are certain impacts and results that you want to get out of this advertising. It is interesting that this trade magazine should say that and should so accurately describe the Labor Party in their pretty petty attack on this particular matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the short time available to me I just want to have a bit of a look through what happened under the former government. We know that Singleton has been around the Labor Party for some time and that he has done some pretty good work for them. As I have mentioned, Graham Richardson was pretty close friends with John Singleton. I do not necessarily suggest there was anything wrong in all the contracts that Singleton got from the previous government. I have mentioned that Singleton was a close friend of Graham Richardson at the time he was awarding contracts. He was awarded the pretty lucrative `Australia made' contract in 1986 and again in 1989.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The campaign had an advertising budget of $2.4 million, and the committee that made the selection was chaired by none other than Graham Richardson. He did not consider it necessary to remove himself when these sorts of things were being awarded to Mr Singleton. Mr Singleton got a fee of $33,000 from that 1986&hyphen;89 Australia made campaign and in 1989&hyphen;92 he got another fee of $240,000. Mr Singleton got a fee of $700,000 for the Qantas public share float. There seems to be a deathly silence over on the other side now. What happened to Graham Richardson with all these? What about the fact that Mr Singleton was the ALP man? He got another $124,000 from the Australia made campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about Rod Cameron? Can someone help me over there? What is he in the Labor Party? He is your permanent pollster, is he? Or used to be. He seems to have done pretty well out of the government with a&mdash;</PARA>

Of course, all the research projects that he was given this money for are things that just might have helped him in the advice that he might have given to the Labor Party in a number of campaigns.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the projects in more recent times that he was asked to poll are: environmental issues research; community attitudes to environmental issues; community attitudes to environmental issues again; youth attitudes Wave 5&mdash;after Wave 4, Wave 3, Wave 2 and Wave 1, which were done previously&mdash;perceptions of constitutional issues; and an opinion survey on national occupational health attitudes.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I have the time, I want to raise a couple of other things that Senator Bolkus said. Senator Bolkus made a lot of the fact that the advertising agency that finally got the campaign, Needhams, recommended an increase from $1 million to $2.8 million&mdash;I think that is what he said. He forgot to tell us that Bevins agency&mdash;which it seems he was supporting&mdash;recommended an increase in funding from $1 million to $3 million, which was how it turned out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apparently, I am told, all five of the agencies actually recommended that there be <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3955"> additional funding, but the recommendation the government took&mdash;the $1 million to $3 million&mdash;seems to be the one that Bevins agency promoted. Senator Bolkus went on at some length to suggest that, because Needham suggested $1 million up to $2.8 million, there was something quite improper about that. But he forgot to tell the Senate that all five agencies had apparently recommended more. The actual figures that we ended up with&mdash;$1 million to $3 million&mdash;were those recommended not by DDB Needham, but by Bevins.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another matter that I want to briefly cross. There was, apparently&mdash;according to Senator Bolkus&mdash;some real problem with the selection of the public relations agency Burson Marsteller. Isn't it true, though, that Mr Whelan, the Labor politician and New South Wales police minister&mdash;Senator Minchin might be able to confirm this&mdash;voted for them as well?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He did? It was a unanimous decision and Mr Whelan supported it. Senator Bolkus tried to mislead the Senate again by suggesting that it was because of some great conspiracy on the part of the Liberal members on the committee that this agency was picked. Mr Whelan&mdash;the Labor politician and New South Wales police minister&mdash;actually voted for it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Whelan must be either very stupid or, alternatively, like the rest of the committee he thought that their presentation was the best and that they were the most effective public relations agency to have in this job. I hope Senator Robert Ray explains that to us&mdash;that would be very interesting. I am sure Mr Whelan would not divulge any information on what happened at that meeting, but perhaps in a quiet moment you might ask him whether or not he supported that agency and why he did support it. Was it because it has some affiliation with the Liberal Party, as you have alleged? If it was, why would Mr Whelan want to help those people? Just perhaps Mr Whelan thought that that was the pitch, the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> best agency, and that they were in the best position to get across the government's program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am somewhat sad that the Labor Party are indulging themselves in this sort of material today. We have spent the whole day on these types of things. The real issues that confront Australia seem to be quite irrelevant to the Labor Party. They will not let us get on with the budget; they will not let us deal with the industrial relations bill, which, when passed, would do magnificent things for employment and for our export trade. The Labor Party prefer to try to mislead the Australian public by this exercise in political muckraking. There is absolutely no substance to the allegations they have made. They have not produced any facts before the Senate which would justify them and it is a pity they do not get on with the real job of doing something decent for Australia.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to a question from the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) today as to whether the Prime Minister stood by his statement on radio 6PR that `there had been a completely proper tendering process and there was nothing unethical about what had occurred' the Prime Minister answered, `Unless you know something I don't, yes.' Well, we do know something Mr Howard does not know.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue under discussion today raises grave doubts about the probity of the Howard government. It raises questions about conflict of interest and could well border on the edge of corruption. In the absence of an anti&hyphen;corruption body like the ICAC at a federal level, it is the duty of this Senate to pursue these matters. The Prime Minister, Mr Howard, has made much of his new standards that will operate under this government. Yet, at the very first test, a sleazy operation has been run to reward political mates&mdash;all funded by taxpayers' money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me outline how that has occurred. First of all, let us go through the Office of Government Information and Advertising's assessment of these proposals after the first pitch. I go to John Bevins Pty Ltd, which, quite <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3956"> clearly, was the one written up as the best. OGIA found that the strategy of John Bevins Pty Ltd&mdash;Amnesty: Once and For All&mdash;`demonstrated superior understanding of the communications task outlined in the brief'. The submission met the requirements of the brief very well and met the budget specified. It went on to say that the message represented `a creative solution which successfully delivers the key messages in a manner that will assist to defuse the emotionally based arguments from pro&hyphen;gun lobbyists'. Bevins included non&hyphen;English language press in their media schedule and OGIA found that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The nominated team from Bevins have experience working on state and Commonwealth government campaigns and have delivered high quality campaigns on time and within budget.</PARA>
<PARA>Compare and contrast what OGIA said about DDB Needham Adelaide. OGIA noted that its submission `barely meets the requirements of the brief' and that it was full of contradictions in their thinking. OGIA found that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DDB have not displayed strong application of critical logic or consistent application of communications theory in their submission.</PARA>
<PARA>Further they found that it was `difficult to assess DDB Needham's media plan as they did not include a detailed concept plan'. The submission was found to answer few requirements of the brief. It was considered doubtful that the television&hyphen;cinema commercial could be delivered on time or within the budget allocated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet a firm that gets this caning makes the short list. They miraculously go from fifth to third and I will explain later how they made it. They are put out to market, to qualitative research, to test the concepts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does Elliott and Shanahan&mdash;the body this government got to do this assessment&mdash;say about John Bevins:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most positive response across all groups.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clear neutral announcement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Relates to all people and does not stereotype.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Non&hyphen;threatening and not contrived.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Strong branding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It did not generate anger.</PARA>
<PARA>It said that attention was focused on the message about the amnesty and not what the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> laws are about. The research found that gun owners were less likely to knock this approach and it did not generate angry discussion amongst the participants about the pros and cons of the new laws. Let me quote what some of the participants in this poll said about Bevins:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is down to earth whereas the other ones are trying to give you a threatening image and they turn you off.</PARA>
<PARA>Another quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For anyone who couldn't understand or speak English, the pictures make it pretty clear what it's all about.</PARA>
<PARA>Elliott and Shanahan recommended the John Bevins proposal, `Amnesty: Once and For All'. It found that this approach `is likely to be the most effective in terms of the communication goals and in achieving the greatest compliance with the new laws'. Finally, the research found:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is likely to be the most effective communication approach essentially because it is non&hyphen;threatening, generates very little emotion, and is matter of fact and neutral in its tone. It does not challenge or confront the audience but it still generates interest and impact.</PARA>
<PARA>What did the same qualitative polling organisation have to say about the DDB Needham Adelaide proposal? The research showed that the DDB Needham proposal `Gun Control: It's Time to Bite the Bullet' generated considerable anger because of the emotion of the approach. The research indicated that the approach would result in non&hyphen;compliance with the laws and was seen as dictatorial and with government `coming to get you'. It was seen as an anti&hyphen;gun lobby approach and elicited the most negative response overall.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The research showed that gun owners rejected the approach proposed. It encouraged gun owners to fight the government and it was found to position the government in the most unfavourable light. The material was considered sexist and likely to create family squabbles. It was seen as threatening, challenging and extreme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why don't we go to some of the participants in these polls? One of them said, `It's kids stuff, isn't it?' Another said, `It's overboard.' Another said, `Kick in the guts; it's <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3957"> too standoverish. You have to bear in mind that we have just been charged and convicted for something we didn't do.' And another said, `To me, as a shooter, it turns me right off; it means anti&hyphen;gun control; it means gun user control.' Another said, `We have voted this government in; how much trust do we have in them? I haven't got any any more.' And the final one says&mdash;in deference to the Lyons foundation, I might moderate it: `No&mdash;expletive deleted&mdash;way. You can take that and stick it up your posterior.' Honourable senators will note that I have only paraphrased that last remark.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The prime ministerial guide on the key elements of ministerial responsibility states, for the benefit of those opposite:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ministers will obtain an advice from a range of sources, but primarily from their private office and their departments. There is clearly no obligation on ministers to accept advice put to them by public servants, but it is important that advice be considered carefully and fairly.</PARA>
<PARA>In the light of the above and considering the advice from OGIA and Elliott and Shanahan, can the Prime Minister really state that the agencies that pitched for the advertising contract were treated fairly? Was the advice from OGIA and Elliott and Shanahan carefully considered by the committee?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The key question in this is: how did DDB Needham Adelaide get on the list originally? There is great doubt whether they were ever on the original register of several hundred firms. However, the decision on this occasion to go for selective tendering was a sensible one&mdash;to pick out four or five to tender&mdash;because the assessment cost, if 20 or 100 firms had applied for this work, would have been prohibitive and a stupid expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have a look at the question of the 1995 billing rates for these firms: George Paterson Bates Brisbane, billing rate $30.6 million; Foote Cone and Belding Sydney, $55.4 million; John Bevins Advertising, $27.3 million; Grey Melbourne, $78.2 million; DDB Needham Adelaide, $5.8 million. Needhams are not in the same class as the other four firms. They do not sit with them; they stick out like a sore thumb. You have to ask: how <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in heaven's name did they get chosen? It is a very murky process, let me tell you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What happened on this occasion was that OGIA drew up suggestions. They had to put those suggestions to ministers and the final five firms emerged. I can tell the Senate that OGIA did not have Needhams on their list when they sent it to ministers. What happened on this occasion was that the Prime Minister's chief political adviser, Mr Grahame Morris, contacted the assistant manager of OGIA and requested that DDB Needham Adelaide be on the list. If anyone doubts this, just ask the Department of Administrative Services whether such a letter is on the file. Let those opposite deny that the chief political operator out of the Prime Minister's office put the fix in and got DDB Needham Adelaide put on this list when OGIA never considered them a worthy contender or in the same league as the other firms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After that, you get a short list drawn up&mdash;after everyone has come in and had their pitch, and I will come back to this later. A short list of two firms is drawn up: John Bevins Advertising and George Paterson Bates. That was to be the short list to do the second pitch. What happens? Chief political adviser Grahame Morris comes back on the scene. He agrees that Bevins is a pretty good bid and, just to make sure Bevins wins, he suggests that DDB Needham go on the list because they are like chalk and cheese&mdash;that the contrast would be enormous: they lob in a no&hyphen;hope firm in order to show how good the winning firm is going to be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following a process of qualitative testing carried out by Elliott and Shanahan, these firms happened to make their second pitch to the ministerial committee. The crucial point is that these firms are not supposed to change their pitch from the first pitch to the second pitch; otherwise all the qualitative research is useless. The only assumption we could ever have made was that this absolutely hopeless bid by Needhams must have improved massively on the second pitch. But you are not allowed to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, we have other evidence here now, and that is that Mr Wayne Kingston, the chairman of DDB Needham Australasia, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3958"> refutes this. Mr Kingston is a real straightshooter, a dead honest bloke. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 3 October, he said that his agency had made some amendments to its submission between the first and second pitches, but that these were minor. You cannot have it both ways. If the first pitch remains virtually the same as the second pitch, with only minor amendments, how could you possibly think of using this firm that is so bagged by OGIA and so destroyed by the Elliott and Shanahan research?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has happened subsequently, Needhams having won this contract, is that all that first and second pitch has been thrown out. DDB Needham Adelaide are now working on a new creative pitch. They have thrown out the bite the bullet campaign, I am told, and they are now working on a new campaign. What that means in terms of billing is that everyone only gets $5,000 a pitch and, if you do creative work post the pitch, you get paid full tote odds. Not only have the others been skun&mdash;and some of these bids have cost them up to $80,000 to put together&mdash;but now Needhams are going to get paid not $5,000 for their creative work but an enormous amount more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me come to the decision making day, because this is crucial to our argument. The ministerial committee began meeting at 5.30 p.m. The members of the committee present were: Mr Grahame Morris, chief political adviser to the Prime Minister; Mr David Jull, Minister for Administrative Services; Senator Nick Minchin, parliamentary secretary; and Mr Petro Georgiou, member for Kooyong. I would just like to take a moment to congratulate Mr Georgiou on being the first backbench member of this committee in its history. Then finally, because Mr Williams was unavailable due to going to cabinet, an absolutely proper excuse, Ms Melanie Granger, an adviser to him, represented his interests on this committee. Also present, as I think Senator Ian Macdonald said, were police ministers Whelan and Humphries and their staff. There were OGIA staff and staff from the Attorney-General's Department and related agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All the firms came in and made their pitch. Then Elliott and Shanahan came in and gave <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> their assessment in summary. The general view in the committee, as I understand it, was that Bevins were a mile in front. There was then a confab between Mr Grahame Morris and Ms Melanie Granger, who then left the room. From answers given in the House of Representatives today by Mr Williams, she put the case to the Attorney-General, Mr Williams, apparently gave him some papers, and he said, `I can't make up my mind. You'll have to do it for me.' What does Ms Melanie Granger do when she goes back inside the room? She utters the immortal words, `Daryl prefers DDB.' Who do we believe? The staffer or the minister? I believe the minister. I believe that the minister was telling the truth today that he gave his staffer no instructions and that she came back into the room and said, `Daryl prefers DDB,' on the basis that she was suborned by Mr Grahame Morris, chief political adviser to the Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, this throws great confusion into the meeting, and they determine, `We can't resolve it now. Let's take a dinner break. Let's hear the PR firm's pitch and we will come back and decide this matter later.' Of course, later in the evening all the OGIA officials leave the room and the decision is made, and they are informed at 10 minutes past 12 that the contract has gone to Needhams.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But here is the interesting point. At 9.30 that night, OGIA rang John Bevins's people at their hotel and told them that the field had been reduced to two&mdash;Bevins and Needhams&mdash;but that the decision was being `vociferously debated'. They were also told, `It wasn't looking good,' and that their poor prospects `didn't have much to do with the quality of their work'. So someone from OGIA has let the cat out of the bag. Someone has rung John Bevins and said, `Look, it is still being debated. We can't give you a result. However, you are not actually going to win'&mdash;that was the hint&mdash;or `you're not looking too good, but it is nothing to do with the quality of your bid'.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That one will be readily sourced to the managing director of John Bevins, Senator Macdonald. He happens to have the same name as you, but he is a little more trustworthy than you are. I also understand that Ms Farnsworth, from Mr Jull's office, was present for a while but then absented herself. I am not sure whether that was because she is a departmental liaison officer and the discussion became more political rather than administratively oriented.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not know&mdash;we will know one day because they are starting to blab already&mdash;which way people voted. My information is that Mr Petro Georgiou consistently voted against Needhams and that the majority in favour of Needhams was: Mr David Jull, minister; Mr Grahame Morris, chief political adviser to Mr Howard; and, in all probability, Ms Granger. I don't know where Senator Minchin voted on these matters. He decided to scratch himself from the speakers list today so we may not ever find out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why would there be a conflict of interest? We are entitled to ask: why would a firm rated fifth win? Why would a firm of the three properly market tested by Elliott and Shanahan not win? The answer comes just from going back through the newspapers and having a look at the role these principals of DDB Needham Adelaide have played in the last two years in politics in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 6 March 1996 Ms Pamela Williams, writing for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, noted that both Mr Mark Pearson and Ted Horton were brought in, on the recommendation of George Pattersons, by Andrew Robb to manage the Liberals' negative advertising campaign for the 1996 federal election. She observes that they were sought because `they knew just how to get down in the gutter'. This pair was `complemented by John King and Toby Ralph from DDB Needham Adelaide to advise on strategy'. She further noted that they, King and Ralph, had vast experience from state campaigns in Victoria, South Australia and the Northern Territory, where they had worked for the Liberal Party and the CLP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The links these individuals have with key Liberals is absolutely no coincidence. They <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> worked closely with Senator Minchin when he was director of the Liberal Party division in South Australia and when Mr Grahame Morris, chief political adviser to the Prime Minister, held the South Australian state directorship. This is a case of individuals not just working in one firm for a political party but being taken out of firms to work directly for the Liberal Party campaign. Upon their returning from that particular task to their firms, lo and behold they get the first major government advertising contract to come up in the life of this government. The Prime Minister's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Guide on key elements of ministerial responsibility</EMPHASIS> states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ministers should not exercise the influence obtained from their public office, or use official information to obtain any improper benefit for themselves or another.</PARA>
<PARA>I stress `or another'. Where are the conflicts of interest here? Does Mr Jull have a conflict of interest? Probably not. He has not had an interactive relationship with these key elements of DDB Needham Adelaide and the national creative director. Mr Georgiou had contact with them over time and was also, I think, responsible for getting them to become the master agency of the newly elected Kennett government in 1992 before they could give the contract to Leeds Media, even closer mates than Needhams. There is no doubt that Senator Minchin and Mr Morris, as employers of DDB Needham and supervisors of their efforts during the federal election, were intimately involved with these two particular people. Who knows what Ms Granger's contacts are? I do not know that she would have suffered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an interesting thing. Is it a proper procedure of this particular activity to delegate a voting right to a staff member? Is Ms Granger entitled to cast a vote on behalf of the Attorney-General, Mr Williams? Did she? Under what guidance? Mr Williams's answer in the House of Representatives today strongly implied that he left the decision in her hands and the vote in her hands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have long awaited the defence of Mr Jull, the Minister for Administrative Services, about this extraordinary contract. Rather than clearing the air with a full explanation or <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3960"> explaining the other criteria&mdash;which I will get to later&mdash;which was referred to by OGIA, all he has tried to do is blackmail the opposition. That was very similar to Senator Macdonald's approach today. The minister was quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS> on Wednesday, 2 October saying he had information on the Labor Party's awarding of contracts to `sink them forever'. He certainly did not give that information to Senator Macdonald for today. He was referring to Labor's previous decision at arms&hyphen;length to give John Singleton contracts. That is not the issue here. No-one is arguing that the government cannot award contracts to people who have had political dealings with them in the past. The question here is of merit and conflict of interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On any objective standard, Needhams were not the most meritorious, nor did they present the most appropriate strategy. Indeed, they were regarded as bordering on hopeless. Those who made the decision had clear conflicts of interest, which they failed to declare. That is the issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the minister has information about former Labor contracts, as he contends, bring it on. We have nothing to hide in that regard. The minister's comments have admitted his complicity in this absolutely sordid affair. He has nothing to say to try to put the record straight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was mentioned today, very disingenuously and pompously I thought, by Senator Macdonald that the dealings inside this committee are confidential. At the finance and public administration estimates hearing on Monday, 30 September, the question was not quite so clear. Senator Short said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would have thought that is a matter for the committee itself. I am not sure that that is proper to disclose, but let me take it on notice.</PARA>
<PARA>When asked if there was a confidentiality requirement on those attending the meeting, Senator Short replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is one of the points I have to find out.</PARA>
<PARA>When asked whether the confidentially would cover Mr Whelan and Mr Humphries, he stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would have thought that all persons attending such a meeting would observe the normal processes of confidentiality that relate to any meetings of this nature. But we have taken it on notice. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>Presumably this advice must have come up at lightning speed because Mr Humphries commented the following day, 1 October, on the ABC news program:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In my view and the view of most of the committee the DDB Needham campaign was superior and it got the job on the basis of the presentation.</PARA>
<PARA>But on ABC <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Drive Time</EMPHASIS>  that night, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think frankly at the end of the day there was no dissent from the view that Needham had the best presentation and put forward the best argument.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Howard, over in Perth at the same time, did not feel at all constrained to divulge what was happening in the committee. On 6PR that day he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Two of the three people he&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>meaning me&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">named as not being suitable to be on the committee, inside the committee's deliberations, voted in favour of another agency.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Macdonald came in here today and said the decision was absolutely unanimous for Needhams. We have Mr Humphries, the ACT police minister, saying it was unanimous. Yet the Prime Minister says two voted against it. I bet they did when they knew there were three votes in favour of it. I have no doubt two voted against it. If you are putting the fix in, make it three&hyphen;two and it will look a bit better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the crucial points here, though, is that the various losing firms are entitled to a debriefing. That sort of debriefing indicates to the losing companies where they went bad. When the principals at John Bevins Pty Ltd learnt that the DDB Needham proposal had barely met the requirements of the brief, had tested poorly and was full of contradictions, they immediately contacted OGIA for more information. They wrote to the Assistant General Manager seeking an assurance that their proposal was judged on its merits and an undertaking that they received a fair go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Upon hearing the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> program, which detailed further information about the fix on the advertising contract, John Bevins, through its manager, Ian Macdonald&mdash;not to be confused with the ambulance chaser over there&mdash;spoke with Ms Cathi Moore. He was informed that other criteria had entered into the appointment of the agency. What other <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3961"> criteria? There is still no explanation. They set up the terms on which to bid for this stuff. They set up the preconditions. Afterwards, having spent $80,000, this firm that should have won, but for the political fix, was told other criteria came into it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite reasonably, this particular company has asked what other criteria could possibly subsume the gulf that existed, according to both OGIA and Elliott &amp; Shanahan, that meant Needhams knocked off Bevins. There was no answer, of course, and no description. Let me tell you what the other criteria was. Let me tell you what Bevins' mistake was: it did not hire Ted Horton, the creative manager, to run its election campaign; it did not hire Toby Ralph from Needhams in Adelaide; it did not hire John King; and it did not have Senator Minchin and Mr Grahame Morris to supervise them all the way through the federal election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the biggest rort I have ever seen in my 15 years in politics, and I have seen a few&mdash;a company bagged so unmercifully by government public servants, by their hired qualitative research which assassinated their bid to win, when in fact they should never have been on the original list of five. It was only by Mr Grahame Morris putting the political fix in that they got on the list of five at all. He got them on the short list.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">OGIA recommended two for the short list, and it was Mr Grahame Morris who got them put on as the third company on the short list. It was he who argued and manipulated the whole committee to actually award this particular contract. You have to ask yourself what the Prime Minister is doing hiring someone who is just so crude at political manipulation as Mr Morris.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have here is the very first test of the Howard government in awarding of a tendering contract, not determined by public servants but by a ministerial committee. It went to a firm with a billing rate of only $5.6 million a year, not in the league of the others, whose two directors&mdash;owning 60 per cent of it&mdash;had worked actively in the federal election campaign. They use a creative director from the overall organisation to help with the pitch, who also worked on the Liberal campaign, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which was rated fifth by OGIA and third out of three by the qualitative research. It suddenly emerged through this particular process and won the contract.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What makes this even more galling is that they are dumping overboard all their original concepts of `bite the bullet'. They are actually now creating as we speak a new creative campaign that will not be market tested, that will not go back to the ministerial committee and that OGIA will not have to supervise. They will be able to bill full creative rates when everyone else had to subsume that in their $5,000 pitch fee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This particular contract should be ripped up. At the very least those poor suckers&mdash;those other companies who put in their bid in a genuine way&mdash;should be refunded their full tendering costs and not have to do with a $5,000 pitch fee. This is the biggest rort I have ever seen in politics.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You really know when Senator Robert Ray is struggling to make a contribution in this parliament. Senator Ray is normally one of the most articulate contributors to debate. When he has to come into this parliament with all these type-written notes so he knows what to say to fill up half an hour, you know that he is on shaky ground because he is unable to provide the evidence. He has had a little speech put in front of him and he has read it out to us today. It was quite clear that his heart was not in it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The mover of this motion is Senator Bolkus. It is just astounding that the Labor Party should be leading with Senator Bolkus, the one person in this place who has this unique capacity to dredge up sleaze and take up the time of this Senate on these little hunts which never produce anything. Every day I think that Senator Bolkus has hit a new depth, but no, the next day he somehow gets even lower. Against all our  expectations on this side Senator Bolkus always amazes us because he always descends that little bit deeper.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we think of Senator Bolkus's record we recall appointments to migration tribunals and things of that nature. I would have thought that Senator Bolkus would have been <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3962"> the very last person to try to make comments of this nature but, nevertheless, he did, living up to his reputation, which I suggest is most unfortunate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a real reason why Senator Bolkus and the opposition are running these campaigns against Senator Short and even now against a backbencher, Mr Georgiou, the member for Kooyong. They tried the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and they failed, they tried Senator Herron and they tried Senator Newman. They have tried everybody and they have failed, failed, failed so now they are right down to the backbenchers, hoping that they can lay a glove on the government because they have failed in all their other attempts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition is really trying to distract the attention of the Australian people from the very important task that we as a government have&mdash;that is, to fix up this economy from the mess that it was left in. We are trying to fix up the industrial relations system&mdash;the $10 billion black hole that the former Minister for Finance, the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), has left us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are talking about conflicts of interest, I wonder how many of the previous government's decisions were made by people such as Mr Brereton and Mr Keating, whose life in politics depended on the support of the trade union movement with endorsement and funding. But no, they brought in all the pro&hyphen;trade union legislation to assist the funding. Did they ever disqualify themselves or say, `Look, we've got a conflict of interest?' Of course they did not. Senator Bishop opposite notes that comment and is laughing. It is a point which I suggest has been well made by me and shows the absolute duplicity of the Australian Labor Party coming into this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are five paragraphs to Senator Bolkus's motion. The first one says that the Senate notes the awarding of an advertising contract to DDB Needham, Adelaide in spite of its being rated fifth. Nobody rated them fifth. Indeed, during Senate estimates the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> shows that Senator Ray himself was talking about moving the successful contractor from three to one. But of course now to embellish somewhat, he has extended it to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> make it from position five to one. On page 323 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of the Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee hearing this exchange occurs:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I am suggesting the fix was put in for a Liberal firm to win the contract, improving from third to first.</PARA>
<PARA>But Senator Rays comes in here saying it was from fifth to first. Then Senator Short says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think that that is a quite scurrilous allegation that has no substance&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Ray then said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We do not have any evidence as to what happened at that meeting&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>Yet, despite the fact that they do not have any evidence, they come in here trying to rewrite history making assertions that clearly are unsustainable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the world of advertising, are we on this side of the house honestly and genuinely to be guided by the Australian Labor Party as to how to effectively advertise? Are we really going to rely on the Labor Party to tell us that? How many governments do they have around this country? I think they have one by the skin of their teeth in New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 4 October 1996 <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ad News</EMPHASIS>, the trade news for the advertising industry, in a very perceptive editorial, made comments to which my colleague Senator Ian Macdonald has already referred. But there is one aspect which needs to be repeated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What needs to be remembered is that too much research can lead to bland ads. The issue . . . is should you believe research. There is a growing backlash against it. By all means do it. But be sensible in interpreting the results.</PARA>
<PARA>I just referred to whether or not we ought to rely on the Australian Labor Party for advice on whether or not we ought to embark upon a certain mode of campaigning and advertising.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Gary Gray, the National Secretary of the Australian Labor Party, provided a report concerning the 2 March 1996 election campaign. Page 7, under the heading `The Campaign', read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the political persona of the Parliamentary Leader, many Party members questioned the use of the "leadership" theme. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3963"> </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, this strategy was adopted through a broadly accepted process&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>So we have a situation where the Labor Party, in its own advertising for the last election, got qualitative research  back from their membership which told them, `Do not go down this line,' and they rejected that advice and deliberately went down that line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Out of their own mouths, they have shown us that the advertising news editorial of 4 October is absolutely spot&hyphen;on. Just because you have some research does not mean that you blindly follow it. You have to be sensible in interpreting the results and determining what can be the best outcome. Of course, the Australian Labor Party learnt, to their undoubted horror, that possibly the strategy which they adopted was not the best.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Party members, we are told in this document from Gary Gray, the federal secretary, pointed to specific campaigning failures. Can the Australian Labor Party honestly come into this place to tell us how we as a government ought be looking at advertising strategies and campaigns? They themselves rejected their own research on their campaign. So it is good enough for them but somehow not good enough for this government. Really, the first point of their motion has been absolutely knocked out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Paragraph (ii) notes that three gentlemen, principals of DDB Needham, were key advertising advisers to the Liberal Party during the 1996 federal election campaign. You have got that bit right. What a great success they were. A huge success! I suppose that Senator Ray and Senator Bolkus would really want us to give the failed Australian Labor Party campaigners a bit of money, comfort and succour in these times of need after their having run such a dud campaign for the ALP and the ALP now struggling to pay their commitments to those advertising agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Point (ii) of the motion simply makes an assertion with which we do not disagree, but there is nothing improper or anything inherently suggested in that second point with which we would take umbrage. Yes, the gentlemen concerned were key advisers, and they did a damn good job, as those on the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> other side, languishing in opposition, well know.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Point (iii) states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that the ministerial committee to determine these matters included . . . (Senator Minchin), Mr Grahame Morris and Mr Petro Georgiou, all of whom, in their previous capacities as State Directors of the Liberal Party in either South Australia or Victoria, had contracted with DDB Needham for that firm to perform work on behalf of the Liberal Party&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Absolutely incorrect. State directors do not sign up advertising agents for the Liberal Party. It is the executive that makes those sorts of decisions. You will not have any document, I would suggest to you, signed by these people suggesting that they had contracted that firm. So, on that basis, paragraph (iii) of the motion fails dismally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take the opportunity to speak of Senator Minchin, an excellent state director. The people of South Australia were so impressed by him that they said, `You are a bit of a waste being a state director. We want you in the Senate.' The Prime Minister did not take long at all to say, `You are a waste just as a senator, I want you as a parliamentary secretary.' So they got it right that Senator Minchin is a very good operator.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us move onto the issue of Mr Grahame Morris, an excellent adviser who has assisted the Prime Minister to become one of the most popular prime ministers, who won a successful campaign on 2 March. He is a great operator, who also operated very successfully in the South Australian division.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then, of course, there is Mr Petro Georgiou. The Labor Party really dislike this individual because he was the one who ran that successful campaign `The Guilty Party' against the Victorian Labor Party in the state <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3964"> election which saw the coming to power of Jeff Kennett, who most recently was re-elected with an overwhelming majority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know&mdash;and I see Senator Carr in the chamber&mdash;what the former parliamentary leader of the Labor Party in Victoria thought of Senator Kim Carr in relation to the sort of advice he was giving. Take the tip, Senator Carr&mdash;through you, of course, Madam Acting Deputy President: if we are to take some advice on how to advertise, we will listen to people like former Premier John Cain who, in a nutshell, basically said, `Any advice from Senator Carr is not worth having.' Given that your own side say that, Senator Carr, we will not take it either&mdash;believe it or not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I do this man a great injustice because the assertion is that somehow in all of this there is a conflict of interest. Allow me to quote the words of the illustrious Senator Carr:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Every day of the week all of us face potential for conflict of interest. The real issue in terms of public policy and public behaviour is whether action is actually taken which is in conflict of interest with our responsibility as public figures.</PARA>
<PARA>None of you were able to say that there was such an actual conflict of interest. Indeed, I think the furthest Senator Bolkus went was that there might be `a perception'. Even the strongest point that could be made by Senator Ray&mdash;who I thought usually was fairly fiery in these types of debates&mdash;was that there was `an interactive interest' between some people. That is not a conflict of interest. Just because you know some people and deal with them, having an interaction with them, all of a sudden it is a conflict of interest?</PARA>

Why don't we even go to that fellow who is suffering from&mdash;what is it&mdash;relevancy deprivation syndrome, or some thing, the honourable member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans)? He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the senator has any credible basis to suggest that the Prime Minister is involved in any conflict of interest, he's perfectly able to say so. But just sort of skirmishing around and raising issues of this kind in a half-baked fishing expedition&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>a very strange metaphor that, `a half-baked fishing expedition'. That is the old member for Holt, using some terminology that I am not sure necessarily is correct, but they are his words&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA>How you can have a half&hyphen;baked excursion, I do not know. But for the purposes of this debate, I will accept the remarks of the then Senator Gareth Evans, now the member for Holt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy President, until you can show that there was an actual conflict of interest, there is just no basis to your assertions. The strongest thing that could be said is that at one stage some of these people were state directors involved in the Liberal Party&mdash;and, might I add, as employees of the Liberal Party&mdash;and that, therefore, they should not in any way be dealing with that advertising agent, in Senator Minchin's case, three years on from his time as a state director; in Mr Georgiou's case, about two years; and in the case of Mr Morris it would be, I suggest, even more than three years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Really we have a situation where, sure, these people were contracted by the Liberal Party, but there was no basis at all for it to be suggested that the three individuals had actually contracted the advertising agency concerned. That is wrong, wrong, wrong in relation to the three gentlemen concerned. So paragraph 3 of the motion fails. Paragraph (iv) of the motion states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that none of the above declared that there was a conflict of interest in awarding the contract&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>There was no need to declare any such alleged conflict of interest, because there was none. If you want to make out the case that there was a conflict of interest, you really have to go a little further than did Senator Ray, in his quite pathetic presentation, sug <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3965"> gesting that there had been `an interactive interest' between them some time in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Was there any commercial benefit to any of the three gentlemen named in the motion? No. Did any of the three gentlemen concerned have shares in the company or were they employed by the company in the past, anything of that nature? To any question of that nature that you want to serve up, the answer is no on each and every occasion. If you cannot make out the case that there was some real connection between them, you have to say that there was no possibility for the conflict of interest that has been asserted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last one is the prospect, I suppose, for employment for some unemployed Labor lawyer. It calls on the government to set up an independent judicial inquiry into the tendering process and related matters. We have a situation where the fifth paragraph relies on all the assertions in the previous four paragraphs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only paragraph that stands is paragraph (ii), which notes that the people who happened to have got this contract also assisted the Liberal Party in the last election. That is the only basis that is now left before the Senate to justify this call for a judicial inquiry. Senator Ray himself said on 30 September 1996 that the fact that an advertising agency which had worked for a political party should not disqualify it from getting a government contract. In Senator Ray's own words, that argument fails as well. Therefore we are left with a position where there is no basis left whatsoever for the assertion and request made in paragraph (v) of the motion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Some comments were made during the debate that really do need to be answered. It is wrong to assert that only two advertising agencies were put on the short list by the preliminary panel and that Mr Morris or whoever had the other one added later. In fact, three companies were on the short list right from the beginning and it included the one that we are talking about today, DDB Needham. They were all selected by the preliminary panel. The preliminary selection panel, which drew up this short list, was made up overwhelmingly of departmental officials. There were several OGIA people and bureau crats from the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department and departmental agencies. The only representatives of the government on that panel was the person from the Attorney&hyphen;General's office and one person from the Prime Minister's office&mdash;hardly able to roll the situation and manipulate it, as has been asserted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition alleges that OGIA's involvement or assessment was strongly against DDB and strongly for Bevins. If that is the case, why did the preliminary selection panel agree to the short listing of DDB? Why did they agree to that if what you people on the other side are asserting is correct? You have made these bland assertions. I am telling you what the facts are and you are unable to respond. The answer is that OGIA were in support of DDB being on the short list. I really ought to say to the opposition: if you want to come up with hard&hyphen;hitting motions in this place, do not rely on Senator Bolkus because his performances of late have been so pathetic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One thing that really highlighted how pathetic the antics of Senator Bolkus were was shown to us yesterday when we heard one of the finest first speeches in this place for a long time from Senator Jeannie Ferris. Senator Bolkus has been on a campaign to destroy that lady from day one and he has failed, failed, failed. Now he has come up with another motion; he will fail again. The bad grace of Senator Bolkus was shown. Everybody else from the opposition came across to congratulate Senator Ferris; there was Senator Bolkus sitting by himself in his seat. In fact, I beckoned him to come across, show some good grace and congratulate Senator Ferris. But the mean spirited nature of the individual was such that he could not move himself across the chamber to congratulate Senator Ferris on an excellent first speech. The senator's mean spirited nature is once again revealed today in this motion, which peddles sleaze and peddles innuendo that has no basis in fact. So if we look at this motion&mdash;</PARA>

That was a very useful exercise we went through as we participated in the discussion of that committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the very early observations I made as I watched the committee go about its activity was that Senator Ian Macdonald took a very relaxed, almost disinterested, attitude to the deliberations of the committee and the questions that were asked at that committee. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> He was relaxed, leaning back and not greatly interested in the process at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had presumed that the purpose of that committee was to do some program analysis, some financial analysis, some questioning of the departmental officials and to gain some useful information for our deliberations later. I was very surprised as Senator Ray engaged in a process of examination of the minister and a number of departmental officials who were involved in this process of awarding the tender.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I was most interested in as the discussion pursued was how Senator Macdonald became agitated and for the first time in three days became very interested in the deliberations of the committee and attempted to raise a number of red herrings, as he has pursued in this debate today in reference to Senator Richardson, Mr Singleton and past contracts awarded by the previous government. But his manner, his demeanour, changed as Senator Ray pursued his particular avenue and, indeed, gained a lot of interesting information about the process of awarding the tender in this particular issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the information that has been put before us today. Let us review the tender process, the decision making of the relevant parties and the consequences that need to be visited upon a number of those persons. Firstly, let us turn to the motion itself.

<PARA>The motion raises serious issues of principle and it needs proper and reasoned consideration. So let us go through that process: first, the review of the tender process; secondly, the decision making of the relevant parties; and, thirdly, the consequences for the relevant participants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As has been outlined and not seriously disputed by the government, it is relatively clear what occurred. The government, in its wisdom, made a decision to conduct an advertising campaign arising out of the terrible events at Port Arthur. There was nothing wrong with that. It sought voluntary compliance with its future gun legislation and allocated something in the order of $2 million for all communication activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The brief that was sent out to the advertising agencies sought voluntary compliance. It sought that the public be informed which guns, rifles, et cetera, were barred and which of those guns or rifles had restricted activities. It sought to influence the community so that the community surrendered its firearms. The brief, as I understand it, as customary practice, invited 200 advertising firms to tender. Those firms' names were maintained on a public register. The first point, as we understand it, was that DDB was not on that register; it was added later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 5 August, after reviewing submissions, five firms were asked to submit. All of those bids were submitted for market testing in a range of areas and occupations of both genders in metropolitan and rural areas across the nation. It was a very wide testing exercise that the government sought on the five bids.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The pitch that was put by DDB Needham we were told by OGIA was `Gun control: It's Time to Bite the Bullet'. This particular pitch was not received well. The test groups comprising the focus groups found it negative, discouraging and offensive. OGIA's evaluation was that the DDB brief barely matched the terms of reference. They did not meet the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> demands of the brief. They were difficult to assess. It generated considerable anger. It was seen as dictatorial, and the research showed that gun owners rejected the idea of the campaign. On the advice of the evaluation department, the DDB brief was poorly put together, contrary to the purpose of the government and tested badly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">OGIA, the Office of Government Information and Advertising, also tested the other briefs. What emerged is also clear and on the public record from the estimates committee. The information in a range of the other briefs was very clear. There was widespread approval by the focus groups. The Bevins brief was determined to be superior. It had strong branding and a positive response. It did not confuse and it generated interest and impact. The participants said the Bevins brief was down to earth and its pitch clear. So the focus groups, as reported by OGIA in their evaluation to the estimates committee, gave virtually zero out of 100 to the DDB brief and very high marks to the other briefs, in particular the Bevins brief.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In late August a ministerial committee was established. We were told, as I recall, at the estimates committee that two tenders were short&hyphen;listed. Senator Abetz made some comments on that, and I will return to that later. A week later, on 2 September, the short list was increased to three. The third firm, being the eventual successor, was the firm which had been rated most poorly by the evaluation agency. We were told today that Mr Morris, chief political adviser to the Prime Minister, insisted upon the DDB brief being included and the number being increased to three.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us now turn to the decision making process and the participants in that process&mdash;the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Jull); Senator Minchin; Mr Georgiou; Mr Grahame Morris, the chief political adviser to the Prime Minister, Mr Howard; and an adviser to the Attorney-General, Mr Williams. We were told there were also other state ministers and their advisers present&mdash;Mr Whelan from New South Wales and Mr Humphries and their advisers in an advisory capacity but not in a voting capacity. A <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3968"> number of staff from OGIA and other agencies were also present.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The meeting, we were told, kicked off around about 5.30 p.m. It adjourned for dinner and a decision was anticipated to be made after dinner. Around about 9.30 p.m. there was a break and Bevins was informed that the final decision was being vociferously debated. Bevins's poor prospects were nothing to do with the quality of its work and it was indicated that its brief would be unsuccessful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we come to the interesting part of the evening, as outlined by Senator Bolkus and Senator Robert Ray. Around about 10.30 p.m. it was thought that the deliberations should be concluded. Public servants were asked to leave. The note taking process ceased, no minutes were kept, no records were taken and no independent witnesses were available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Around about 11 p.m. before the vote, Mr Whelan from New South Wales left the meeting to return to his home. What we know occurred after that was that DDB was given the contract. It had the poorest rating from OGIA. It had the last ranking of fifth out of five. It was short&hyphen;listed at the request of Mr Morris, but it was given the job and the revenues at around about 12.10 p.m.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The aftermath, according to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper, is relatively clear. Three of the five persons who participated&mdash;and I will not repeat the details, because they were outlined by Senator Robert Ray&mdash;apparently voted for another firm, not for DDB. But, as we now know and as was explained at the estimates committee, the DDB firm gained the contract.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That firm has been engaged in extensive work for the Liberal Party over a number of years in South Australia, Victoria and at a national level. Indeed, I must concur with what Senator Robert Ray said. I do not have any particular problem with advertising agencies, professional firms, legal accounting or whatever gaining work from governments or political parties. The only caveat I would offer is that the process needs to be clear, it needs to be transparent, it needs to be noted and it needs to be capable of independent verification. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the complaint is not that the contract was awarded to the DDB firm; the complaint and the nature of this debate is about the process of awarding that contract. It seems to me, looking on from the outside, that there was a degree of chicanery and a degree of improper involvement, and a decision that is improper. I do not share Senator Robert Ray's view that it is the greatest political rort of the last 15 years or the greatest political rort of all time. It strikes me as being mean, pithy and a very poor effort. I suggest that those who were involved in the decision making process should have disqualified themselves; they should not have participated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next thing we are aware of is that the size of the contract increased from the original amount of $1 million or $2 million to over $3 million by a decision of cabinet on or around 24 September. What are the consequences of this decision making process and the awarding of the contract? We know that the advertising campaign has been delayed. It is non-existent in a number of states. Even though the campaign is non-existent in those states&mdash;it has not been run, it is not currently being run and, apparently, there is no intention to run it in the immediate future&mdash;the guns are still being surrendered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why has this occurred? As it was explained today&mdash;and not rebutted by Senator Macdonald or Senator Abetz&mdash;DDB was not ready. It was not able to give effect to the large contract that had been awarded to its firm. So the original campaign by DDB was poorly put together; there was little to no merit, as said in the evaluation process; the brief was not completed; and the job has not been delivered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We send a terrible message to professional organisations, to professional associations and to the advertising industry: we send a message that process is not important. We send a message that corruption in the process is something that is going to be tolerated. It is not the way that we should be engaged in business. It is not the way this government, or any government, should be engaged in the letting of significant contracts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3969"> I would like to turn to the contributions of Senator Macdonald and Senator Abetz. Sena tor Macdonald did not rebut any of the points raised by the prior debaters. He tried to colour the issues, to confuse us by making references to Senator Richardson, to Mr Singleton and to Mr Cameron. He expressly denied any illegal or improper activity on the part of any of those men or their organisations. He expressly denied that. He kept dancing around the sides, hinting at improper behaviour. He then covered himself by saying, `Nothing occurred. I raise nothing. I make no allegations.' He simply sought to confuse the issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it raises what criteria were used to award the contract? What were the criteria that defeated the Bevins firm? We do not know. All we know is that a decision was made. What was the mistake of Mr Bevins? He was not involved with the Liberal Party. That was his mistake. He had no influence in the decision making process. His submission had a lot of merit. It was the best submission. His fault, his mistake, was that he had no influence. He had no contacts. He had a lot of merit, a lot of hard work and a lot of skill, but no influence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we should now turn in that context to the contribution of Senator Abetz. Senator Abetz made nine points in his submission. Firstly, he made some references to trade unions and members of parliament who were formerly union officials, and he suggested they should disqualify themselves from participation in this debate. How that related to the motion, he did not explain. It was a gratuitous aside.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">His second point&mdash;and it seems to be a feature in his debating style&mdash;was that he referred to the report by Gary Gray after the last federal election. That report, of course, was a report to members of the Australian Labor Party as to why we lost the election. It bore no relationship to the motion before us, to the awarding of the contract, but it is worth while to throw into the debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">His third point was that he chose to misunderstand or misinterpret the significance of paragraph (ii) in the motion. His fourth point was an arcane legal point as to the legal status of the Liberal Party and its agents at law in terms of the signing of documents. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Once again, one asks how that relates to the motion before us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">His fifth point was Mr Grahame Morris's role and his apparent responsibility for the temporary high standing of the Prime Minister in the polls. His sixth point was some off-the-cuff reference by former Senator Gareth Evans, and he thought it was so worth while that he repeated it five times.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">His seventh point was commercial benefit to persons individually in paragraph (iv). He made reference to the selection panel. My memory of the evidence at the estimates committee was that two firms were short-listed, that it was the advice of the officer from OGIA that it was not three&mdash;that the third firm, the firm that eventually gained the contract, was added at a later time. Finally, Senator Abetz gave us his assessment of Senator Bolkus's character. How any of that related to the issue under discussion escapes me. None of it addressed the merit of the motion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, in summing up, it appears that there has been a degree of impropriety in the process of awarding this contract. It involves senior members of the government and officials of the staff of the Prime Minister. There is conflicting advice given to the Senate via the estimates committee and in the contributions today as to what actually occurred. There is certainly enough evidence put before the Senate today to suggest that an inquiry is needed to establish what the facts were, what the facts are&mdash;indeed to review this entire process. So I would urge the passage of this motion before us today.</PARA></SPEECH>

But what they may not have known&mdash;or maybe they knew and withheld it from this Senate; that, in itself, would be a shameful act&mdash;is that it is our understanding that one of the principal authors of the report prepared by the Office of Government Information and Advertising has, in fact, been offered a lucrative position with Bevins advertising agency: the very advertising agency which that mob on the other side claims should have this contract. That is the apparent conflict of interest. It is not a conflict of interest that affects Senator Minchin, it is not a conflict of interest that affects Mr Georgiou, nor is it a conflict of interest that affects Mr Morris. What we have is an apparent conflict of interest within the government office that prepared the assessment on which the people opposite have relied for over two hours this afternoon as the only substance for their debate.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the course of the debate earlier on this afternoon Senator Bolkus told us that an officer from the department absented himself from a meeting at 9.30 in the evening and phoned Bevins to say, `You've got a great presentation. I don't think you're going to get it and it has not got anything to do with the quality of the presentation.' Was that officer the same officer who helped prepare this report? Was it the same officer who, we understand, has been offered a very lucrative contract with Bevins? I suspect that the silence from the other side of the chamber now is proof positive that the opposition have been caught out. They came in here wanting a debate on sleaze and wanting to smear people's integrity, and yet the truth is that they did not have the integrity to tell the Senate chamber all that they knew or should have known about this sordid matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the case now that the minister has asked the secretary to make a report on the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> whole proceedings of this matter, because it is highly worrying that a government officer would be the principal author of a report recommending an advertising agency which has offered him a very lucrative contract. It would be even more disturbing if an opposition, knowing all these facts, used that report&mdash;selectively used that report, as they have this evening&mdash;to attempt to smear the good name, the character and the integrity of an honourable senator in this chamber and an honourable member of the other place. That is what the Labor Party have done. They have no intention at all in this debate of having integrity, having a full disclosure, having the truth or having the facts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The great thing about hypocrisy as far as the opposition are concerned is that you do not have to worry about the facts getting in the way of your prejudices. That is the fact. They do not have to worry about the facts because, if you believe in hypocrisy, you never let facts get in the way of your prejudice. All we have seen tonight has been two hours of prejudice dredged up by the other side and yet the facts are quite contrary to that prejudice. The facts reveal a situation other than that alleged by those who sit on the other side of the chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that those on the other side who spoke earlier and who have accused Senator Minchin and Mr Georgiou of impropriety ought to come into this chamber on the adjournment tonight and apologise. Senator Bolkus ought to come in here and apologise, Senator Ray ought to come in here and apologise, and Senator Bishop should not take a step out of this place. If they do not apologise then they are not men of integrity and they are not men who seek the truth; they are men who will use any device and any opportunity to twist the facts&mdash;not to achieve the truth, but for their own grubby political ends. Those who live by the sword die by the sword. And they are dying a gruesome death on the other side of the chamber. What we have here now are the facts. Those facts are very clear and the opposition can have no answer to those facts. That is why they ought to have the decency to apologise and to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3971"> withdraw the motion currently before the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We could go on at great length about all the impropriety that occurred when the previous government was in power. When former Senator Richardson was the minister responsible for choosing advertising, the only protection we had against impropriety was that he had two other members on the committee who were not as friendly with Mr Singleton as he was! They were not bosom buddies, but that does not say that they were going to ensure propriety; they just were not as friendly as he was. That was the only standard of propriety that existed when the Labor Party were in government, and now they come in here and want another standard of propriety. And yet, when the truth is brought out and when we say, `Yes, there may have been a conflict of interest, but it wasn't Senator Minchin's conflict of interest and it wasn't Mr Georgiou's conflict of interest,' they squeal like stuck pigs&mdash;and so they ought, because a little bit of the truth can be a painful thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that honourable senators on the other side often can only take a little bit of the truth in each day. It is only in small doses that truth can be allowed to reign on the other side. When they are confronted with the full force of the truth, when they are confronted with the truth in all its glory, what do they do? They squeal and complain and say, `Step out of the chamber.' We have had two hours of the people on the other side in this place alleging the most appallingly defamatory things against an honourable member of this chamber and an honourable member of the other place&mdash;and not once did they bother to step outside and say it. And yet, when the truth comes out, they say, `Step outside, step outside, step outside.' When Senator Cook, Senator Ray and Senator Bolkus want to step outside and put their absurd, irrational and thoroughly reprehensible comments to the test in a court of law, we will find them wanting of will.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have been great heroes for two hours and now they are turning into cowards without conviction because the truth is that every one of the allegations that these people have raised has been utterly spurious. Their only <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> source of information for the speeches we have had from the other side, from what we can gather, was the report prepared by somebody whom we believe to have had a vested financial interest in one advertising company coming out the winner in that process. That advertising company did not come out, so I wonder how it is that the Labor Party became aware of this whole process. Maybe this matter does deserve further investigation but not further investigation in this chamber&mdash;further investigation on the proper procedures to ascertain how it was that this shameful debate could have been given any semblance of credibility by the people on the other side and how somebody could have fed them the information which they have used to smear the integrity of two fine people on this side of the chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition ought to hang their heads in shame. They ought to come in here and apologise. They ought to withdraw this ridiculous and shameful motion because, if they do not do those things, then it is clear that the opposition loves to use hypocrisy and loves to use prejudice, but is afraid of the facts and is afraid of what will happen when their spurious allegations are exposed for all to see. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not have the report in front of me. I have sent for a copy of it&mdash;it has not yet arrived in the chamber&mdash;and I want to make a couple of comments about it. As the program shows and as you have rightly described it, this is a government response to the report of the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities dealing with the annual <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3972"> reports of the Australian Securities Commission and other bodies. The Securities Commission has attracted&mdash;and does from time to time&mdash;critical analysis and appraisal in the popular media as to its effectiveness. Obviously, it does that because, as the watchdog on corporate governance in Australia, it has reposed in it the key responsibility on behalf of taxpayers to ensure that the affairs of the corporate world are run with probity and in compliance with the law. The obligation on the Securities Commission is to detect fraud when and if it occurs and to refer matters to prosecution should there be a case for that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of white collar crime and corporation corruption, it is a major responsibility and, within its resources, I think the Securities Commission handles its responsibilities with great effectiveness. Nonetheless, what also has to be said is that there are, increasingly, comments about the number of corporate criminals that have been brought to justice in this country and questioning of how effective the ASC is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a matter of public record that only two people have been convicted of insider trading in Australia in the most recent past and that does not seem to accord with marketplace experience of how extensive this practice might be. Indeed, as a consequence of the foreign takeover of TNT, the Australian owned transport company, last week there were quite strong allegations that some inside knowledge of the impending takeover may have governed particular investments in share purchases that resulted in massive windfall gains to those individuals who exercised those share purchases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If one reads the published information&mdash;and I only have access to what is in the media on this&mdash;certainly, prima facie, there is a case to say that massive gains were made and that the circumstances in which they were achieved raise reasonable doubt as to whether or not they were done honestly. I am sure that matter is being investigated by the ASC. I mention that only to illustrate the point that there is, behind the comments about corporate criminality, some empirical evidence in the marketplace to suggest or to justify continuing concern about the effectiveness of the ASC.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We recently went through the estimates processes with the ASC and discussed with them at considerable length, as the estimates processes enable us to do, measures that they are taking in order to improve their circumstances. Indeed, my colleague the shadow minister for communications, Chris Schacht, extensively quizzed the ASC and cited the landmark publication <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Bold Riders</EMPHASIS>, which is a close history of corporate corruption in Australia with reference particularly to the period in the 1980s when many of the corporate cowboys got away with millions of dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He took the ASC quite carefully through some of the allegations made, to test how their detection and scrutiny processes had benefited from those learning experiences and whether or not those experiences were capable of being created again in Australia. I must say that, while the answers of the ASC were professional and persuasive, nonetheless there still is a nagging doubt as to whether the ASC is as fully equipped as it ought to be to discharge its obligations to the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In saying that, and in referring to that nagging doubt, I want to say very clearly and very publicly that that is not to question the professionalism of the officers of this body. Indeed, one would see that those officers, in being questioned in an estimates committee process, in any case have an obligation to defend the integrity of the commission. It is certainly not the purpose of the questioners, in this case, to in any way reflect upon the commission, for fear that that may encourage or embolden actual or potential corporate criminals into believing that they can get away with their nefarious acts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Faced with those considerations, I have to say that the decision in this current budget to reduce the funding to this body does raise some doubts in my mind as to whether or not the ASC is adequately funded by the government to do the task it has and to shoulder the heavy responsibility that it has before it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the key issues here is that the level of corporate corruption tends to follow in a staged way. We had an outbreak of it in the 1980s. We had evidence in the committee inquiry of the degree and magnitude of it. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3973"> Quite astonishing fortunes were made. Charges have been preferred against individuals but, because individuals themselves have benefited massively financially from that corruption, they are cashed up and able to engage highly qualified legal counsel who bog down court proceedings for prosecution with endless technicality and delay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The very wealth they generate by their corruption, if you like, acts as a way of hiring legal armour to prevent them from being, at the end of the day, prosecuted. Certainly, if they are not prosecuted successfully it means that the law has been complied with. But the issue here is whether, in complying with the law, justice has been delivered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I rise to speak on this paper in order to make the point that I think the government owes the taxpayers of this country&mdash;the many thousands of honest business people, men and women, who go about their affairs in the expectation that other business colleagues observe business law properly&mdash;an assurance that their interests are properly protected and that the ASC is funded to do its job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We heard evidence also that the likelihood of one of Australia's most notorious corporate criminals, Christopher Skase, ever being able to be brought to justice in Australia now is so remote as not to be considered a possibility at all. And that is a further illustration of the problem here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In nub, my point is that, with the current concern being expressed about the degree of corporate criminality, the watchdog that has the responsibility to detect it and refer matters for prosecution over it, and the cost of bringing to justice cashed&hyphen;up corporate crooks who are able to hire expensive legal counsel to protect them, are the important issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not saying in any way that the government is necessarily reducing funds to the ASC in order to make it easier for corporate corruption. Nonetheless, it is very important that the role of the ASC be properly resourced in order to ensure that that corruption does not occur.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you indeed. And this inquiry was into a major entity in the portfolio of science. As a consequence, since it raised issues of whether or not the CSIRO was properly balanced and targeted, to discharge my responsibility as a science minister I followed the affairs of this inquiry quite closely, and, I might say, received criticism as a minister from the then opposition&mdash;now the government&mdash;for failing, as I think they would term it, to impose upon the CSIRO their version of what the CSIRO should do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my view, the reason this report was originally developed in the Senate is that the CSIRO were rationalising the establishment of their rural research agencies. They were doing this in a number of states, one of which was Western Australia and that excited the interests of some Western Australian senators in the then opposition at the time. Therefore, I took the view that this inquiry arose from special pleading by a sectional interest rather than because of a general concern about the nature and suitability of the administration and vital nature of the CSIRO at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that the report was more sweeping than that and the report came to a number of conclusions with which I am in hearty concord. It did serve, I think, a useful role at the end of the day. However and nonetheless, the argument remained that I, the minister, should somehow interfere with the CSIRO. I want to deal with that because it <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3974"> touches directly on the matter that is before the chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The CSIRO is a statutory organisation. It is in many respects Australia's premiere science body. It is one of the oldest. It is certainly the grandest of all the science institutions we have in this country. It rightfully and properly enjoys a large reputation for excellence in Australia and has a peerless international reputation as well. I think there is a degree of common view about that. Because it is so large, it has reached so wide and the issues with which it deals are so important, there is also a constant audience of criticism as to whether the CSIRO as a major organisation has all of its settings absolutely right. The first thing the CSIRO would say is that it is absolutely sure it hasn't, but it tries to get them right and works as closely with advisory panels and with community needs and sectional interests as it can in order to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is also fundamental to this is that the board that governs the CSIRO, which has under its act the statutory responsibility for administering the organisation, is not something which ministers should tinker with. The board has an obligation under its act. The board is appointed. The board has to clear with the minister its corporate plan and its strategic plan for addressing the issues that it has responsibility for, and it does that. But it is for the organisation to deliver and not for ministers to politically interfere and push the CSIRO down the course of picking winners or direct how the CSIRO should deploy its funding in order to meet the needs of sectional interests. That has to be quite categoric. That has to be quite clear between all of us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is for those reasons that I, as minister at the time, resisted pressures placed on me, some of which emanated in this chamber, to interfere with the CSIRO and direct its research effort in a way in which particular honourable senators would want me to do. Having said that, the other factor here too was that the CSIRO itself was undertaking a major review of its operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said earlier, the CSIRO is sensitive to public criticism and is aware of the weighty responsibility it has under its act. It is an organisation that is conscientious about <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> pursuing its goals. The board had introduced a major review of its management structure and even if I were tempted to intervene, as the pressure was pushing me to do, it was prudent not to for the very reason that the board was itself addressing issues that it felt important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That has been quite a major review by the CSIRO. The former director of the CSIRO has to take a lot of credit for the way in which that review was conducted and for the extensive public consultations and intra&hyphen;organisational consultations he undertook so that the outcome of the review was effective from the point of view that it did the job that was required and it did not forsake honest scrutiny for internal peace. It addressed the real questions head on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, the outcome, once formed in the mind of the reviewing body, was consulted through the organisation in a way in which the members of that organisation felt part of it, owned it and were able to apply themselves to the new direction the organisation had adopted. The government response to this Senate committee report shows, in relation to many of the recommendations, that it acknowledges that the CSIRO restructuring has been quite considerable and very effective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second ground is that the CSIRO was doing the job, has now done the job and the government of which&mdash;that is, the senators who were then in opposition and were criticising me&mdash;does endorse the restructuring self-imposed by the board on the CSIRO with the consensus and support of workers and stakeholders in that organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What also has to be said about this is that there is a tendency to think of a body like the CSIRO in a static way. When the CSIRO was first created, the major industries in this country were pastoral, agricultural and mining and the CSIRO in its early days achieved part of its international reputation by breakthrough research in those particular areas, meeting the needs of those industry sectors. The science that it did in the manufacturing sector added to its reputation, but its main preoccupation was in the other areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Science is not a static thing. The frontiers of science are exploding exponentially all the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3975"> time. It is refining itself and becoming more detailed. Areas of science which are now a gleam in the eye of some scientists, or do not even exist in fact, will in five or 10 years time be areas of public demand and of great importance, such is the exploding nature of knowledge in the science area, and the CSIRO as a body has to keep abreast of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, under its mandate, this is an organisation under considerable strain at all times to meet its obligations to the community. It has to be said that it is an organisation which would have it no other way. The rise of information technology, the rise of genetic research and the rise of a whole range of new areas of science and research in light metals and across areas of environmental technology are specialities that now are obvious to us which were not on the map 10 years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is not surprising, given those strains and those pressures, the CSIRO is in a constant state of reorganising its priorities and focusing the effort where it will do most good in the national interest. In constantly restructuring itself to deliver that outcome, it is not surprising from time to time that when sectional interests divine particular needs may not be serviced as they choose to require them to be there will be outcries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask that the Senate remind itself always that this is an organisation with an incredible mandate which is expanding all the time. It does behove governments to give it the support necessary to address those issues, and that includes rural research. It does behove the government to do that, but it also behoves governments to support it in being at the leading edge in the frontiers of the new areas of research that are developing. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too want to join with Senator Cook in drawing attention to the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">CSIRO: The case for revitalisation</EMPHASIS> . We had in Senator Cook a very good minister. Since the change of government we have seen a reduction in the funding to the CSIRO. Out of this report I wanted to look specifically at rural research, particularly at Chiswick, Arding and Longford. These are properties up near Armidale.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the report it was recommended that these not be sold. However, the government and the CSIRO have decided to do differently. There were 80 staff employed in that area. It is now down to 35. We actually had the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr McGauran) up there last week saying this was wonderful, they were saving it, but a number of those projects do not have a particularly long lifespan. I am not sure what happens to Armidale's Chiswick after that is completed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a rural community in the middle of the wool growing area and in the middle of the beef industry. It is close to grain production and a wide range of other agricultural pursuits. Yet we have the government saying that reducing the scientific staff from 80 to 35 is a plus for CSIRO. It is certainly not a plus for Armidale. It is certainly not a plus for those who have been involved with CRCs and every other sort of research that goes on in the area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a synergy between CSIRO, the CRCs and the University of New England. I would have thought the government would have been looking at ways to maximise that synergy to provide for the employment of people in rural areas because CSIRO has such a significant contribution to make in the area of rural production and rural research, but that does not appear to be the case. It is becoming easier and easier these days to actually site institutions in rural areas because with the advent of improved technology, improved telecommunications and the like, communication is not a problem and the transfer of information and material between the various institutions of the organisation also is not a problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to this reduction and sale, I am concerned that a lot of the money that has gone into the development of these sites has actually come from the wool growers through Wool International. I wonder legally just how many of those sites are owned fully by CSIRO and how many might well be said to be owned by the wool industry. They are very concerned about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The newspapers of the area in the last number of weeks have certainly been raising the concerns, the concerns of the mayor of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3976"> Armidale and the mayor of Dumeresq. They have every right to be concerned because they are seeing the bleeding by this government of the intellectual base from their area. There is nowhere else in the region that scientists can hope to get a job, that the 40-odd who have been given redundancies can hope to get similar employment. The university may be able to take one or two. The state government's vet labs may be able to take one or two, but that leaves the rest. What are they going to do? We are going to see a continuation of the brain drain from rural Australia, in this case rural New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What it costs people to sell their houses in Armidale is nowhere near the replacement cost of housing the people will have to buy. If they move to get a job in science, they are likely to move to a capital city. So they are going to be discriminated against and have hardship placed upon them in the purely physical sense of having to sell their house for a value that is less than an equivalent house in a capital city or a much larger centre that they will be forced to move to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have to ask: what is going to happen to the schools and to the communities? When you lose 45 people, if they move from the area, you lose 45 families. There is the multiplier effect in employment, spending and the schools and institutions in the community. Presumably a number of the spouses also have employment in the area, so what is going to be the impact?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, we are seeing this government cause a brain drain from the rural areas of Australia, especially New South Wales in this case, to the cities. This is the government that is supposed to be concerned about rural areas. From talking to the people in the region&mdash;many of them are National Party voters and card&hyphen;carrying members of the National Party&mdash;I have found that they are very angry about this because they feel that they have been let down by their party and by their government. That is something that people need to be very conscious of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I repeat: these are areas that have been doing research that is of high value to the farming communities and the grazing communities. The amount of money that they are <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> receiving from the private sector, from external sources, is very high. It is above the amount set by the board of CSIRO. They have done everything they can to provide a high level scientific research service. It is a research service that has operated in very close cooperation with the industry. A number of extremely good projects are being run. It would be very sad to see these not continue or not receive extensions to their time when the current funding levels are completed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It behoves the government to look very carefully at this issue, but they are not going to. Whilst they stood up on budget night and said that they had increased funding to the CSIRO, when you actually took into account the efficiency dividends across the board and several other cuts, they are receiving less money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is determined to reduce the scientific work that is carried out in this country. It is not only going to lead to a brain drain out of the rural areas but it is also going to lead to a brain drain as scientists will have to leave Australia to find gainful work and continue to undertake their extremely important research work. I urge the government to think very carefully about this. This appears to be just another example of the attitude that farmers are beginning to think this government has of not caring about the future of agriculture in this country. They think they are more interested in other pursuits and other forms of income revenue and sources of revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I leave it there by repeating that this is of major concern to the people in the Armidale and New England regions of New South Wales, as I am sure it is to the farming communities and the woolgrowers and the beef producers right across this country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This report of the Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts References Committee entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telstra: To sell or not to sell? </EMPHASIS> contains a huge number of issues that go not only to the issue of the partial privatisation of Telstra but really explore where our telecommunications industry is going in Australia. As a member of the committee that conducted the inquiry during the winter recess it was interesting to see the behaviour of the government members on that committee and the way in which they complained bitterly about having to go through the exercise of conducting the inquiry. Whilst I do not want to dwell on that point, I would like to make the comment that that leads to a very clear situation of the government having something to hide on this issue. The basis of it is as follows.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The association between the partial sale of Telstra and the environment was motivated out of a cute political trick. It was a cute political trick engineered by the government with no policy substance but done in a way to try to link the numbers in this place to pursuing a piece of legislation that solved some of their financial problems in their overcommitments in the election campaign to funding $7 billion of an alleged deficit and so forth. The fact that that has not worked has been exposed thoroughly through the subsequent experience we have had with the exploration of the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill. The relevant legislation committee heard that the environment groups in Australia are not convinced that it is a necessity to partially sell Telstra to fund the environment program.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those environment groups have said that the linking of the sale of Telstra in funding those crucial environment programs sets a very dangerous precedent. It sets a precedent on the basis that this government proposes to sell public assets to fund recurrent expenditure programs. The programs listed in the natural heritage trust bill are recurrent expenditure programs. This flies in the face of the comments made in the coalition's policy document that the revenue created from the sale of public assets, specifically Telstra in this case, will go towards capital expenditure only and capital programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This serves as evidence of the motivation of the coalition to linking the sale of Telstra with the environment program. It is a political con. They know it has not worked. The coalition has prepared its minority report and are saying, `We have the evidence to show that there is some merit in the partial privatisation of Telstra.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is where this report is so crucial and important to this debate. It exposes the very point that this government cannot produce evidence. They cannot produce evidence that the partial privatisation of Telstra will benefit the community in this country and the competitive position of Telstra and its development. They cannot produce any evidence that there will be any benefit with respect to the issues that were raised about the future of our telecommunications industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the course of the inquiry, the only groups to really come out in support of the coalition's policy were&mdash;lo and behold!&mdash;Telstra themselves, the Department of Finance and, of course, the Department of Communications and the Arts. There were certainly other groups that supported the notion of partial privatisation, but their evidence was based on the same flawed evidence put forward by the departments in the period this inquiry was conducted. That evidence was based primarily on a World Bank study, which looked at overseas privatisations and tried to extract specific areas where productivity improved as a result of privatisation as distinct from competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is where they failed to draw any comparison. They could not prove in any <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3978"> way, shape or form that there was a benefit in introducing partial privatisation as opposed to increasing competition in telecommunications. One shambly bit of evidence emerged regarding two companies in Chile during the Pinochet regime, where the figure 1.5 per cent was scrupulously extracted&mdash;I am sure&mdash;to try to demonstrate that something was there. The bottom line is that there is no empirical evidence to prove that privatisation itself improves the competitiveness, the efficiency or, in fact, the level of services provided to customers with respect to telecommunications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Opposition to the sale of Telstra is far and wide. The terms of reference were broad enough to bring in many issues. There is no evidence that the revenue return to the government from this privatisation would outweigh the returns that can be gleaned from dividends over a period of time. The record profits of Telstra this year only serve to reinforce that point and further expose the arguments of the government and the departments in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The impact on regional jobs is massive. A third of those jobs are to go. Many of my senatorial colleagues have spoken previously about the impact of this on jobs. This is where this inquiry has proved very important. It exposed project Mercury. If this inquiry had not occurred, we would not have known about the 24,000 jobs that would go throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Research and development is another crucial area where, through this inquiry and subsequent estimates hearings, we have been able to show that R&amp;D will suffer hugely from the move towards privatisation. It is an area that Telstra, in preparation for privatisation, is paring back and battening down&mdash;`removing the fat' in their language. But they are denying Australia the opportunity to expand the telecommunications industry and really look to the future to see what Telstra can provide to the public, the community, through public ownership of that organisation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to briefly comment on a matter that was highlighted in our local newspaper in Hobart today. I note that Senator Brown made formal a notice of motion today with respect to the proposed visit of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">USS Carl Vinson</EMPHASIS>  aircraft carrier to Hobart in a couple of weeks time. We have a situation, created by this minority government in Tasmania, particularly by the Tasmanian Greens, which I believe is working against the best wishes and the best interests of the people of Tasmania.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not the first visit that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Carl Vinson</EMPHASIS> has made to Hobart; it is the second. In fact, in its last visit I had the pleasure of being invited on board and participating in a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3979"> reception that was put on by the commander. I also had the pleasure of visiting the</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">USS Takoma</EMPHASIS> , a nuclear powered submarine, when it had previously visited Hobart.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make the point that some time ago the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee, particularly my colleague Senator Newman, took part in a report to the Senate on the safety or otherwise of visits to Australia by nuclear powered ships. It was a very comprehensive report. Some hundreds of pages were put together, using all the available information and advice that was given. It virtually has become the bible around Australia in relation to visits of nuclear powered vessels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Hobart, the capital of my home state of Tasmania, where there is one of the best harbours in Australia if not the world, an emergency management plan was put in place to deal with any vessel having problems&mdash;and I do not ever suspect that they would have problems, but if they did have&mdash;and ensuring that the safety of all residents of Hobart, including even those in hospitals, would be catered for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prior to the Senate election I was listening to Senator Brown one night&mdash;and he was not Senator Brown then but just Bob Brown&mdash;giving a bit of a policy speech and talking about what he was going to do. I noted with interest that he was highlighting the fact that, as a senator, he would work for Tasmania, promoting small business and jobs for young people. So far his track record and that of the Tasmanian Greens has been anti-development, anti-everything&mdash;and this is just another example of how they work against the interests of the people of Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For instance, it is estimated that the visit of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">USS Carl Vinson</EMPHASIS> will put something like $10 million into the pockets of the local economy. Just as an example, six local companies will be receiving over $1 million for the aircraft carrier's rubbish removal and ferry services. A Tasmanian company has won a contract to clean and paint the 317 metre carrier. Those two things in themselves are very significant for the Tasmanian work force. We have a very high unemployment rate in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Tasmania, and opportunities like this do not come along every day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have the ludicrous situation where the Tasmanian Greens and the Labor Party in Tasmania banded together to force the Speaker of the House of Assembly to send a letter to the American President saying, `We don't want you in Hobart' while on the very same day the Premier of Tasmania had to send a letter saying, `We do want you in Hobart.' It really is, as was pointed out in today's editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS>, `an absolute debacle'. It is a prime example of what can happen when you have minority governments, particularly where the tail is being wagged by the green movement. It just shows you what can happen and how a state like Tasmania can be disadvantaged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, there are positives to this particular visit. This is not the first visit of an American naval vessel. The reason given for personnel liking to come to Tasmania is that the people of Tasmania make them very welcome. I believe that, if a referendum were to be held on whether Tasmanians would like to continue to have visits by American naval vessels, there would be an overwhelming response.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I just wanted to refer to the nuclear debate in Hobart and point to the associated debacle. It has happened before; this is not the first occasion on which we have had these anti-development, anti-everything Greens trying to stop the local businesses receiving some well needed cash. For instance, I note that, when the aircraft carrier arrives, more than $1 million in cash will be taken out by ferry to the people on that aircraft carrier so that they can spend that money in Hobart&mdash;which will be to the benefit of the local community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that Senator O'Brien is in the chamber. I do not know whether he supports my views about the visits of the American navy and ships into Hobart. But I am very disappointed to see that the state Labor Party and the Greens joined together to create this situation where we have conflicting advice going to the American government. I just think, in the interests of Tasmania and small business in the area, it is a pretty poor effort <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3980"> that has been put up, particularly by the Tasmanian Greens.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This week the Economist Intelligence Unit released a report entitled, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's Foreign Investment Challenge: The Harsh Realities</EMPHASIS> . It outlined the views of managers from over 50 multi-national corporations on Australia as an investment destination. The report gained significant press in the national media. According to the report, Australia accounts for only one to two per cent of global sales, therefore we are not a high priority at the boardroom tables of multi-national corporations. One manager said that, since Australia only has one per cent of their sales market, we `get about one per cent of the board's attention'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia will never be a country which has a large domestic market. However, our location provides us with the opportunity to be a production and support site supplying the fast&hyphen;growing Asian region. The key point to come out of the report is that there is a real perception amongst managers that Australia lacks a coherent and consistent industry policy, both at the macro&hyphen;economic level and for many specific industries. The managers in the report complain that it is not obvious who is in charge of industry policy in Canberra. They say that `existing policies change too often'. I would like to quote one manager's experience. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We've spent four years building up exports from Australia and headquarters was beginning to accept that we were a viable sourcing site.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But in the government's scramble to cover its deficit it cuts the tariff concession order so we now pay a 3% import tax on materials that are not even produced in Australia. Policy changes like these seem to come out of the blue with no clear direction or aim and seem to totally ignore industry.</PARA>
<PARA>The hesitance of many multi&hyphen;nationals to invest in Australia because of a perceived lack of industry policy is concerning in light pf the report's revelation that many of the world's leading multi&hyphen;national corporations have already decided to put their next world&hyphen;scale plant in Asia&mdash;but are yet to decide where. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> This is a great opportunity and we must give them a reason to choose Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's irrational fear of industry policy should not prevent Australia from missing out on the huge export revenues that will flow from multi&hyphen;national corporations locating their regional manufacturing plants in this country. These plants will export to the entire region. The average multi&hyphen;national plans on more than tripling its sales in this region. This means huge export revenues for the countries where they choose to establish their headquarters. And the establishment of value&hyphen;adding, export&hyphen;orientated manufactured plants in Australia will create real jobs and contribute significantly to lifting our standard of living.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Strategic industry policy was pursued successfully by the previous Labor government. According to the report, 11 per cent of the firms interviewed were involved in the Button car plan, which lifted automotive exports from under $400 million in 1984 to $1.5 billion in 1995. Sixteen per cent were involved in factor F, which increased pharmaceutical industry exports to their current levels of $1.4 billion per year. Twenty seven per cent were involved in the successful partnership for development scheme. Other industry policies include the book bounty, which increased book exports by 200 per cent; and the shipbuilding bounty, which saw production rise nearly 200 per cent and exports grow by 150 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report's statement that the biggest magnet for multi-national corporations is a broad, cohesive industry policy should come as no surprise. Report after report, all by prominent organisations such as the World Bank, have said that a key reason for East Asia's stunning growth over the past three decades has been the effective industry policy of countries in that region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clear from the report that we are facing strong competition from Asian countries when multinational corporations consider where to locate. As the report says, `The Asian countries Australia competes against are all driven by industry policy and, if you want to win investment away from them, you have to focus on having a coherent industry policy.' <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3981"> Seventy&hyphen;four per cent of managers feel Australia does not have a clear industry policy. Seventy&hyphen;nine per cent believe we do not have a consistent industry policy and 72 per cent believe industry policy is not consistent across federal ministries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One senior manager explained that he had worked in a number of countries, but he found Australia's system of developing industry policy the strangest of all. He outlined how the industry department consulted industry whilst Treasury preferred to look at academic studies of economic studies of efficiency. He said managers did not know which department to believe, and described it as `a system guaranteed to create confusion'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clear from this report that there needs to be a debate in this country regarding the development of an effective industry policy. We should look at our competitors in the region and develop policies which will ensure that we meet the challenge of competition. The current idea of simply opening a textbook and following it to the letter does not work. The report specifically criticised `frequent government statements that they are not in the business of picking winners or providing "corporate welfare"'. Rather, it must be recognised that the government has a responsibility to create truly level playing fields. We must have the same concept of the level playing field as our Asian neighbours do. This means public policy directed towards assistance to high value, high yield, expanding export&hyphen;oriented manufacturing industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has a responsibility to nurture these key industries and a responsibility to ensure good economic policy that delivers results is followed, not some blind ideological pursuit. This report is a deafening warning bell to the government: unless you develop a strong industry policy, Australia will not attract the foreign investment which is so integral to the growth in our economy and, over time, the living standards of all Australians.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak this evening on a matter which recently came to my attention. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> It involves coverage on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Media Watch</EMPHASIS>  by Stuart Littlemore of a program which was put to air on 1 September this year by <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS> . That program involved a story involving the Christian Brothers. What has come to my attention has caused me a great deal of concern, to say the least. In fact, Stuart Littlemore described this whole affair as `breathtakingly dishonest'. What happened was that Geoff McMullan interviewed Brother Tony Shanahan, the provincial head of the Christian Brothers. During the course of the interview, he asked him:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We're talking about possible murder within the Christian Brothers.</PARA>
<PARA>The answer that Brother Shanahan gave was as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The evidence on the information I have is that yes, the allegation was made, but there is nothing, there's nothing, there is no other evidence to support that.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what Brother Shanahan said but that is not what <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS>  put on air as being the reply to the question. What in fact <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS>  did was it showed Brother Shanahan being at a loss for words, frowning and having to grasp a glass of water and take a drink from the glass. That was not his response to the question. In fact, what it gave the viewer was an impression of some sort of guilt, some sort of concern by Brother Shanahan, some sort of amazement or surprise. Indeed, that was not the answer that Brother Shanahan gave. That was not his response. The wrong segment was put in as the answer and passed off dishonestly as his response to that question. Of course, that misled any viewer who would be looking at that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It came to my attention that this had, in fact, been looked at by <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Media Watch</EMPHASIS> and I note that Stuart Littlemore said that Peter Meakin, Channel Nine's current affairs boss, declined an interview with <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Media Watch</EMPHASIS> in relation to this. I think it is quite a scandalous piece of journalism. Stuart Littlemore said that it really was not the interviewer's fault, as such. It was not Geoff McMullan's fault. It was, in fact, the fault of the producer who put the program together, and I take his point. I find this piece of journalism absolutely scandalous. I have a tape of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Media Watch</EMPHASIS> for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3982"> any of those senators who would like to watch it. I think that once you see it, and see how the deception occurred, you too would be most concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also wish to refer to the question of these so&hyphen;called unexplained deaths that were raised by the program. Brother Shanahan mentioned, in a letter dated 4 September 1996:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is perhaps significant that no other mainstream media have seen fit to pick up these stories over the last few years. They refer to four students who are buried at Bindoon and one who died in a fall at Tardun in 1949. Two of the students buried at Bindoon died in road accidents after they had left Bindoon and were brought back there for burial. The other two died in accidents, one falling under the wheel of a cart on the farm, and the other striking his head on the stairs as he fell from a balustrade down which he was sliding. The lad at Tardun was a sleep walker and was discovered one morning below an open verandah on the first floor where he slept, with other students. It is presumed that he walked over the edge of the balcony in his sleep and was killed in the fall.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In none of these cases did the examining doctor who signed the death certificate see fit to ask for an inquest. I am aware of no evidence which would cause us to re&hyphen;examine the circumstances of these deaths. I am aware of no&hyphen;one offering any eye witness testimony to contradict what we know of their deaths.</PARA>
<PARA>That is an account of what took place, but <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS>  put it in the context of a possible murder within the Christian Brothers. That is absolutely disgraceful because there is the explanation and, indeed, Brother Shanahan's answer that he gave to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS>  said that there was no evidence to show that there was any foul play afoot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that there was a letter written to the director of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS> by Professor Ivan Kennedy, who is a professor in agricultural and environmental chemistry from the University of Sydney. He is an old boy from Clontarf Boys Town. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I find it impossible to relate what I saw in your program last Sunday night with my very positive experiences at Clontarf for several years in the first half of the 1950s. My clear recollection is of a well run and caring enterprise of which the Christian Brothers have every right to be proud and with many achievements of which most of the boys certainly were. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>Professor Kennedy goes on to mention:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I have attended Perth on several occasions to attend Old Boys' reunions.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Other">Those old boys included a VC winner, a number of university graduates, business managers, senior civil servants and a host of others who have made a go of their lives.</PARA>
<PARA>That stands as testament to the fine work that the Christian Brothers have done in this country. I know that in this Senate there are several senators who are a product of their education and hard work. I find it despicable that we have this sort of journalism which tries to bring down such a fine institution and fine body of men.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I raise this tonight in the wake of the beatification of Edmund Rice, who is the founder of the Christian Brothers. He was beatified on Sunday, 6 October this year in Rome. I think it is fitting that he was beatified as the founder of the Christian Brothers. I will be talking on that matter on another day in this Senate. I certainly will be taking this matter of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS> up with the minister concerned. I will be bringing it to the attention of the producers of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS> because I think this is a matter which should not go without comment.

<STATE> (Tasmania)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(7.40 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this evening to speak in relation to an enterprise agreement which has been recently ratified by the enterprise commissioner in the state of Tasmania. The enterprise agreement relates to a number of businesses and is known as the Margate bakery enterprise agreement. This is one of a number of agreements which have been approved under the Tasmanian industrial relations system which operate to reduce the conditions and wages of employment of future employees, not those employees who are party to the making of the agreement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my view, there is a questionable morality operating with this sort of agreement. It has received some debate in the consideration of the report of the Senate Economics References Committee on the workplace relations <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3983"> bill which will no doubt be dealt with elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make the point that with agreements such as this, future employees have no recourse at law in relation to the signing away of their rights to wages and conditions otherwise prescribed by awards by employees who are not so affected. However, in this case, there was a very grave question raised with regard to the fairness of the bargaining process which took place with the making of this particular enterprise agreement which applies to three baking establishments in southern Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The agreement was drafted by a representative of the employer who was employed by the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and presented to the employees. Meetings were held at which a representative of that employer organisation attended and was the only source of information for the employees as to their rights and the impact of that agreement upon them. Subsequent to that meeting and during the process of a ballot of employees which was properly conducted in other respects, a representative of the Australian Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers Union sought to have distributed to employees a one page document which set out some of their rights and inviting them, if they had any questions on any matters, to contact the union.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is uncontested&mdash;and this matter has been raised before the enterprise commissioner and in correspondence that I am in possession of&mdash;that a representative of the employer advised the employee who received those documents to tear them up and throw them in the bin. The employer was concerned on the one hand to have the employer's view made clear to the employees but when there was an alternative view, albeit a one page document which was prepared by an official of the union, that was not to be seen by the employees. I suggest that in those circumstances there is a very questionable practice of fairness being followed by the employer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following that process, a young man employed in the business wrote to the enterprise commissioner in the context of a hearing which was being held, as I understand it, in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a home of either the employer or someone connected with the employer. That is where the hearing was held. This young man wrote to the enterprise commissioner setting out his concerns and sent a copy to the Tasmanian Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Cornish.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that letter the young man says a number of things. Because of my limited time I will seek to table a copy of the union notice I referred to, a copy of the letter of Mr Christopher Gard, a copy of correspondence from Mr Terry Edwards, the manager of industrial services for the Tasmania Chamber of Commerce and Industry Limited, and a copy of a letter which is from a Mrs Elaine Lincolne, the mother of the young man, Mr Christopher Gard. I seek leave to table those.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8O6">Senator O'BRIEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In relation to that correspondence, it is clear&mdash;and the young man makes quite a number of points&mdash;that he is unhappy with the process and the agreement. I think he is quite brave to have done what he did. He says, amongst other things:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The whole agreement revolves around changes that reduce wages and conditions of employment. This represents an insecure future for me because if the agreement succeeds I will probably lose my job so that some-one on a lesser rate of pay can be employed. If this is in fact not the case I don't see any reason for bringing it in in the first place. The other problem that it will cause is people doing the same work for different rates of pay and this will cause problems in the workplace because it is unfair.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I also have some concerns about the Employer having knowledge of a new proposed Baking Industry Award which I believe is nearing completion. I have been informed the majority of the new proposals have been agreed to by the Unions and the TCCI&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which is the employer organisation I referred to&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">on a `without prejudice' basis and discussions to resolve the few outstanding clauses has been listed for the first week in October.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We should have been told about this so that we could make real comparisons that related to the situation for the next 2 years and not on an award that will most likely be superseded in the near future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Also when a representative from the Union attempted to hand over some documentation to employees <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3984"> that would inform them of this new proposed award it was destroyed and not passed on. As a union member I was never given the opportunity to involve my representative in any way.</PARA>
<PARA>He finishes the letter by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am almost 20 years of age and have worked in the Bakery for 15 months&mdash;my first real job and I like it. I do not want to lose my job but I feel I should have an opportunity to voice my concerns.</PARA>
<PARA>Subsequent to that, because a copy was sent to the minister, the minister contacted an officer of his department, Mr Edwards of the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Mr Edwards responded questioning the process of writing to the minister in the circumstances and questioning the genuineness of the letter. He said in the letter, amongst other things:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Minister I believe . . . that Mr Gard's letter is something of a beat up and given the circulation list is probably more designed for its political impact rather than being the genuinely held concerns of an employee.</PARA>
<PARA>As I said, there is a great deal of information to deal with here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a response to that, the letter from the young man's mother, which I have tabled, says, amongst other things, that the letter had been sent to the minister because he was the minister responsible for the act under which the agreement was being reached. In reference to that letter&mdash;and I strongly urge senators to have a close look at these papers&mdash;it is clear that the young man's mother, Mrs Lincolne, is not an opponent to enterprise bargaining but rather an opponent to the unfair way in which this agreement was reached. It is a very considered letter and I strongly urge senators to have regard to it. This is, in my opinion, a very unfortunate set of circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In closing, I cannot help taking advantage of the opportunity to refer to some comments that were made during question time by Senator Alston. In a somewhat gratuitous comment he referred to failed union officials on this side of the Senate. It would be equally improper of me to be referring to members of the legal profession who sit on the other side of the chamber as failed members of the legal profession because they were in this chamber. It is rather that they are serving the nation at <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a higher level&mdash;not one which ought to be denigrated in this chamber.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator Alston</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Transport and Regional Development has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Airservices Australia, in an advertisement in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS>   on April 13 1996, invited registrations of interest for the supply of eleven major airport fire vehicles, with an option to supply a further four vehicles. This constituted the first step in a two step process. Step two will be to seek formal tenders from a short list of suppliers selected from organisations responding to the Invitation to Register Interest (ITR).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Twenty fire vehicles are being replaced. Fourteen of these were supplied by the Walter Truck Company of Canada and six smaller capacity Rapid Intervention Vehicles (RIVs) were supplied by Austral Denning Pty Ltd of Brisbane, Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Walter vehicles are between fourteen and eighteen years old, costly to maintain and do not meet International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards pertaining to water and comple <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> mentary agent (dry chemical powder) capacity. The acquisition of the new improved capability fire vehicles will result in the six RIVs becoming surplus to Rescue and Fire Fighting Service (RFFS) requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reduced ICAO remission factors applicable from January 2000 combined with Airservices' RFFS category changes due to increased aircraft size at certain airports preclude the continued use of the Walter vehicles as front line major attack fire vehicles. Furthermore, proprietary parts crucial to continued operation of the Walter vehicles must be custom engineered at significant cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Australian Government purchasing policy encourages Government Business Enterprises like Airservices Australia to maximise opportunities for Australian and New Zealand (ANZ) industry development through the inclusion of industry development criteria in purchasing decisions. To meet this requirement, tenderers for the supply of the fire vehicles will be required to provide, under separate cover, details of the ANZ industry proposals associated with their offers. The proposals will identify ANZ value&hyphen;added elements associated with supply of the fire vehicles including the component of local manufacture and the extent of technology transfer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Board and Management of Airservices Australia are conscious of Government policy concerning Australian industry involvement. Airservices Australia has, after consulting the Department of Industry, Science and Tourism (DIST), included an Industry Impact Statement which addresses industry development criteria in its ITR documentation. This action was taken in recognition of the importance of the Fire Vehicle Replacement Project to ANZ suppliers, notwithstanding that there is no formal requirement for Airservices to do so for projects under $30 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) It is anticipated that tenders for the supply of fire vehicles will be sought in October 1996 and the contract for supply of the fire vehicles awarded in June 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) It is not intended that a minimum local content requirement be specified as a condition of contract. However, tenderers will be requested to specify the component of local manufacture or supply that will be included in the fire vehicles offered, the supplier's name and the approximate contract value. If parts/components are to be obtained from ANZ suppliers and/or assembled in an ANZ facility then tenderers are required to specify the name of the assembler and the approximate contract value. Any distribution and/or ANZ agency relationship is also to be identified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) All manufacturers (Australian manufacturers included) must be able to demonstrate that they are <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3987"> offering airport fire vehicles which are proven in operational service and which require minimal design changes to meet Airservices' functional requirement without the need to  manufacture and test a prototype vehicle prior to commencement of full scale vehicle production. Non&hyphen;proven variants to proven products will be evaluated by Airservices Australia in this context.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(8) Airservices Australia will evaluate offers from manufacturers claiming to meet its functional requirements on the basis of best value for money against criteria which will be published in its Request for Tender (RFT). A part of this evaluation may include visiting overseas manufacturers to substantiate claims made by tenderers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) It is expected that a team of four officers may undertake such a trip.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) The timing of the trip will depend on the progress and findings of the tender evaluation, however a March 1997 departure is anticipated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) The team is expected to include one Operational RFFS Specialist, one Technical RFFS Specialist, the Project Manager and a Union Representative (member of the United Firefighters Union).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) The companies to be visited are yet to be identified as this will depend on the findings of the Tender Evaluation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) As per (d) above, however companies expected to submit tenders are located in Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom, United States, Germany and Austria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(f) The duration of the trip will depend on the Tender Evaluation findings, particularly the number and location of companies to be visited, however the duration of the trip is not expected to exceed four weeks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(g) The estimated cost of the trip is in the order of $60,000.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The role of regional universities in providing access for rural and regionally based students has been recognised by the Government in its Budget package. All publicly funded higher education institutions, including those in regional Australia, will have time to plan and adapt as the reduction to grants has been deliberately timed to fit university planning timeframes. Moreover, by applying the same proportional reduction to the operating grant on all institutions the Government has ensured that all are treated in the fairest way possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The flow of funding to the regional campuses of individual institutions is a matter for the universities themselves. While the Commonwealth provides the bulk of university funds, higher  <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3991"> education institutions are essentially autonomous organisations that are responsible for the distributions of funds between campuses based on their own assessment of priorities and needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Budget Statement on Higher Education the Government has stated that the needs of regional institutions will be given special consideration. The Government has indicated that it will be prepared to consider specific proposals for assistance to help the process of adjustment to the new funding levels if necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The allocation of funds to the Bunbury campus of Edith Cowan University will be based on the University's own assessment of its priorities and needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) There is no suggestion that the Bunbury campus of Edith Cowan University and other regional campuses are likely to close, or that the range of courses available to regional students will be reduced as a direct result of the relatively modest reductions to universities operating grant which were announced in the Budget.</PARA></ANSWER></ANSWER.TO.QON></ANSWERS.TO.QUESTIONS></HANSARD>
