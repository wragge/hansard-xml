<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to Senator Alston, the Minister for Communications and the Arts. Minister, do you stand by your statements that there is no windfall gain arising from Telstra's record profit of $2.3 billion for 1995-96 and that suggestions that part of that profit should be used for such purposes as funding the Natural Heritage Trust are `spurious economics`?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Do you want the answer or not? The operating profit after tax and minority interest was $2.3 billion in 1996. In June 1995, that figure was $1.755 billion. If you look at the dividend figure of $1.368 billion, you find that is only about $74 million more than the implicit figure which we had budgeted for. In other words, there is a very minor increase.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Look, I know it is a bit simplistic and your approach does not readily lend itself to this sort of analysis, but there are two elements: one is the dividend payment and the other is the increase in corporate taxation. Senator Kernot was arguing that the increase in corporate tax was very significant because she said it was something like 76 per cent compared with 7.9 per cent last year. The fact is that that 7.9 per cent did not relate to Telstra. That is an overall increase in the level of corporate taxation and that disguises a multitude of ups and downs, pluses and minuses. It certainly does not tell you anything about the level of increase in Telstra's corporate taxation contributions last <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> year, nor does it tell you what its increase might be this year.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am in the process of explaining it to you. It is also very important to recognise that, because you are talking about the aggregate of contributions to revenue, there is no such thing as a windfall in this situation any more than there might be if BHP suddenly had a record result and increased funds were available. You cannot simply say, `Well, that means we got more than we expected; we can therefore spend that money.' You have to balance this out. You have to look at all the pluses and minuses, as I said in my release yesterday.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry, I cannot hear but I presume we will have this debate in the MPI. To the extent that the increase is due to an increase in its market share, then that is at the expense of its competitors. You may well argue that that means that their contribution to corporate taxes would be commensurately less. So there is no basis for saying that a one-off increase in the level of corporate taxation constitutes a windfall gain in this area any more than it does anywhere else.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same applies to the dividend payment. The dividend payment is substantially taken into account in the budget projections. In fact, we have already received 50 per cent of that figure announced last Friday. So that has already been factored in and received. The next amount will not be payable until December this year and that will then take account of the lag effect. That will be part of what was announced on Friday as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have to remember that about 90 per cent of the total increase in operating profit is due to an increase in revenue&mdash;about $1.1 billion&mdash;and efficiencies constitute less than 10 per cent. On that basis, you cannot possibly assume that this is anything other than a snapshot of the performance of one corporation at a particular point in time. It tells you nothing about next year and how it will perform then.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have made it clear to you: the dividend was broadly anticipated in budget statement No. 4. The level of corporate taxes is quite a spurious figure because it is not related to Telstra's level of increase; it is related to the overall level of corporate tax payable in the last financial year. That is no more a windfall gain than any increased performance by any other company. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></TALK.START></ANSWER>

I thank the minister for that straightforward explanation of how he stood by his statements that to use part of the profit of Telstra for a purpose such as funding the Natural Heritage Trust was spurious economics. Given that you have made that statement, Senator Alston, will you now repudiate the Acting Prime Minister, Mr Fischer, and his statement that was reported on page 1 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  this morning that Telstra has delivered a couple of hundred million extra to the budget which could be spent on other policies?

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FF4">Senator CHAPMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Assistant Treasurer. I draw the minister's attention to yet another irresponsible media release made last week by Senator Sherry alleging that the government's superannuation policies have caused uncertainty within the industry and the broader community. Can the minister advise the Senate on the impact of these government policies and, in particular, the government's commitment to choice in superannuation&mdash;something that Labor did not recognise as a priority during its failed 13 years?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="3476" SPEAKER="Short, Sen Jim" NAMEID="DJ4" ELECTORATE="VIC" PARTY="LP" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Chapman for his question. It gives me another opportunity to point out to the Senate&mdash;with regret, I must say&mdash;how much Senator Sherry has become the Labor Party spokesman for superannuation scaremongering. He has been at it for weeks and weeks now. In the most disgraceful way, he has deliberately put fear into the hearts of thousands of people approaching retirement. He did it again when he made a statement on Friday in relation to the opt&hyphen;out provisions that the government has announced for very low income earners, so far as the superannuation guarantee arrangements are concerned, whereby, under the budget announcement that the government has made, someone earning between $450 and $900 a month will be able to opt out of the superannuation guarantee arrangements and instead receive, in lieu, wages to the equivalent amount.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that our policy is based on a very simple concept that Labor seems to have no comprehension of at all&mdash;and that is the concept called choice. We believe that Australians are intelligent enough to think for themselves and have the basic fundamental right to be able to make a choice in areas such as this. True to form, Senator Sherry seems to take no regard of this and seems to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have no comprehension at all of this fundamental thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If a person is receiving less than $900 a month and if they wish to have additional wage or salary to pay their rent or to meet essential living expenses, that will be their choice. Labor says that they should not have that choice, despite the fact that they may be coming from a situation where they are battling to make ends meet, where every dollar might help them to make ends meet. Labor says, `No, we are not going to let you do that.' That applies to casual workers, to people who are in and out of the work force&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="NEWMAN" NAMEID="BE4">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator Newman</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Women on low pay.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And, as Senator Newman says, to women on low pay or part-time arrangements. `No choice,' says the Labor Party. We believe there should be choice and that people should be free to negotiate with their employer to have the additional income instead of superannuation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We acknowledge&mdash;and we have acknowledged in the budget papers&mdash;that up to 80 per cent of people who qualify for opting out may in fact choose to do so. But that is a matter for their own intelligent choice. Under the government's policy, people will continue to benefit from the superannuation guarantee when their income moves above $900 a month, and if they exercise a choice and they think it is in their best interest, if their income is less than $900 a month, to stay in the superannuation guarantee arrangements, then they will do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would ask Senator Sherry: why is he so against letting Australian people make up their minds in this respect? Why is he so determined not to allow people choice? It is the old approach of Labor that the state knows better than the individual what is in the individual's best interest. That is one of the fundamental differences between this side of politics and your side of politics. That is one of the fundamental reasons why you were so comprehensively thrown out of office on 2 March. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam President, my question is directed to Senator Alston, Minister for Communications and the Arts. Are you aware that Mr Blount, the Chief Executive Officer of Telstra, on radio last Friday in answering a question about Telstra moving jobs offshore to the Philippines said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, look, if it is cheaper we will do it&mdash;and if it's best practice.</PARA>
<PARA>Will you be taking any action as the minister responsible for Telstra to keep Telstra jobs in Australia? And will you rein in Telstra's mania for downsizing that will see 22,000 Telstra jobs disappear over the next three years?</PARA></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="3477" SPEAKER="Alston, Sen Richard" NAMEID="LD4" ELECTORATE="VIC" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Communications and the Arts" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not see those reported remarks of Mr Blount, but I did have a discussion with Mr Blount late last week, in which I canvassed with him the one line that was contained in the Senate report that suggested that perhaps operator assisted service jobs might be taken offshore&mdash;indeed, I think, to the Philippines. The answer I got was, firstly, that Mr Blount had not been involved <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3478"> in any such discussions and, secondly, that he was not interested in proposals that, on the face of it, did not seem to offer any significant benefits in terms of productivity and certainly did not seem to be in Telstra's best interests if it was concerned to retain an image of Australian&hyphen;ness.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What was said at the press conference in the context of announcing the record profit result was that over the next two years there would be additional reductions in employment levels. There is nothing surprising about that. Indeed, as we know, between 1991 and 1994 Telstra reduced its work force by about the same level as we are now talking about&mdash;in other words, about 25,000 jobs. The unions themselves have conceded on a number of occasions that technology gains and productivity improvements will inevitably result in job losses&mdash;they have factored that into the equation. Both Ian McLean and Colin Cooper have said that&mdash;and both are from the CEPU.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite clear that there is also a need to address efficiency problems and, as I have indicated in relation to the announced figure the other day, only a very small proportion of that could be attributed to any gains in efficiency. And unless you get efficiencies in place, Senator Childs, through you Madam President, you will not be able to deliver the world&hyphen;class service that we all want; you will not be able to get lower prices and better quality of service; you will not be able to get their access lines per employee up above 135 to the 200&hyphen;plus that you get in New Zealand and even close to 300 for the RBOC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In other words, it is very important that Telstra is allowed to make commercial decisions. That is what the 1991 act is all about. It is not a matter of interfering and giving instructions; it is a matter of Telstra exercising its own sensitivity on these issues. Quite clearly, Telstra will be cognisant of the need to ensure that it is not simply reducing employment levels by head count and that it is doing it only in areas where it will contribute to the efficiency of the system and enable it to compete much more effectively after 1 July next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are all very important issues because telecommunications costs are the second&hyphen; <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> largest cost input for most businesses after wages and salaries and, unless you have an efficient Telstra, unless it is able to compete against newcomers into the game, it will be very much handicapped. You put management in positions to make those hard decisions. No&hyphen;one gets any joy out of reducing labour in whatever sector it might be, but if there is one industry in which you would like to be if your job were at risk, it would be in a sector where the growth rate is about 18 per cent. The telecommunications industry is growing at that level and, as Ian McLean himself said, if jobs go from Telstra, they are likely to go to the private sector&mdash;in other words, you can confidently expect that there will be a huge demand for jobs from the telecommunications industry. That was said by SPAN and ATUG to the Senate committee. I am sorry that you chose to ignore that because it is very important evidence. To the extent that people are unable to be employed by Telstra, their prospects of being employed elsewhere are very good. And that is one of the great virtues of this industry and why you want to have as much efficiency as possible. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Back on 15 November 1993, the then minister for communications, David Beddall, announced that Labor had agreed to proposals for a sensible, managed approach to the introduction of further competition. He went on to say that the review would be conducted in 1996&hyphen;97, with terms of reference consistent with the findings of the national competition policy review. He also said that it was the government's view that a public monopoly must justify the continuation of its monopoly position. Indeed, we went to the election matching Labor's promise.

The basis on which we will be conducting that review is to ensure that all Australians are provided with better and more efficient postal services. We were the only party that went to the election promising to improve postal services to regional and rural Australia. Indeed, we are in the process of delivering on those promises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is appalling is that three days later Mr Crean apparently got rolled by Senator Schacht, who then proceeded to put out a press release saying that the Opposition had declared it was not interested in supporting any changes to the present operating rules and regulations of Australia Post. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unlike many other countries in the world, Australia Post pays a dividend to the Australian government.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know whether he meant that other countries in the world pay dividends to the Australian government or whether Australia Post pays dividends to other countries in the world. Putting aside the tortuous grammar of the whole release, it is clear from this that Senator Schacht simply is not interested in good public policy. The opposition, presumably, has reneged on that longstanding commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">None of that is surprising because if you had read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian </EMPHASIS>of 29 June you would have seen an interview called `Ordinary people'. I have to say that it was about very ordinary people&mdash;about Labor people who were suffering mightily from not being able to rule as they had presumed they were born to do. On that occasion, Senator Schacht said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some of us were never overly sucked in by the Cabinet process. We always felt there was too much time debating the minutiae of administration and not enough pure politics.</PARA>
<PARA>Overlooking for a moment the fact that he was never in cabinet so he was not in there debating anything, what that tells you is that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3480"> he is not interested in any shape or form about improving the lot of people in rural and remote areas and about benefiting consumers. He is simply interested in a very tawdry and tacky game of running scare campaigns, playing politics, not looking at the detail of issues, rolling ministers, like Mr Crean, and shadow ministers when they have the temerity to suggest that there might be a constructive approach based on their own announcement three years earlier.</PARA>

Isn't it true that this $840 million, combined with the $160 million that the Department of Finance estimates that the sale would actually cost if it went ahead, surely gives you your $1 billion? So shouldn't you immediately move to set up the Natural Heritage Trust Fund some 18 months earlier than planned? Shouldn't this money be allocated as a priority to fix all those environment problems and all those issues you have come into this place and talked about so eloquently for the last few months?

What plans does the government have to make Australia's exports more competitive?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Ian Macdonald for his question. Senator Macdonald, I can recall, was one of those who for years was telling Labor, when they were in government, that they had failed to appreciate some essential facts&mdash;that is, that our export economy is linked within the efficiencies of our domestic economy&mdash;and that a whole range of government policies under Labor were in fact making it more difficult for our exporters to compete effectively within the region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What Labor did was hide this failure to gain share within the fact that a greater share of our exports were going to the region. That was happening for a whole range of things&mdash;principally because of the growth within the region, so the markets were bigger and there was more opportunity. But, as a greater share of our exports were going to Asia, we were being outcompeted with others and our share of exports to Asia was in fact falling. That has been reiterated today by the research that has been published under the names of Professor Drysdale and Dr Lu.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We said time and time again to Labor&mdash;which of course would not listen because Senator Gareth Evans, as he then was, and successive trade ministers simple would not listen&mdash;that the problem was that we were not sufficiently competitive at the domestic economy. That is where, by contrast, we are putting in such great efforts. Firstly, we are trying to reduce the cost of business, so <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3487"> critical to Australian business being competitive internationally.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a matter of enormous concern to Australia as a whole, particularly those listeners who depend on a daily basis on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation services to bring them news and entertainment, and to focus on what is happening in the world and happening in other parts of Australia, and also what is happening at a local level for them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has embarked on an ideological war to gut the ABC. It said it in the opening comments of the terms of reference of an inquiry into the ABC. The terms of reference state: `The government seeks a more focused role for the ABC.' Perhaps that more focused role for the ABC is part of the continuing attack by the Prime Minister and other ministers on the ABC. Those attacks continued as late as last week in the other place where the Prime Minister accused the ABC again of misrepresenting him and quoting him out of context. That is something that he has done consistently over quite a period of time. Politicians from time to time make those assertions but none of them have gone to the extent that the current Prime Minister has in his battle, his private war, with the ABC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was announced earlier in the year, long before the budget came out, that the ABC would receive cuts to the tune of $11 million and further cuts this financial year to the tune of $55 million&mdash;a gutting of the ABC. Over four years, that is going to amount to a total of $209 million, which no organisation, no matter how well it is run, can sustain in the short term without some dramatic changes to the services it is providing to the public. We are seeing already those services being cut back. But that is only the tip of the iceberg. It is going to happen more and more. Possibly even those services that are near and dear to the Deputy Prime Minister, the services that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> he was so underwhelmed with in yesterday's television program, might too be the target, the victim, of the cutbacks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, very importantly, once these cuts that have been announced are in place and are hurting and depriving Australians of many services that the ABC was previously offering, there is a very comprehensive inquiry into the ABC, chaired by Mr Mansfield. That inquiry has so far attracted about 11,000 submissions. It was open for people to put forward their views only for a short period of time. As we all know in this place, people are very reluctant to put paint to paper, to put their views forward&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon, Senator McKiernan and Senator Schacht jumped up and told us how this government was taking away the work of the ABC as a general transmitter around Australia. I am glad Senator McKiernan mentioned what I was going to say. When your party was in government in 1994, without talking to anyone, without having any real inquiry, they took away the basic radio facilities in the Pilbara, the Kimberleys and the central desert of Western Australia&mdash;an area bigger in size than New South Wales. The only communication they had on any sort of radio was on VLW31&mdash;short wave transmitter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All that was needed was a lousy $2 million to replace a transmitter that was put in originally in 1936. Senator Bishop, having done union work in the far region, may have heard about this. Two million dollars was needed to replace that transmitter, but the previous government took the easy option; they just switched it off and left it off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The complaint originated from around your area, Senator McKiernan&mdash;from around Wanneroo. The old transmitter was interfering with television and FM radio in the Wanneroo area. When the complaint was made about the interference, what did the last government do? Instead of spending $2 million on setting up a new transmitter a bit further out so that it wouldn't interfere with services to people in Wanneroo, where Senator McKiernan lives&mdash;I do not know whether he works there, but he certainly lives there&mdash;and keeping the whole of the Pilbara on radio, the previous government arbitrarily switched it off and left it off. It wiped out transmission not only to the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Pilbara but also to ships travelling out as far as Sri Lanka. It wiped out transmission halfway into the Northern Territory. Without any reference to those centres at all, you wiped out the only dinkum radio transmission they could rely on.

The ABC transmission in that section of the Pilbara, the Kimberleys, and the central desert, where there is a lot of mining to come, has been wiped out. Your government was responsible for that in 1994. They would not listen; they would not spend that $2 million to get it back on air.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as the future of the Pilbara is concerned, I am working on the minister for communications to get that service, which provided radio transmission since 1936, reinstated.

<TIME.STAMP>(3.23 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator Alston, had his own inquiry into the ABC. It commenced in 1994 and published its report in March 1995. It was the Senate select committee into the ABC. As we all know, what Senator Alston wanted on that occasion was to really do a job on the ABC management. The report was entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Our ABC</EMPHASIS> . Of course, most people thought `Our ABC' meant the people's ABC but we now know that Senator Alston would like it to be his ABC.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The attitude that Senator Alston has adopted since becoming minister is completely at odds with what he said in the majority report of that committee. I would like to refresh Senator Alston's memory about a few of the things he said about such issues as funding for the ABC. Get a load of this: on page 94 of the majority report that Senator Alston chaired, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ABC base funding by 1996/97 will be approximately $35 million greater than if the efficiency dividend had been applied. This enables efficiency gains to be applied to improving output.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effect of triennial funding has been to provide the ABC with stable and predictable funding over the last seven years.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All major political parties support the triennial funding initiative. As outlined above, it provides the ABC with the ability to plan over a longer period while at the same time allowing it to retain any profits arising from its commercial activities.</PARA>
<PARA>What did this minister do when he got into government? He refuted those observations and commitments that he made at the time. He has imposed the efficiency dividend on the ABC and has wiped out triennial funding. The committee majority report, which was due essentially to Senator Alston who was driving it, said on page 96:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The continued exemption from the efficiency dividend helps provide greater planning certainty for the ABC's capital works program and is therefore supported by the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Carr and I, in the minority report, supported the continuation of triennial funding and the continuation of the exemption from the efficiency dividend. We also supported the continuation of real funding levels for the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ABC, the very same things that those who wrote the majority report committed themselves to and that the government committed itself to on election night.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since then we have seen the greatest example of hypocrisy and backflip by you in this government&mdash;and God knows we have seen a heck of a lot of them. You announced that funding would be slashed by $66 million and future funding levels were put at great risk because of your announcements. In one fell swoop you undermined the confidence of the ABC and its employees, and the many hundreds of thousands of people in this country who rely upon the ABC, listen to it and support its independence. On page 98 of that report, again you stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ABC needs surety of continued funding in order to provide the range of services expected under its statutory obligations. It is therefore incumbent on both the ABC and Government to make it very clear their intentions and requirements so as to ensure that all activities are undertaken on the basis of complete transparency and full accountability, without any diversion of funds from the Charter activities.</PARA>
<PARA>Minister, why did you say that in March 1995 and renege on it 12 months later when you cut the funding to the ABC without any prior warning? You cut funds to the ABC at the same time as you set up an inquiry under Mr Mansfield with respect to looking at charter activities and other matters of the ABC. At page 157 of the report you stated in your concluding remarks:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite the problems which the Committee identified in the ABC, the Committee believes that the basic structure of the ABC is sound and that the organisation is considerably stronger and more relevant to the Australian community now than it was ten years ago. The Committee is confident that the ABC has the ability to overcome the problems which it has identified, and that the ABC is strongly placed to meet the challenges ahead.</PARA>
<PARA>They were your words in March 1995, Minister. Why is it that now you have destroyed confidence within the ABC, you have drastically slashed their funding and you have put at risk the independence and integrity of this great Australian broadcaster? <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

I can assure Senator Short that I and the opposition will look at that explanation very closely.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do think it is worth saying here and recalling that when the government was in opposition, when Senator Short and his colleagues were on this side of the chamber, they used to rail against the then Labor administration for missing deadlines and not complying with returns to order, even if it was only a matter of hours. Those senators who were in this chamber during the life of the previous government would know that that is the case. It is incumbent on the coalition, now that it finds itself in government, to explain why these deadlines are no longer important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would want to see the government lift its game on this particular matter. This has been an extraordinarily sloppy and unimpressive performance on this return to order. The government did not comply with it when asked to by the Senate, took two months to organise itself and then, of course, failed to comply with all aspects of the return to order. Time and time again, Senator Short has to come in with even more threadbare and world weary excuses for not complying with these orders of the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we need an undertaking from the government that this approach to returns to order will not be repeated. As I have said previously in relation to these matters, the opposition intends to be very vigilant to ensure that the government does comply with the reasonable returns to order that are determined by this chamber.</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The continuing ideological determination of the Government to proceed with the sale of one&hyphen;third of Telstra despite Telstra's outstanding performance in respect of profitability and efficiency in public ownership.</PARA>
<PARA>It is indeed a matter of urgency that we have this debate this afternoon. We have to do all in our power to force this government to think again about its ideological obsession with the privatisation of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bit by bit, the spurious arguments that this government has mounted month after month are being dismantled. No matter what the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator Alston, might say that Mr Blount is saying, the fact of the matter is that the government has relied on three main arguments to persuade us to allow it to sell Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, it has said that this will lead to an increase in public savings, but that has been debunked by this government's own National Commission of Audit. The commission rejected the cashflow based accounting method used by this government, saying that it does not give a true picture of its value.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the government has told us time and time again that we need to privatise it because that will benefit consumers. It does not say that it means business consumers; it pretends that it is all consumers. But this argument too has been demolished by the simple fact that the government wants to bring forward legislation that will put in place regulation, because regulation&mdash;not privatisation&mdash;is the key to safeguarding consumer interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But thirdly, and most of all, this government has relied very heavily on the argument of efficiency. That argument has been shot down over time, but particularly on Friday when Telstra told us that it has reduced its costs per line to eight per cent below the world average and that those costs are falling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today Senator Alston added the other argument when he lectured us that you cannot <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3502"> do anything about spending this windfall, which does not really exist, because you might erode the budget bottom line. Senator Hill brought out this argument as well. I want to take one second to ask about the National Party's attack on the budget bottom line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about the National Party's opposition to the reef tax? What about its reintroduction of the shipping grants, with $32 million to BHP? What about its maintenance of the highly inefficient diesel fuel rebate to the tune of $1.3 billion? The Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Fischer, wants to spend this windfall&mdash;which Senator Alston and the Treasurer, Mr Costello, say does not exist&mdash;on the people's convention. But I think Mr Fischer can read the budget papers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Treasurer Costello said in question time in the other place today that I have made an error about my claim of a windfall. I do not believe that I have. I believe that, based on the year to year result announced on Friday, Telstra has contributed an extra $840 million in dividends and company taxes over what it did the year before. Yes, part of that has already been paid into Treasury coffers late last financial year, and now the rest will be paid. But it is more than was forecast in the budget&mdash;ask Tim Fischer&mdash;and that is the point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How much more Treasury will receive will depend on Telstra's half year statement after December. But the only way the Treasury forecast of 2.7 per cent dividend payment and the 7.9 per cent company tax payment could be met&mdash;the only way we could reach that forecast&mdash;is if there were a massive reduction in Telstra profitability over the next six months. Mr Blount said on Friday that this will not happen; Telstra investment will rise and its costs will fall. Is the minister predicting a massive slump for Telstra over the next six months, because that is the only way that this government's conservative estimates on forecasting can be met. Treasury has a very poor record on this, having underestimated company tax receipts for four years. It has also understated Telstra and Australia Post dividends for the last two years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us return to the efficiency argument. No matter what Senator Alston might say in his <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> remarks to come, this government has lectured us ad nauseam on Telstra's inefficiencies. They have talked Telstra down month after month. I can quote Senator Alston on 6 May, when he said that the reason his government wanted privatisation was that `it forces efficiencies on the company'. Senator Short said on 7 May:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fundamental reason for the partial privatisation of Telstra is to make Telstra more efficient and competitive.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Peter Costello on 1 August:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principal reasons for asset sales are greater efficiency and better services.</PARA>
<PARA>Let us look at the matter of the efficiency of Telstra in public ownership. The fact is that Telstra has dramatically improved efficiency and productivity in recent years. A study coordinated by the Industry Commission last year found that Telstra had reduced its prices by 16 per cent in real terms since 1989&hyphen;90 while doubling labour productivity, and that it has increased payments to government by more than 60 per cent since 1990&hyphen;91. The Bureau of Industry Economics estimates that Telstra's total factor productivity, which measures both labour and capital productivity, grew at an average rate of 6.3 per cent between 1979&hyphen;80 and 1993&hyphen;94.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point is that these achievements are well above the national average and have been made at the same time as maintaining Telstra's community service obligations. If you look at some further facts from Telstra's announcement on Friday, you find that Telstra's unit costs have been cut by 10 per cent during the past financial year and are now eight per cent below the average for world telecommunications companies. These figures come from a cost efficiency benchmarking in a study by the consultant group Mercer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about the other measures of success? There is a return on capital of 22.9 per cent and a return on assets of 17.9 per cent. These are both healthy indicators and we should remember, when dealing with the government's attempts to talk Telstra down and talking about after 1997, that BZW, allowing for a 20 per cent loss of market share, still says that Telstra will have an average profit <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3503"> of about 16 per cent over the next few years. I put to the Senate that we are asking the government to think again about their ideological obsession with privatisation. There have been no decent economic arguments advanced to this stage. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was waiting for the substantive arguments. BZW's analysis today states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cost reduction program has not yet had effect. Telstra has begun to address its cost issues, but results are too early to impact.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is fairly important to recognise. The quotes that Senator Kernot referred to, which presumably are from Alan Kohler's latest article, relate to the return on assets and the return on capital. They are not the most relevant indicators of efficiency. One needs to look at return on equity. Telstra could have done a lot better in that regard. Its return on equity was 17.9 per cent and world's best practice levels are much higher. Telecom New Zealand has a return on equity of 34 per cent and AT&amp;T has a return on equity of 35 per cent. In other words, it is almost double Telstra's return. If Telstra's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation were as high as Telecom New Zealand then the bottom line would have increased by many billions. On it goes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does not prove anything to argue that somehow, over the last six or so years Telstra has reduced prices, there has been an increase in payments to the government of 60 per cent or that the total factor productivity has gone up by an average of 6.3 per cent, which is well above the average in the economy, because we are dealing with a unique industry. Technological changes come along almost every second day and they have dramatic effects on the increase in productivity and performance. Cable modems are supposed, for example, to increase the rate of access for data by 100 times. Digital switching has made an enormous difference, as has optical fibre transmission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telcos around the world are gaining very significantly from technological progress but not from labour market efficiency&mdash;and certainly not when they have the access lines <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> per employee ratio that Telstra currently has. Telstra acknowledges this. It has set itself the task of trying to make those improvements. You will never make those improvements if you simply allow yourself to be at the beck and call and whim of the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government does not believe in intervention. You know what Labor was like. A few years ago they had to approve every press release that was put out by Telstra. That is a recipe for disaster. You would have the government telling what is supposedly a commercial operation what to do and how to do it. That is why you have regulation, but they ignore the regulation. They want to give directions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am telling you what he said eight days ago. If you read his article carefully, you will find that what he is really saying is that the timing is not quite right. He would rather do it later rather than sooner because he thinks that there is a lot of money to be made by the government if Telstra is going to continue to return boom profits. That is not an argument against privatisation. That is simply saying that you can get your hands on the cash earlier and spend it in all sorts of ways now, profligate and otherwise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The longer the process takes, the more capacity you have to take advantage of that. In any event, whatever price you get&mdash;whether it is $8 billion or $11 billion as some commentators are now saying&mdash;it means that you are capitalising on that future income earning stream. You are not wasting it. You are missing out on it. It is simply paid in as the net present value of that stream of earnings. That money is then available to do whatever you feel is necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We take the view that our responsibility is to pay off the public debt rather than tip it in as the previous government did with all the privatisations that it embraced. I think Senator Kernot put out a press release on the airports corporation saying, `Yet again another privatisation supported by Labor.' In other words, they have privatised everything that moves. They would have been in this like Flynn if they had half a chance. The only reason they are not doing it is sheer naked political opportunism. It suits their political purposes to fabricate an argument that says that this is not good for Australia. It is good for Australia.</PARA>

First, state ownership in the dynamic global telecommunications market is an anachronism among developed nations where a competitive environment exists. Second, the nation pays a price for state ownership because of the lack of a vibrant telecommunications sector and the Stock Exchange restricts the development of capital markets.

I dealt earlier on with the conflict of interest argument between government as regulator and government as shareholder beneficiary.

Today, in trying to give the Senate an answer&mdash;which was gobbledegook at its worst&mdash;for over four minutes he tried to explain how $600 million increased profit, an increased dividend of several hundred million to the Australian government and increased taxes to the Australian government did not mean anything; there was no improvement.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last Friday night on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS>, Alan Kohler&mdash;the commentator Senator Alston has already quoted today as saying he has generally been in favour of privatisation&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. Then again, in the interview with Kerry O'Brien, Alan Kohler said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . they've now got their unit costs, their costs, operating expenses per line, below the average of the world telecommunications companies for the first time. Previously, like a year ago, they were well above the average and now, thanks to that 10 per cent cut, they're 8 per cent below the average of the world and they're planning now to stay there.</PARA>
<PARA>They were Kohler's remarks, that they have got their costs down and that that is improving the bottom line. He was asked about what impact this excellent result from Telstra <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3507"> would have on people like Senator Alston and the government, and Alan Kohler said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, I do think Senator Alston is probably feeling a bit uncomfortable here. He has been arguing&mdash;and it's almost his only argument that's left&mdash;that Telstra has to be sold in order for it to become efficient, otherwise it will get trampled on by British Telecom and AT&amp;T. Well, clearly, Telstra is becoming efficient now, so that argument is falling over.</PARA>
<PARA>The major argument to justify privatisation which this minister has put in this place for six months&mdash;that Telstra is an inefficient and unprofitable organisation&mdash;has now fallen over, says Alan Kohler.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another argument that has been put by some supporters of privatisation, including the minister, is that after 1 July next year there will be a much more open market in telecommunications, that other carriers will be able to start and that Telstra will not be able to beat all this extra competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the Senate inquiry, those of us on the committee asked a number of people, including those in favour of privatisation, what they thought the future of Telstra would be post&hyphen;July next year. Overwhelmingly, whilst they could not give an accurate figure to the last decimal point, they all conceded that Telstra would maintain its position as the dominant carrier&mdash;80 per cent of the market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the report which BZW produced earlier this year about Telstra&mdash;which the minister just quoted in his remarks&mdash;it said about the 1 July 1997 deregulated market:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New carriers after July 1997 and the larger service providers in aggregate will take a gradually increasing share of the corporate, business, long distance and international markets (in the order of 5&hyphen;10% over five years).</PARA>
<PARA>On that figure Telstra would probably drop to just over 80 per cent of the total market. Then the report goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Telstra's own growth is likely to continue to exceed that of these players in aggregate.</PARA>
<PARA>So BZW, in favour of privatisation, certainly made it clear that, despite the extra competition post&hyphen;July next year, Telstra will still be growing stronger. Even though its percentage point of the marketplace may drop five or 10 per cent, as the market for telecommunications is growing&mdash;according to the evidence <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> we had before us in the inquiry, and no&hyphen;one has disputed it&mdash;at about 15 per cent per annum, Telstra's revenues, turnover, profit, size, the value of its company, will go up accordingly. It will not diminish as a total company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, despite new competition coming in, Telstra in the foreseeable future will be the dominant carrier. For ideological reasons, Senator Alston wants to hand that dominant carrier over to his mates in the private sector, including some foreign owners, to get their hands on the increasing profit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final thing I want to comment on is that in the annual results given last Friday it was said that, in 1996&hyphen;97, Telstra has put aside $1.1 billion for redundancies. This is to help pay off the 22,000 people who will be leaving Telstra. Apparently in one year Telstra will be able to pay that amount of money. It may well reduce its profit for a year but, in the following year, all those people will be off the bottom line. Those people will no longer be a cost; therefore, there will be an extra billion dollars of profit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If that is the outcome the government wants, to reduce the costs in Telstra and to get rid of all of those workers, and there is going to be a big increase in profit accordingly, why can that profit not stay with all Australian people and go into the public revenues to be used in socially useful programs, including retraining programs for Telstra employees?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The motion before us is in regard to the ideological determination to proceed with the sale of one-third of Telstra. `Ideological' may not be quite the right term; perhaps the term should be `bias'. `Ideological' implies that there is a system of ideas and beliefs which someone or some group supports in a committed and integral way, maybe even in a blind and blinkered way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that there is a blind belief in the market&mdash;in this case, the international market&mdash;despite all the work presented by John Kenneth Galbraith and others in the 1970s to indicate that we have long since entered the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3508"> age of mega&hyphen;corporations who are large enough to control markets. An ideological belief in the international communications market guaranteeing efficiency is very hard to swallow. If your definition of efficiency includes consumer outcomes in terms of access and equity, evidence would suggest the contrary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Does the government really believe that public interest and international corporate interests are the same? I do not believe there is any but the most tenuous of real commitments to ideas by this government. Personally, I find them more cynical in support of a pragmatic political approach. We can see this in the way they have linked this bill to short-term support of environmental programs while gutting recurrent funding for the environment. Clearly, this is a fairly crass approach with very little real integrity&mdash;ideological or otherwise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would say that the continued push for the sale is evidence of the power of vested interests rather than ideology. Big business, Murdoch, Microsoft or Intel, would like us to sell Telecom. It is in their interest. And, yes, they have a global influence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clearly not a decision based on economics. The economics show that Telecom is being operated very profitably, thank you. If one believes that efficiency and service delivery translates into profit, then it appears to be operated very efficiently, and that is the opinion of various international operators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, if we have a profitable, efficient company operated by government in a fairly accountable way, where is the economic advantage in selling this company and destroying the income stream? Professor John Quiggin has shown that the income stream is currently more valuable than the value of any debt retirement likely from the sale, even at a lower level of profit and optimistic sale price. So it is not an economic decision.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us clear the air and state that, no matter what the current pretence and protestations, certainly the one-third sale is only a first tranche to total privatisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clearly not a decision based on the public interest. It is not in the interest of the public to lose control of a very profitable <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> enterprise which is also an essential part of the social and economic infrastructure of the country. The likely outcome, as with financial deregulation, is competition. The general outcome of competition is that some company wins, some companies lose and in the struggle public interest becomes expendable. At worst, you end up with a private monopoly. At best, you end up with something like the petrol cartel situation, where a handful of companies get together to set prices once market share is determined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telecommunication is bigger than petrol production. Market entry is more difficult. There are never any `Ma `n Pa' telecommunications companies. They are not local or regional; they are national or, increasingly, global. We are not talking about competition in terms of the village market analogy of Adam Smith; we are talking about the Australian front of the global war between half a dozen competitors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is not just ideological; it is supporting specific interests. It is supporting the interests of global corporations against the interest of the public and against economic self-interest. It is willing to make any deals in whatever way it must in order to serve its corporate masters.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The primary objective driving the privatisation program is to make Australia an efficient, internationally competitive economy&mdash;and that means introducing competition into our enterprises and into our market sector.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TH4">Senator KNOWLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very glad that you asked, Senator Abetz. Those quotes do not come from the Prime Minister of Australia, the Hon. John Howard, or from my honourable colleague here with me today Senator Alston. They are actually quotes from the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley. They are his quotes on the whole issue of privatisation which one could find fairly breathtaking, given what we have just heard from the shadow minister for communications. Labor is now in opposition and opposed to privatisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I want to move on to the important area of employment, because Labor is just as hypocritical in that area. Of course that quote from Mr Beazley did in fact say that `privatisation fits in with the government's broader imperative to create jobs'. So there we have another quote from Mr Beazley about creating jobs, yet right throughout the Telstra inquiry and this debate today we have had both of the opposition parties trying to create an impression that jobs are just going to disappear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Four myths have in fact been perpetuated throughout this debate. One is that the government's partial privatisation policy is responsible for employment reductions in Telstra. Wrong! The second one is that employment reductions must be accompanied by industrial action. That of course will happen only if the Labor Party and the Democrats continue to wind up the unions, who themselves have admitted that job losses are not about the privatisation issue but about technological change. Those are the quotes that are coming directly from the trade unions associated with the Labor Party and associated with the telecommunications industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third myth is that employment throughout the telecommunications industry will disappear. It is clearly not so according to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> those professionals in the telecommunications area who gave evidence to the committee only a couple of months ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth myth is that partial privatisation will reduce employment in regional areas. If that is so, why was it that so many people from country areas gave us evidence to the contrary? Why is it that so many people in country Australia want to see the partial privatisation of Telstra so that they can get more telecommunications services and facilities into rural and regional Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Employment levels in Telstra continue to fall, and will continue to fall for some time, from back when the Labor Party were in government. Let us not forget that the Labor government scrubbed out about 23,000 jobs in Telstra. That is virtually the identical number that we are talking about now. Did they quibble about it? Did they quibble about the jobs in the Commonwealth Bank when they privatised it? Did they quibble about jobs when they were talking about the privatisation of CSL or Qantas? No! The question arises only when they are now in opposition and there is to be partial privatisation of a government instrumentality. Here it is&mdash;and it is different!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Actual staffing numbers are fully determined not by the government but by the Telstra board and management as part of the corporate planning process. Employment levels in Telstra are an outcome of corporate planning&mdash;not of government policy&mdash;and that corporate planning takes into account customer demand; the requirements for capital investment in network development; productivity, including the effects of technological changes; financial performance; investment opportunities; and likely market behaviour by competitors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Technology in particular, as I said before, is reducing employment levels in telecommunications companies around the world. The Queensland Branch Secretary of the CEPU acknowledged, in his evidence before the Senate inquiry, its effect on employment. When asked by Senator Tierney whether those job losses in Telstra are primarily driven by technology, Mr McLean responded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes. The major driver is technology. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3510"> </PARA>
<PARA>The same question was put to another union leader, Mr Colin Cooper, Divisional President of the CEPU, and he responded:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the figures that have been put to us, we have agreed in some areas that there can be staff reductions. We have been through all these processes with new technology.</PARA>
<PARA>To listen to the debate today and what has been said in the months that have preceded it, one would believe that this has come about only because of the whole notion of the partial privatisation of Telstra. The fact is that Telstra remains uncompetitive in a number of areas. If the Labor Party and the Democrats are happy to make sure Telstra remains uncompetitive, they can continue on this frolic that they have been on for some time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They can also continue on the frolic of perpetuating these myths, such as that employment reductions must be accompanied by industrial action. But that will happen only if the Labor Party and the Democrats continue to encourage such industrial action. I was unaware that the Labor Party had encouraged such industrial action when they made privatisation moves when in government. The staff reductions went largely unnoticed by most of the community because they occurred without significant industrial disputation and primarily through voluntary redundancies.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Ah, I am glad you have mentioned that, Senator Carr, because, yes, they are re-employable. Have a look at the evidence that a number of people gave the committee about the employment prospects for people in the industry who might lose their jobs. You are saying that sustainable employment throughout the telecommunications industry will disappear. That is simply not true, and you know it to be not true. Mr Horsley of the Australian Telecommunications Users Group said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me make the point that the industry is desperately short of people. We cannot find them&mdash;we put ads in the paper and our members are looking for people and cannot find them . . . Our experience has been that there is substantial demand for employment and if changes . . . in Telstra result in fewer employees, those employees will pick up work, without a doubt, outside. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>That evidence given to the committee has been totally and utterly neglected by the Labor Party. Mr Perkins of the Service Providers Action Network said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I can sit before you today and say that, in the company and amongst SPAN members, we have a great deal of trouble finding suitably qualified staff. I think that many of the people that will come out of Telstra as a result of this will certainly find employment within the telecommunications industry.</PARA>
<PARA>These people are having difficulty finding staff, yet the Labor Party continues to say that there are no employment opportunities for those who lose their jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth myth, that partial privatisation will reduce employment in regional areas, is just that&mdash;a myth. The spread of sustainable employment opportunities to hybrid telecommunications industries will not stop there. It will affect the entire economy. The telecommunications industry is very important in rural and regional areas. Many industries have shown they are able to grow and develop in rural and regional areas throughout the world, and that could translate here. For example, in the United States large companies have relocated functions such as airline reservations and insurance processing to rural areas where there are lower rental charges. It provides job opportunities at lower costs and with greater housing availability. And those jobs will be picked up. To say otherwise is completely and utterly false.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This debate indicates that, as a result of the decisions that were announced by the Telstra board on Friday, without any doubt Telstra is far too valuable to sell. The proposition we have before us highlights that this government's ideological obsession with the market and with the destruction of this public enterprise is based on one proposition: if it is in the public sector, it is bad; if it is in the private sector, it is good.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3511"> The results on Friday indicate the complete total nonsense that that proposition involves. One of the biggest profits ever in this country was announced: a 31 per cent increase in the profits of Telstra and a return to government of $1.36 billion. It clearly indicates above all that the proposition to sell Telstra is essential ly based on a wrong assumption. There is no empirical evidence to support the conclusion that Australians would be better off, that Telstra would be better off, or that in any way this country would be served, by the proposition that is being advanced by this government. This clearly indicates that the wheels are very much falling off the government's cart in terms of its proposition to privatise Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We see an attempt being made by this government  essentially to kill the goose that lays the golden egg. We are seeing a proposition which, in the most obscene manner, suggests that we put forward $1 billion for redundancy payments, and then use the proceeds of the sale of Telstra to finance an essentially recurrent program for the environment. What an obscenity that is! What an obscenity it is to suggest that, in this era of high unemployment, we can put to our public enterprises that they have no social responsibility and that they should move forward with a program based on headcount figures&mdash;ideological assumptions about the costs of the telecommunications service&mdash;to remove some 22,000 Australians from the employment of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Right across the board, we see people not normally regarded as left&hyphen;wingers, not normal socialists&mdash;people like Alan Kohler, well&hyphen;known for the sorts of policies that he has advanced in support of Jeff Kennett in Victoria&mdash;indicating that a huge Telstra profit sets a few bells ringing. `The Telstra deal is madness,' says Peter Robinson, another well&hyphen;known radical. These are very, very conservative economists. Alan Kohler indicates that it is too good an earner to sell. That is his comment in regard to Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now within the government itself very substantial differences are emerging between Mr Fischer and Senator Alston over what should be done in regard to the dividends received. Laura Tingle has indicated that this is an enormously difficult problem for the government because these massive growths in profits are being announced at the same time as some of the greatest levels of sackings ever known in the history of this country. We are seeing a program of management initiated <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> redundancies as the Telstra Corporation is being carved up, quite contrary to the propositions that were put to the Australian people before the last election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We see even such obscenities as are being proposed by Telstra through their Mercury privatisation task force: that there should be, if necessary, the outsourcing of Australian jobs overseas. We see it quite clearly in the statements made by Mr Blount last Friday night, when he said, `If it is cheaper, we will do it. And if it is the best practice.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Mercury papers show quite clearly that this company is currently engaged in a high&hyphen;level scoping study to remove operator services away from centres in Australia to overseas destinations. So we are concerned about regional jobs, all right&mdash;regional jobs in the Philippines! That is hardly what you would say to be in the best interest of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are noticing again and again that this government's obsession with the market is distorting what is in the national interest and in the social interest of this country. For instance, in regard to project Mercury, an announced program is under way to remove so many jobs from Telstra, which goes far and beyond any possible effect of technological change. We are seeing here a drive to reduce the bottom line in Telstra so the prospectus looks good, and that is being driven by the scoping study, which is being directed by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For this government to stand back and wash their hands of it, to say it is just a management decision, is a complete nonsense. To say that somehow or another the unions have been involved in this is completely nonsense. The quotes that are being used are totally distorted from what was actually said. The union has indicated again and again that we see that technology can be used to reduce the tyranny of distance. It can be used to produce an economic advantage for regional Australia. But that is not how it is being used; it is being used to increase the levels of concentration in centralised locations such as Melbourne and Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just as it can be used to reduce the distances to improve the situation in regional <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3512"> Australia, it is being used to reduce the distances so that overseas companies can penetrate Australian markets in such a way as to reduce employment prospects for Australians. Hence the use of the Philippines as a source for our operator&hyphen;assisted services. When people ring up, they do not necessarily speak to someone in Roma or Burnie. Given the technology that is available, the services can be operated from Manila.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We see the minister saying, `Let us have a look at the world best practice.' And what do we notice in regard to the financial performance of Telstra? The committee report makes it very clear. We see in terms of profit&mdash;the pretax return on capital, return on investment&mdash;that the Australian result is 22 per cent. The world best practice is over 20 per cent, so on that measure Telstra is above world best practice. On interest cover, it is well over world best practice, and on debt ratios, return on average equity and profit margin. It is all detailed in the report. Instead of trying to talk down the achievements of this company, you would expect this government to be talking about what real achievements are being made by Australians and what is one of Australia's and potentially one of the world's great companies. We should also appreciate the contribution it is making to Australian society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister constantly talks about the situation in America for a comparison with overseas companies. But, for instance, Bell Atlantic is a company that serves a market of 19 million lines on the US east coast and enjoys revenue of some $18 billion. During the period from 1992 to 1994, the company cut 1,600 employees from its payroll. As a result, the number of access lines per employee rose 7.6 per cent. Is what we see an improvement in service? No.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The service quality statistics file with the US Federal Communications Commission suggests that these efficiencies have been achieved at a significant cost to the consumer. Between 1992 and 1994, for instance, the company report rate rose sharply. If you look at that in some detail, you see that the situation for consumers has deteriorated markedly. So not only do we see cuts in jobs, cuts to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> regional centres and cuts to the economies of those regions in terms of a multiplier effect, but we see that a loss of service results as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Look at US West&mdash;that great comparison&mdash;which has one of the most notorious employment and customer service records in the United States. That is being used as the great golden model on which we should benchmark Telstra's performance. In 1989, 58,000 employees were engaged in its US operations. By the end of 1993 that number had fallen to 9,000. It is now down to 4,500. A similar experience occurred in New Zealand, where the number of employees has been cut in half. International experience tells us again and again that there will be a loss of jobs, a loss of community service, a loss of customer service. This model is being pursued by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Already, the policies of this government are having a distorting impact on Telstra's operations. It is quite clear that the ideological obsession this government has with privatisation has more to do with its faith in the market and less to do with its commitment to Australian society and the Australian economy.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the brief time available to me, I want to make a few points in response to the arguments we have heard today. I think Senator Alston summed it up best when he said after Senator Kernot's speech that we are still waiting for the arguments. We certainly heard the arguments when we were out holding committee hearings. We heard clear and convincing evidence from experts&mdash;not from amateurs&mdash;that such a change as the part&hyphen;privatisation of Telstra will lead to an easier access to capital, create greater motivation for staff, benefit consumers on costs and services, and improve efficiencies of Telstra to better achieve world best practice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The benefits of privatisation have probably been summed up best by Kim Beazley. Let me quote from his 1994 National Press Club speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Trying to preserve the past&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which is what Senator Carr would like to do&mdash;</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3513">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">may seem to be the best way to protect jobs, but in the longer term it could be a major impediment to achieving a productive future.</PARA>
<PARA>The nub of this debate is the way in which a more efficient Telstra, through the private injection of capital, can improve services and drive down costs. The very flimsy arguments that we have had today, which have centred on the fact that Telstra now has a large profit, miss the whole point of what is happening in the area of telecommunications in this country. In the next year, we are going to be moving to a regime where a number of companies are involved. Already AT&amp;T and Sprint are saddling up to become part of this market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need a much more efficient Telstra. They have made great profits; that is terrific. But by Telstra's own admission, they are 25 per cent off the pace. If they are competing with AT&amp;T and Sprint as well as Optus, they cannot afford to be 25 per cent off the pace. They make great profits, but they also have huge amounts of capital. Only the more efficient operations that will come from a partly privatised Telstra will bring about a situation where we have a great Australian communications company which can not only survive but also compete in the international marketplace. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This debate and how it is voted on will make not the slightest difference as to whether or not one&hyphen;third of Telstra is sold. I have some difficulties with the motion before us; I will mention a couple of them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After Senator Alston made his statement last Monday fortnight, I wrote to him and challenged him as to whether the government were ideologically motivated or whether they just wanted to have the $8 billion. What the proponents of this motion have forgotten, so far as I have heard in this debate thus far, is that the one&hyphen;third sale of Telstra is to obtain $8 billion, $7 billion of which would go to debt redemption. That is something that has got to be thought about as well. I have offered a solution to that&mdash;that we go along the redeemable preference share line. You could have your cake and eat it too. I am not going to go into that because I have not got time. I <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> am not convinced just yet that the government is totally ideologically motivated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard about outstanding performance in respect of profitability and efficiency in public ownership. I hope that is the case. It is yet to be seen in some areas of Australia. No matter what I say here, it will not mean anything. Presumably it is not going to mean anything in future for some of the people who made certain comments today. For example, the mover of this motion, Senator Kernot, asked whether I had made deals with the government. She said she did not know for certain whether I had, but that it was likely.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This motion is not about the principle of trading across issues. This motion is about whether we should privatise one-third of Telstra. Senator Alston's arguments, to me, seem to be summed up as these: we should privatise Telstra because the economic cheer squad says we should; we should privatise Telstra because everybody else is doing it; and, we should privatise Telstra because there is no role for government in a strategic industry like telecommunications. I ask Senator Alston: who is this economic cheer squad? They mostly speak for business&mdash;let's be frank about this&mdash;and some of them have a vested interest in the outcome because of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3514"> their companies' links with Telstra and future pay television scenarios.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the idea that we should do it because everybody else is doing it, the fact that lemming-like we must do what everybody else is fashionably doing these days&mdash;even Cuba and Albania: what about Cuba and Albania? Do we want to emulate their health care systems, for example, Senator Alston or do we just pick off telecommunications in this instance? Privatisation is economic fashion. It does not take account of Australia's demography, geography and history on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the matter of ideology, the ideology that I think underpins the privatisation debate of the coalition government is that, first, the private sector always, no matter what, does everything better. I invite you to look at the recent example of the private sector running of the Olympic Games and the fact that the Sydney Olympic Organising Committee says, `Never again; it didn't work properly.' It is kind of like the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Animal Farm</EMPHASIS> argument: four legs good; two legs bad. This is ideological obsession. The second argument is that the private sector has a greater right to profits and the third ideological argument is that the public sector under no circumstances can be efficient and profitable. This motion seeks to demonstrate otherwise. There is a role for government in strategic industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am asking the Senate to vote for this motion today in order to tell the government to think again; to put Australia's interests first; to congratulate a publicly owned company which is both efficient and profitable and which is doing well on behalf of all the Australians who currently own it. I want to ask this government to stop trying to flog off any of it to any other domestic or foreign owners. I ask all senators to acknowledge that the only argument left is that of blind ideology. They should remember that, on 2 March, 56 per cent of Australians voted for those parties which are opposed to the partial privatisation of Telstra. This government should not claim false mandates.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 12 September, the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government, the Hon. Warwick Smith, and the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, the Hon. Shane Stone, announced the appointment of a new Administrator of the Northern Territory to commence in February of next year. I would like to take this opportunity to comment on the role that has been played by the now retiring administrator, the Hon. Austin Asche AC, who was appointed as Administrator of the Northern Territory on 1 March 1993.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Austin Asche has become a territorian of significant and special note not just because of his appointment, and his tenure and term as administrator, but because of a very distinguished career. Due to a family connection, I am very pleased to be associated with Austin Asche in many respects. My late father, Ern Tambling, was the schoolteacher of Austin Asche in Darwin, Northern Territory, in the 1930s when Austin Asche was there with his family and was then a school student working naturally for my father. Austin Asche has often made the point that my father was one of the people who inspired him with regard to his education and much of his future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly, Austin Asche, in the fields of the law and in education and community service, has stood out as a very eminent Australian. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Austin Asche served for many years at the bar and as a QC. He certainly had a very distinguished career as a judge, both in family law and as Chief Justice of the Northern Territory, for a number of years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have commented on his position as an educator. In fact, he has had the distinguished positions of president of the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology and chancellor of two universities&mdash;Deakin University and the Northern Territory University. He has made contributions in law and education and in far too many community service groups to properly name and do credit to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last few years, in his position as Administrator of the Northern Territory, I can only say that he has done the Northern Territory proud. He has been an administrator who has moved around the entire Northern Territory constantly, hosted hundreds of functions in various capacities, particularly at Government House in Darwin, and who has acted as an emissary for the Northern Territory in other states of Australia, particularly in a number of official visits to Indonesian provinces. He will certainly be missed in the role that he has played.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">His role as administrator has been complemented by that of his wife, Dr Valerie Asche, who for many years worked for the Menzies School of Health Research, also in Darwin. She has also, as a very well qualified person, made a great contribution in the fields of health and community service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that it will be difficult for the administrator designate to replace Austin Asche, but Dr Neil Conn AO, the current Under&hyphen;Treasurer of the Northern Territory, has been appointed. From my personal friendship and professional relationship with him, I know that Dr Neil Conn and Mrs Lesley Conn will make a wonderful couple to replace the Asches at Government House in Darwin.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<TITLE>Condolences: Mr Dunc Gray</TITLE>
<SPEECH PAGE="3516" TIME="5.12 p.m." SPEAKER="Schacht, Sen Chris" NAMEID="4J4" ELECTORATE="SA" PARTY="ALP" GOV="0">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME>
<STATE> (South Australia)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(5.12 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to rise to speak in the adjournment debate to pay tribute to a great Australian who recently passed away, Mr Dunc Gray, who won the gold medal for Australia in cycling in the 1932 Olympic <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3517"> Games. He came from Goulburn, close to this place, and represented Australia at three Olympic Games&mdash;1928, 1932 and 1936. In 1936&mdash;in some senses, the infamous Olympic Games at Berlin&mdash;he was given the honour of leading the Australian team into the arena and carrying the flag.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dunc Gray, in recent years, got considerable publicity&mdash;and quite rightly so&mdash;for being Australia's oldest living gold medal winner. I do not have the actual figures, but I would think there are probably no more than about 50 Australians, in 100 years of Olympic Games, who have won gold medals&mdash;and Dunc Gray was one of them. At the Olympics in Los Angeles in 1932, I think he was one of only two gold medal winners for Australia. I may not have that absolutely correct, but we certainly did not win as many gold medals as we recently won in Atlanta.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dunc Gray, whom I never had the honour to meet, but I did see him on a number of occasions in recent years on television programs and in newspaper articles, struck me as the quintessential Australian sportsperson. Looking at photographs of him as a cyclist in the late 1920s and early 1930s, he was certainly a very handsome and fit young man&mdash;the sort of image I think most of us who were not ever able to be as athletic as he was aspired to in the way we looked and conducted ourselves in an athletic way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also note that in recent times, despite being in his very late 80s, he was always quick and sharp with his comments and still had a great interest in a range of issues. I think he clearly was a great Australian.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was taken by some remarks he made just over two years ago when at a function to promote the Olympic Games. He was at a function with the then Prime Minister, Mr Keating. Before Mr Keating was able to say anything, Dunc Gray expressed a few views that some might find controversial, but I was struck by them. He insisted on expressing these views to everybody at this function&mdash;at which several hundred were present&mdash;as the oldest Olympic gold medallist. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we want to be Australians, we must have our own flag. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>Dunc said that as he reached into his inside pocket and handed out a sketch of his favourite design to Mr Keating. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When I won the gold medal at the 1932 Olympics in Los Angeles, they put the Australian flag up to the masthead and you could only see the Union Jack.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Then they played God Save the King and I wondered who was I riding for.</PARA>
<PARA>In a later interview on Channel 9 he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They presented the medals, they hoisted the flag to the mast and so on. Then they played God Save the King and they had a great big Union Jack on the Australian flag and I thought, `Oh my God,' as I was walking across, `who do I ride for, England or Australia?'</PARA>
<PARA>It is somewhat ironic that four years later he still carried the flag which he made those comments about into the Olympic Games in Berlin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to pay tribute to Dunc Gray for having the courage to express what some people would say would be controversial views. I also think it ought to be noted that as a gold medal winner he is in a very strong position to make a comment which I do not think many of us could in any way disparage even if we disagree with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He has won a gold medal. He has stood on the podium as the flag has been put up on the mast in front of thousands of people at the velodrome in Los Angeles. He has heard <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">God save the King </EMPHASIS>being played, but now that has been changed. Of course, he has marched, holding that flag, into the Berlin Olympic Games.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I do not take his remarks as being in any way critical of, or disloyal to, Australia but as indicating that at the age of 87 he was able to show that he had moved on and still could remember some of what he considered the incongruity of having a symbol that to him was not quite clearly Australian.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that is the real point. Dunc Gray was a quintessential Australian who, even in the 1930s, long before it became a matter of even public controversy, was willing to consider that maybe this country did need to have its own national anthem, which we now have, and ultimately our distinctive flag that is clearly and unambiguously Australian. Irrespective of those controversial remarks, I <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3518"> want to pay tribute to a very great Australian who has done great honour to this country and has been a representative of whom we can all be proud.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>
