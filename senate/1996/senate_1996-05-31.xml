<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Chamarette yesterday asked me a question, by leave, on the Internet. I thank her for giving me notice of that question, and I now respond to it. As senators will recall, the Senate resolved on 28 November 1995 that access to the Internet be provided to senators and members on request from 30 March 1996. On 29 November 1995 the Presiding Officers agreed to a joint proposal from the heads of the parliamentary departments on the respective role and responsibilities of each department in making access available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Planning for senators' and members' access to the Internet is well advanced. The parliamentary departments have made the necessary technical arrangements for connection to the Internet, including identification in principle of an Internet service provider and installation of the fire wall to guard against unauthorised access to the parliamentary network. However, funding for the costs of Internet usage by senators and members has not been finalised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As honourable senators will probably be aware, Mr Speaker and I have been asked by the government to find substantial savings in the next financial year. Unfortunately, it is not possible to make such large reductions without affecting the level of services which can be provided to senators. In this context, there is concern about the possible open-ended nature of the costs and the appropriate source of funding for Internet access.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> I am advised by the Clerk of the Senate that funding the service from running costs is not consistent with the purpose of running costs appropriations nor with current financial stringencies facing the Department of the Senate. The service to be provided in relation to the Internet is in the nature of an entitlement provided under the Parliamentary Entitlements Act, which is similar to other entitle ments such as postage. Legal advice has been received in another context that entitlements under the Parliamentary Entitlements Act do not fall within the terms of running costs. It is preferable that all payments of entitlements under the act be made from special appropriations in the act, not from appropriations under appropriation acts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am further advised by the clerk that the provision of computing equipment to senators in electorate offices is funded by the Department of Administrative Services from special appropriations. The funding of Internet access from Parliament House and electorate offices should be on the same basis, and the establishment of an entitlement under the Parliamentary Entitlements Act is the most appropriate way to proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consultation with the then Minister for Administrative Services was interrupted by the recent election and change of government. The Speaker and I have therefore written to the new Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Jull) seeking his agreement to fund the recurrent cost of the service from special appropriations. In the interim, senators and their staff will continue to have access through the kiosk arrangements in the Senate wing and the Parliamentary Library.</PARA></INTERJECT></PROCTEXT></DEBATE>

<STATE> (Tasmania&mdash;</STATE>
<ROLE>Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate)</ROLE>
<TIME.STAMP>(9.05 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking for the opposition on the supply bills, I would firstly like to make the point that this is a Friday sitting, a special arrangement entered into between the opposition, government and the other parties in the Senate in recognition of the cognisance of time to progress the government's legislation program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When speaking today I will be making a number of points about the general economy, but I certainly will not be taking up my full time in recognition of the need to progress and expedite the government's legislation program. I indicate that is the approach of all of the Labor opposition speakers here today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the face of it the supply bills are routine machinery provisions enabling the business of government to be carried on until the passage of budget appropriations around November. By tradition supply bills provide the opportunity for wide ranging debate in this chamber. I intend to spend some time on a range of economic issues. The supply bills this year have special significance for a couple of reasons. The budget has been put back until August because of the election, and there is no disagreement between the government and the opposition on that. Therefore special provision has to be made for the funding of government until that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, much more fundamentally and importantly this year we have a stark contrast between the pattern and scale of expenditure <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1506"> provided for under these bills based on continuity with the past&mdash;or should I say a discontinuity with the past&mdash;with the approach of the new government. The forthcoming budget bills will apparently present massive expenditure reductions. We do not support the supply bills with our usual enthusiasm this year for the reason I have just mentioned. We strongly believe that continuity with our forward estimates is a proper basis for the 1996&hyphen;97 budget, not the manic slash and burn approach proposed by the new government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These bills provide an opportunity to expose at least some of the arguments that the government has been advancing in attempting to support what we believe is a fundamentally wrong headed, misguided and potentially disastrous budget strategy, not just in its effect on specific groups and constituencies who will be harmed and hurt by the cutbacks, but the whole Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's approach is to argue a legacy of a black hole of an alleged $8 billion which allegedly reflects Labor's mismanagement. It argues that this constitutes a crisis for Australian economic policy. It has to be addressed as the absolute highest priority and any pain involved for particular groups will be outweighed by the wider gain for the Australian community. That is the government's basic premise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today I seek to contest some of those points in my contribution. We do not have a so&hyphen;called Beazley black hole. What we have is a Costello con designed to place blame on Labor for a number of reasons. The first is the Thatcherite small government ideology and the Fightback package which we believed to be dead and buried but which in fact was stored in the bottom drawer ready to be pulled out as soon as the government won the election. The second reason for this approach is the savings that the coalition must make in order to fund its own irresponsible unfunded election promises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue of the $8 billion black hole has rapidly dwindled from the public psyche, certainly from the media's psyche, it seems to me, after talking to a number of financial reporters on Wednesday evening. The issue of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this so-called $8 billion black hole is rapidly fading from sight with the publication of the ABS national account figures, which showed 4.8 per cent economic growth from the March quarter 1995 to the March quarter 1996. Compare that sort of growth rate with that of comparable countries in the OECD&mdash;at a time, I might emphasise, of very low inflation in Australia, in part contributed to by an appreciating Australian dollar, which has helped to keep inflation down, and also contributed to by the accord process. Legacies of this Labor government are: strong economic growth, strong employment growth, very low inflation, significant improvement in productivity, and significant improvement in research and development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even if there was an $8 billion deficit, we would argue that this does not constitute a crisis for the Australian economy or a failure of our economic management but rather is an outcome of our different approach and quite legitimate policy choices. Economic responsibility, from our point of view, demands a different policy approach. It is a policy approach that puts people first. It goes for growth now and in future and adopts a long time frame for addressing the deficit reduction. We acknowledge that that deficit reduction and the related issues that come from that deficit reduction must occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make the point, as we have made it time and time again in debates in this chamber, that the so-called $8 billion black hole is not based on any calculation or accounting of what has happened in the past. It is a projection of what may happen in the future. It is not a blow-out. It is a Treasury official's guess&mdash;and I emphasise the word `guess'&mdash;based on past experience, past record and past economic outcomes about what will happen at some time in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will argue that this $8 billion is an exaggerated figure, rounded up, and a worst case scenario. The headline starting point next year is currently not $7.6 billion but $4.9 billion, and at least $2.3 billion of this is attributable to the negative actions of the coalition, the now government, in blocking a range of our budget measures in the Senate last year. Now the government has gone to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1507"> great lengths to emphasise the opposition's obstruction since the election this year. Nothing could be further from the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To digress slightly, the Telstra bill and the industrial relations bill are off to committees for three months, but they are fundamental reforms of the industrial relations and telecommunications systems. It is not unreasonable that radical reforms should go to committees for three months for a thorough analysis. As I said earlier, we have attempted to progress the government's program by agreeing to exempt bills from the cut&hyphen;off that those opposite imposed on us when we were in government and we have endeavoured not to speak unnecessarily lengthily or repetitively. That stands in strong contrast to the approach of the now government when they were in opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned some of the underlying themes of our approach, while we have been in opposition over the last couple of months, to the fundamental economic issues. There are a range of other points that I would like to comment on today, but I do not intend to do so, in consideration of the time factors that are before us. We want these supply bills passed today. We want to go on to other legislation. There are four or five other bills before us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I conclude I would like to make one other contribution on something I have not touched on in any great detail. It is interesting to note in the contributions by Senator Short and others in speeches here and in question time that they emphasised the issue of savings and occasionally touched on the matter of superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I agree that one of the most fundamental issues we have to face&mdash;it is a fundamental problem; I will argue it is not a legacy of a Labor government&mdash;is this savings issue because without savings we do not have capital for investment. We then have to import capital in order to fund investment and for economic functioning. There is a whole range of issues associated with that. But a number of policy approaches that the government is proposing to take will directly reduce superannuation saving.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In their election promises&mdash;and these may well be further promises they are going to abandon, but I will make a couple of quick points on this superannuation issue&mdash;the government committed to exempting employees earning under $900 a month from paying superannuation. Aside from the fact that the government will benefit because they will not have to ultimately contribute three per cent to those superannuation accounts, we are talking about a million Australians being exempted from superannuation. If you exempt a million Australians from superannuation payments, one of the critical factors is that that inevitably means less people and less money going into superannuation, and that must bring about a reduction in superannuation savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two other areas of change that will affect superannuation saving. One is the introduction of RSAs. By the government's own admission, RSAs will be a low return product. They recognise and accept that that is one of the outcomes. They are also arguing it is a low administration product. I take issue with that argument, but I will comment on that at another time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third approach to superannuation is to allow people to draw on superannuation for housing. Those three issues&mdash;exempting people with earnings less than $900 a month; allowing people to draw on superannuation for housing, and the introduction of RSAs&mdash;will reduce superannuation saving.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I notice that Senator Gibson is in the chamber. I urge Senator Gibson, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, to read a recent publication called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AMP Super Trends</EMPHASIS>. I would urge you to look at the projected policy outcome of your approach to superannuation income with respect to savings. You may have legitimate arguments as to your policy approach in the areas I have mentioned for other reasons, but the effect on savings is very clear. I am not fond of quoting Access Economics, I have to say, but Access Economics make the same point. I do not wish to speak at length on this matter, but I do wish to draw it to the chamber's attention because governments have been very strongly pushing this issue of savings. I share their concern <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1508"> about the savings issue: it is a really fundamental and critical issue for this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion to my contribution to the supply debate, I would like to point out that, on the 4.8 per cent growth in the national account figures, whilst I think for everyone that figure was certainly on the high side, and was surprising, it certainly was not surprising to the opposition that the growth figure was high. Over our 13 years in government we ensured some fundamental reforms to the economy in a range of areas&mdash;micro&hyphen;economic reform, competition policy, waterfront reform, industrial relations reform and the reduction of tariffs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I may say that the reduction in tariffs brought about&mdash;and I will have to double&hyphen;check the figure&mdash;$6 billion in lost revenue to the government as a consequence of tariffs. We hear a lot from the government about increases in revenue as a result of economic growth in the income tax area and the changes we have made to sales tax, capital gains tax, and fringe benefits tax, but we have lost significant revenue from the reductions in the tariff area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to make a point about the strong economic growth that Australia is experiencing. It is amongst the highest in the Western world, with extremely low inflation in comparison to most other countries. The background to this economic growth would have been far better if it had not been for two fundamental problems. Two sectors of the economy in particular have shown a pronounced weakness over the last two years. One is the agricultural sector and the other is finance and insurance. In both these sectors real output has declined at an average annual rate of 1.1 per cent and 0.5 per cent respectively over the past 18 quarters. That is quite a staggering change in those two sectors. That reflects a number of issues. One is the collapse of world wool prices. The second is the recent severe drought in the case of agriculture.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I notice Senator Boswell and Senator McGauran on the other side of the chamber. We all know&mdash;I  certainly know from my travels as a parliamentary secretary into many of these drought areas&mdash;of the terrible effect of drought in the rural sector over the past two years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of the finance and insurance sector, there has been a collapse in asset values over the last two to three years. If you exclude those two sectors from our economic growth rate over the last 4&half; years, our economic growth rate has actually been about half a per cent per annum faster than historic norms. I wanted to make that point because it is not an issue that is debated often. We often debate the outcome of the horrific consequences of the drought and its effect and the collapse in wool prices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite legitimately, Senator Boswell, Senator McGauran and others make the point that these hard times in the rural sector affect us all. It is not just people in rural and regional areas, as I have seen in the last 2&half; years as a parliamentary secretary to Bob Collins and my travels in those areas. The collapse of the rural sector in many areas has dramatically affected the Australian economy. It affects us all.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday, a report from the Commonwealth Ombudsman was released. The report relates to Telstra's conduct in releasing freedom of information documents in an arbitration process between Telstra and Ann Garms, one member of the group called CoT, casualties of Telecom&mdash;or Telstra, as it is now. The report is positively damning of Telstra's behaviour. It reports on what amounted to grossly unfair treatment, foul play and bad faith when it came to supplying claimants with essential information they needed for the arbitration procedure&mdash;information of which only Telstra had possession and which it tried, with every dirty trick in the book, to withhold from its opponents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra is a powerful taxpayer owned body that has used its disproportionate power to thwart, in every possible way, the casualties of Telstra from resolving their long running dispute by means of the `fast track arbitration process'. The Commonwealth Ombudsman's report slams Telstra for its approach in not releasing vital freedom of information material to its opponents in the arbitration process. Telstra has taken actions such as delaying and withholding vital information while at the same time providing it to its own solicitors, interpreting FOI requests so narrowly that it did not have to disclose information on the related telephone exchanges and limiting their interpretation to only information on services to the line; instructing its solicitors to apply exemptions wherever possible and that its solicitors screen for contentious issues, which is against the spirit of the act and against Telstra and government policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to the former minister, as at September last year, Telstra had spent $5.7 <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> million on its complaints system and, directly, $1.2 million just on the arbitration process of four CoT cases. I ask the Senate: how is any Australian able to participate in fair litigation with Telstra when it uses its financial might to crush any attempt by claimants to honour the arbitration agreement, as evidenced by the lengthy and thorough investigation by the Commonwealth Ombudsman?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not only the finding in relation to CoT member Ann Garms, but it is also supported by an earlier investigation into another CoT member, Graham Schorer. CoT members have been experiencing difficulties in Telstra phone services to their businesses for over 10 years. Telstra's behaviour has been the subject of many reports. Austel, the industry regulator, in a report calls Telstra `less than a model corporate citizen'. The Telecommunications Ombudsman said that the arbitration process had reached a new low-water mark in customer relations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In November 1993, Senator Alston and I were told by Telstra that there was no need for a Senate inquiry; it assured us that a fast track non-legalistic process could be set up that would also facilitate access to FOI documents, and that it would be all over by April 1994. After similar assurances from Telstra to CoT members, a fast track settlement proposal was signed by four CoT members in November 1993 in the belief that Telstra was committed to a speedy non-legalistic process that would facilitate access to Telecom documents under FOI.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was actually no less a person than the chairman of Austel who lodged Mrs Garms's FOI application with Telstra in December 1993. To this day, 2&half; years later, Mrs Garms is still being drip fed some documents and still being denied access to exchange documents. Telstra is maintaining to the Ombudsman that arbitration is not an appropriate way for the claimants to obtain FOI information, despite the process underlying both the settlement and arbitration arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The CoT cases did not want to go through arbitration; they much preferred the settlement process. However, Telstra pushed for arbitration. An e-mail between Mr Blount and Steve Black of Telstra obtained under FOI, said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1510">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My course is therefore to force the arbitrator to rule on our preferred rules of arbitration.</PARA>
<PARA>It continued by reading, `We are only remaining in there because to walk away would appear to lead directly to a Senate inquiry.' The CoT members clearly had the understanding that Telstra wanted arbitration or they would not take part at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The CoT members signed up for arbitration because it was guaranteed to be fast track and non-legalistic and that FOI documents would be facilitated under the arbitration process. It is now 2&half; years later. They have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal, technical and accountancy fees to counter the extremely legalistic and technical approach Telstra has forced on the arbitration process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a second tier of casualties of Telstra. One of the members of this second tier received an arbitration determination last week that barely covered the hundreds of thousands of dollars spent in fees. It is Telstra which has made the process so legalistic. Now the Ombudsman has confirmed, in yesterday's report, that Telstra has adopted all sorts of delaying tactics and has withheld vital documents, preventing fair and equal access by the CoT members to the final arbitration process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra not only signed an agreement with the CoT members for a fast-track, non-legalistic process that would deliver FOI documents to the claimants but also promised the now Minister for Communications and the Arts and me that it would be fast track, non-legalistic and would facilitate FOI. The Ombudsman has recommended compensation for the defective administration of Telstra in the processing of the FOI documentation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the issue is far more serious than that. The report details instance after instance of Telstra's actions being directed at frustrating the claimants in the arbitration process. The Ombudsman has said that it is wrong for Telstra to direct that their solicitors identify whether exceptions have been applied `wherever possible' under the FOI act; their record-keeping practice relating to matters which were in dispute was inadequate; it was unreasonable for Telstra to unilaterally scope down the FOI applications so as to not disclose any <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> documents of the relevant Fortitude Valley telephone exchange; and Telstra remained orientated to avoiding disclosure of information, and a change of culture and practice was necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Acting Deputy President Calvert, I am sure you will agree that they are scathing remarks about the behaviour of Telstra. All these findings, and more, are unacceptable for a corporate citizen like Telstra. The open-ended ability of Telstra to finance legal and technical challenges and raise the goalpost so high for small business people, who have in some cases already lost their businesses through lack of telephone services, is totally unacceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The saga for the CoT members has gone on far too long. The long, drawn&hyphen;out dispute, without apparent end, has worn them down emotionally and financially. The delays caused by Telstra, now so clearly documented in the Ombudsman's report, have made a farce of the fast&hyphen;track arbitration process promised to the CoT members and promised to Senator Alston and me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, a means to end Telstra's conduct in relation to FOI documents has to be found. But as the procedure now stands, Telstra has made it so bogged down in legalistic and technical demands that the fast&hyphen;track process has turned into a nightmare and a quagmire for the parties on the other side of Telstra's might. I welcome the Commonwealth Ombudsman's report. I congratulate her office on a thorough and professional report, but this matter cannot continue to lie where it is now.</PARA></SPEECH>

It is about the actual attempt to reduce substantially the funding for the Senate and, indeed, for other parliamentary departments as a whole.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the pieces of legislation we are dealing with at the moment is the Supply (Parliamentary Departments) Bill. I want to indicate to the Senate that we in this parliament have reached a watershed: we are either going to allow the executive government, of whatever colour, to dictate the terms under <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1511"> which we carry out our function; or we stand up as we are required to stand up, as members of parliament, as an institution, for the protection of parliamentary democracy in Australia.</PARA>

In fact, in its forward estimates of 1996-97, the Department of Finance has applied the two per cent reduction to the Senate's running costs base. This results in an estimated provisional running costs reduction of about $918,000. The Senate, in running costs alone, will be a million dollars worse off than we were last year&mdash;a million dollars. I ask the Senate to consider that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an attack on our ability to perform our fundamental tasks as a house of review. We are a house of review and, in order to exercise that function, I believe we are required to examine legislation as it comes from the House of Representatives&mdash;in effect, as it comes from the executive government&mdash;in a manner that does justice to those measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government were to stop and think, it would understand that it is in its best interests&mdash;in the government's best interests&mdash;to ensure that that scrutiny and review is properly undertaken for each and every measure that is presented to us. Why? Because otherwise the system will be run by the bureaucrats. The bureaucrats would be absolutely happy if this chamber was out of the road. It gets in their way. It is a problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, of course, we do not have a dictatorship&mdash;not yet; we have a democracy where people are required to exercise a vote. What do they vote for? They vote for the parliament. Are we going to allow those votes to be despoiled because of an attempt to castrate, to a certain extent, our legitimate activities?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now want to give you the example of the committee system of the Senate. The committee system of this Senate has been operating quite efficiently and effectively over quite a long period of time. The committee system of the Senate enables an in&hyphen;depth review of particular legislation referred to committees. It enables the public to have an input in a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> direct sense into the deliberations of this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Committees are established by this Senate. When references or bills are referred to those committees, very often there is widespread advertising of that fact and a call for submissions from the public, who come to the committees and present their submissions to senators who are members of the particular committee. The members of that committee are then able to ask questions of the submittees about their submissions, about particular aspects of the bill or about particular aspects of the reference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is all part of our representative function. We in this chamber have at least two functions. One function is a representative function; namely, the requirement to express the views of electors in this place, in the committee system and through committee reports. Another function we have is the review function, as I have mentioned before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Very often select committees need to be established. In fact, one select committee met last night for the first time since it was reconstituted after the election. That was the Senate Select Committee on Community Standards Relevant to the Supply of Services Utilising Electronic Technologies, which is dealing with questions about the adequacy of guidelines for film and television programs. It is a very important committee, one which I am sure will attract a considerable amount of attention and one which I am sure will attract a large number of submissions over a period of time. We are sitting only until 31 December and we have to report before that date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of other select committees. In respect of those committees, there was a review undertaken last year by the Senate and the Department of Finance. The review was entitled `Senate Committee Office: Review of Resources' of July 1995. Bear in mind that this was a joint review by the executive, which is represented by the Department of Finance, and by the Department of the Senate. One of the recommendations of that review was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that select committee activity&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, Senate select committee activity&mdash;</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1512">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">over and above that agreed to be catered for in the running costs base by the permanent inclusion of 104 weeks of select committee funding per annum, would be funded in accordance with the agreed profiles in Attachment 1 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Review</EMPHASIS> .</PARA>
<PARA>This was an agreed document. It gave a degree of certainty in respect of one of our functions; that is, the function which is exercised through select committees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has happened? The Department of Finance has unilaterally repudiated that agreement. I believe that&mdash;and I say this through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, to the parliamentary secretary who is dealing with this debate&mdash;should not be countenanced. I believe the executive government should have a very serious look at the repudiation by the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) of that particular agreement. I note that Minister Fahey has not repudiated it, but it is perfectly clear that his department has. I believe that is a matter of grave concern not only for this chamber but also for the executive government. How can any member of parliament have faith or trust in a bureaucracy which unilaterally repudiates such an agreed position?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know we are in a situation of economic stringency. Everybody has to play their part. I believe that this Senate is being asked to play more than its part. What I indicate is that not only has the Department of Finance repudiated the agreement, which was necessary to give some certainty to the operations of the select committee process and the committee processes in this particular Senate, not only has it demanded a two per cent across-the-board reduction in the costs of all departments&mdash;and it is understood by us that something like that needs to be done&mdash;but it is seeking an additional saving of a further $10 million across the parliamentary departments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, Mr Acting Deputy President, I appeal through you to the government to have a good look at that. I think it is in the government's own best interests that this chamber perform its functions of review. I think it is very important because, as I indicated before, if it does not do that, then the place is just run by bureaucrats. I do not want anyone to run away with the idea that I <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> believe all bureaucrats are bad; I do not. There are many thousands of very dedicated public servants in this country, but there are also a few who would like to clip the wings of the parliament and, in so doing, despoil our democracy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a fundamental issue. Although I have examples of what members of the current government said in regard to the Senate when they were in opposition, I do not think quoting those and making this a political issue would assist at all. I hope the parliamentary secretary would take this matter through to the relevant authorities in the executive government in the expectation that we will be able to have the necessary wherewithal to perform properly our functions in the interests not only of good government but also of the people of Australia.</PARA></SPEECH>

<STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(9.50 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The parliament today is cognately debating the supply bills. These are bills which, had we been elected to government, would have come forward in a way similar to the way they have come forward under this government and they are in order to provide sufficient finance for the wheels of government services to continue to turn until such time as the budget can be brought down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new government will obviously put its stamp upon the face of the Australian economy with the new budget. What is happening between now and then is, in essence, where the law has not been changed, a continuity of what we have been doing, and that will continue up until the new budget. So there is support on this side of the house for these bills. Indeed, to contemplate not giving supply would be a serious issue and is one in which we have set out our principal position on the record many times.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the bills we are debating do reflect the outcome of the 1995-96 budget and therefore ought to be viewed from the perspective of a model for what should go forward in the 1996-97 budget. What we are seeing and what I want to address my remarks to today is an artificial crisis that is being created by the government&mdash;not a real crisis; a crisis of confidence, however, in the economy&mdash;and the argument that there needs to be <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1513"> a savage slash of government expenditure, indeed, in my memory, the most ruthlessly savage slash of government expenditure that has been proposed by a government. I do not believe that is true. This is a political argument, not an economic one. In my remarks this morning I wish to expose the hypocrisy of the government's position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I turn to the body of my remarks, I want to acknowledge the address just given to the Senate by Senator Harradine. He touched on a fundamental point and it goes to principles long ago established as enduring and permanent in a modern democracy, and that is the sanctity of the parliamentary process and the separation of that process from the executive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had views not always the same as Senator Harradine on the precise application of those principles, but one area on which I stand square with him, shoulder to shoulder, is that the funding to the parliamentary process should be carved out of a normal appropriation situation so that the government cannot interfere with it and thus undermine the functioning of the parliament and its ability to scrutinise the executive. That ought to be and has to be a fundamental principle and I endorse what Senator Harradine has said about that today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me start the body of my remarks, however, by saying that no-one disputes that a government has the obligation, in the taxpayers' and electors' interest, to run a tight fiscal ship. Flabby government expenditure and inefficient application of government programs are not what governments are put in office to do. They are put in office to ensure that they run a very tight fiscal ship and administer the affairs of state efficiently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make the point that, when we were in government, we did that. We did it not just on the basis of bean counting&mdash;that is, what is the cost&mdash;but also on the basis of quality and equity. It is a question of the quality of services and not just the cost of those services. It is a question of the equitable distribution of the taxpayers' dollar laundered through the government and filtered through its programs that is the important question here. I want to mark the spot where we did <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that; we are not going to retreat from it. Our record is a fine one although we are pilloried and criticised for political purposes. Objectively, when the history of our period of government is written, I think the truth of my remarks will be found to be the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the moment, what we are seeing is not a strategy for a budget; it is not an economic debate. What we are now seeing is a political debate and a political strategy, and the political purpose of the strategy is ideological&mdash;it is to impose in Australia a Thatcherite approach to economic management and a Thatcherite approach for smaller government. Under the cover of the allegation of an $8 billion black hole, this current government is embarking, as I have said, on the most savage slash and burn of the Australian economy that we have seen. Every program is on the block to be cut down and destroyed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once you cut the finances out of these programs to below critical mass you actually bring about their destruction. The purpose is not economic or fiscal rectitude. The purpose is to shrink the size of the public sector so that it performs not the equity balancing role that it should&mdash;helping those in less protected positions in society&mdash;but, rather, an elite role, thus creating the `have' and `have not' structure that we have seen bedevil Britain, and which currently bedevils the US and other countries that do not direct their attention to an equitable social agenda. It is, as I have said, ideological and Thatcherite. No budget strategy would be based on such a flimsy foundation as this one is. It is a flimsy foundation in the sense that an estimate provided in March this year suggested&mdash;I underline the word `estimate'&mdash;what the deficit would be in August, if nothing else changed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the raison d'etre for what is being invited&mdash;what Mr Costello has called the Beazley $8 billion black hole, what the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> earlier this week called the illusory black hole, and what the AAP wire dubbed, on Wednesday, after the national accounts for March were published, the mythical black hole. The government maintains there is a black hole. The media says that this is a joke. The media is right; the government is wrong&mdash;there is not a black <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1514"> hole at all. The allegation of an $8 billion black hole is on an estimate, if no parameter changed between now and the budget. And, of course, those parameters have changed, and changed quite significantly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very important that this point be tied down so that all of those concerned groups in Australian society, worried about the slash and burn approach of this government to the programs and funding that support them, understand that it is built on a fraud. There is no expenditure which can be traced which will lead to this. There is no calculation or accounting to prove this has happened&mdash;no expenditure for a blow&hyphen;out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will come back to the `if nothing changed' scenario, but I also want to say that it is a worst case scenario. The actual figure of the deficit at present is $4.9 billion, and $2.3 billion of that is due to the coalition, who are now the government, knocking back in the last budget bills which would have generated $2.3 billion. So they, too, have played a hand in generating a deficit here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I return to the point. This is a political approach. You would not approach a budget this way. The way in which you would approach a normal budget calculation is to produce a range of figures to show what various estimates would be and continue to update those figures as new information on economic performance comes to hand. You would not base yourself on a worst case scenario. You would base yourself on the probable case scenario, and you would develop that. You would identify a savings ballpark figure. You would then look at where efficiencies and better targeting of measures could save money before you cut the heart out of any programs. You would then identify your own expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government made some extravagant promises during the election campaign. We did not; they did. Part of their own expenditure has to be accommodated here. You would not engage in wholesale cuts. You would start to balance the effectiveness of programs and talk to the portfolio ministers, asking them to produce savings without cutting the heart out of the effectiveness of what they are doing.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That has not been the government approach on this occasion. The government has sought to artificially create a sense of crisis. There is no crisis in the economy. The Australian economy is sound. The most recent evidence we had of that is the phenomenally good growth figure of 4.8 per cent in the national accounts for March published just this week. The pundits argue&mdash;they argued this in the first quarter of the year&mdash;that the economy is expected to perform very strongly in the second half of 1996, and it will.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But if the government gets its way and brings down a horror budget, as it foreshadows, then it will have cut the heart out of public investment in the economy, it will have withdrawn expenditure from the economy and it will bring on a mini recession so that the growth and potential the economy has will not be realised; in fact, it will be reversed. Nonetheless, on current settings, the forecast is for a strong performance in the second half of the year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not a real crisis; it is a politically created cover story to justify an ideological purpose. The cuts foreshadowed across the board do not have to be made in the way in which they are being made. Every sector in Australia will be affected, whether it be the vice&hyphen;chancellors, the higher education people, the people in education, the people in health and community services, the people who provide medical services to Australia, the people in welfare or welfare recipients, or whether it be the people in business and industry who are supported by trade incentives&mdash;across the board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ABC is facing a massive slashing. The National Occupational Health and Safety Commission and Worksafe Australia, which has lowered the level of industrial accidents in Australia, will now be cut; thus, I think, increasing the possibility of a bigger loss of production to industry because accidents will now rise without the supervising responsibility of that agency, and so it goes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1515"> All of those sectors of the Australian community should protest very loudly because what is being worked here is a scam. There are two levels to the scam. One level is the panic and the artificial crisis that the govern ment has created over the $8 billion black hole. The other level is the determination to bring in a budget that does not quite realise the darkest fears that they have excited in the minds of the community so that on budget night there will be a collective sigh of relief. It is like saying, `The house burnt down but at least I saved my furniture and kids.' It is that sort of saving, that sort of relief. The intention then, in engendering that false relief, is to try to get away with saying, `It wasn't as bad as we thought it would be. Therefore, we can live with it.' Nonetheless, you have lost your house at the end of the day. That is the type of scam that is being worked here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My reason for intervening and speaking in this debate today is to point out to all of the pressure groups in Australia that if you do put pressure on this government it will back down. It did back down just this week. We saw on Saturday in New South Wales a number of by-elections. In one seat, Clarence, we saw a swing to Labor of 14.3 per cent and the taking of that seat off the National Party. As soon as that occurred, on Monday evening in a speech to the National Farmers Federation, John Howard, the Prime Minister of Australia, backed away from one of the areas he was going to cut. He said to the NFF that the diesel fuel rebate scheme&mdash;wink, wink; nod, nod&mdash;would be okay. And he said that the other issue the NFF was concerned about, the 150 per cent tax deduction for rural research and development&mdash;wink, wink; nod, nod&mdash;would be okay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That proves that this government will go weak at the knees with political pressure. They are going to retreat a tad from the scare campaign they have put in order to get the electoral bounce they want. The advice I have for every pressure group is: if you don't speak up loudly enough then you will get cut, but if you do speak up loudly enough and put your pressure on the government where it counts then you might succeed, as the National Farmers Federation have done, and have your program saved in some way. I think that is very important. I think it is very important because there is room for savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me just go back to this so-called $8 billion black hole, remembering that that is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> only the case if nothing changes. I will quote Professors John Nevile and Fred Gruen and Mr Fred Argy, who in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 20 May made this point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the figure of $8 billion is itself not a firm figure. It is a Treasury forecast assuming no policy changes and a rate of growth of the economy of 3.25 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>They go on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a small difference in the assumed rate of economic growth can make a large difference in the size of the projected deficit.</PARA>
<PARA>Remember the figure of 3.25 per cent. If nothing changed and we had a rate of economic growth of 3.25 per cent, then maybe the $8 billion would be there. That is the point. The quarterly accounts for March that were published this Tuesday show that the rate of economic growth was 4.8 per cent. That is a level more than one per cent higher than the one that the $8 billion deficit is forecast on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A significant parameter has changed. A significant facility is in the hands of the government not to cut as they have forecast. I again repeat to all of the interested parties out there: if you don't put pressure on them, then you won't get your share of these savings. They do act politically. They did just this week when pressure from the farm lobby centred on them. So get in for your chop or you will get chopped out. That is the bottom line, given the performance of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last few minutes available to me, I will make another point. We are seeing the guts cut out of industry support provisions by this government. We are seeing the dominance in government thinking of a scorched earth, ultra&hyphen;dry economic approach&mdash;a belief that industry in the post&hyphen;protectionist era needs no support at all. That is, of course, not true. Industry, rightly, has pointed out that it is not true.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not support&mdash;I never did and as a former industry minister would not anyway&mdash;a handout mentality. The government I was a part of conducted a major restructuring of the Australian economy and wound back tariffs and integrated the Australian economy into the economy of the world.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1516">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a post&hyphen;protectionist economy in Australia there is a very important role for industry policy. That is not a handout policy and a protective policy, but it is a policy of providing at the export end international market intelligence through Austrade so that Australian business can see into every other market in the world and identify opportunity for itself. It is a policy of providing some support for Australian business people to venture into those markets and win contracts. The export market development scheme, the DIFF scheme and the ITA scheme are there for that purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a policy, too, where people have initiative and are making a play to grow their companies, of providing through the NIE scheme to help them do so. It is a policy that provides incentives for research and development. It is a policy that particularly helps small to medium sized enterprises be across those things that they do not have an economy of scale to do in-house, that can be provided as a service to the sector so that those with initiative&mdash;this is not picking winners; this is backing winners&mdash;can be supported to achieve. If they do achieve, they create jobs in Australia, they grow the Australian economy and they turn the current account deficit around.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To cut out in one fell swoop, as this government is proposing, all of those programs which support and back that initiative is to in fact cut out the job creation that growth in the business sector will create, to in fact turn the current account deficit back on itself and blow that out. It is a wrong headed, ultra&hyphen;dry, Thatcherite policy that has no place in post&hyphen;protectionist Australia. If this government goes go down that road, it will be dudding Australian industry and Australian workers who are looking for employment in the future. It is as simple as that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My final concern is a scientific issue. The astronomy community is concerned about the withdrawal of negotiations with the European Southern Observatory. As a former science minister, I asked the department to negotiate a role for Australia in the construction and operation of that telescope. It is important that astronomers in Australia&mdash;a major sector of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> our science achievement in this country&mdash;have access to that operation and that there be a longer term vision for astronomy. In the election campaign the present government promised to support them. It is now saying, `Withdraw from the negotiations, you can't proceed.' That is going back on a firm and sober election undertaking, and it should not have occurred. The fact that it has occurred is a travesty, and the government should reverse its position. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to Supply (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1996, Supply Bill (No. 1) 1996-97 and Supply Bill (No. 2) 1996-97, which are being dealt with together, I want to try to put some context into the debate. Australia is a low tax country. When we compare Australia to OECD countries, we find that Australia does not require individuals to pay a large portion of their income in tax. Australians most certainly pay more tax than people in countries with no social security. Australians most certainly pay more tax than people in countries with governments which do not believe they have a role to look after equity and access in education and in health, or to provide some guarantee that people will not starve in the streets. So, in effect, Australia is a small government country. Therefore, why is there evidence of a strong ideological agenda to push for smaller government and smaller tax?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let's face it, there are always two sides to any government spending agenda. You work out what funds you are going to need for the programs you want, and you work out how you are going to fund them. There seems to be an overall emphasis on cutting back on the amount of tax paid by people and businesses in Australian society, and therefore we get an overemphasis on cutting back the programs. We do not seem to have an emphasis on the questions: what are we trying to achieve as a country; and, what do we think the role of government is?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a different opinion than the government has. The Greens stand for four principles: environmental sustainability, peace and disarmament, social justice, and participatory democracy. My belief is that governments <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1517"> have an a very important role to see that there is a distributive justice in the availability of such things as health and education, and even the ability to have a decent, safe transport system. We seem to have an almost unstated assumption that, for example, our transport system&mdash;our rail transport system, air systems, airlines and shipping&mdash;must be run not only by private enterprise but also by very large international conglomerates. I am not sure where this comes into logic. The irony is that in recent times we have heard a lot said about political correctness, when perhaps we should be talking more about economic correctness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we hear as the norm now from many commentators when talking about not just the economy but how the social system should run is what was a recognised ideological stance back in 1980s. It was then called monetarism and was the work of Milton Freidman. There were certain assumptions associated with that ideology. It was said the market was the answer to all our problems. It was claimed that you could go to a school or university using a voucher system and that that was your a choice, but it forgot to mention that you had a choice to starve. It said you had the right not to pay many taxes, but it also said that you had the right to go to a poor house if you did not fit into the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Basically, what was recognised as an ideological economic choice in the 1980s has suddenly become economic correctness. Anybody who speaks differently to that and talks about a value system that does not fit the economic correctness mode is now considered to be a radical. The changes that have occurred in the last few years are probably some of the most radical that this country has ever seen&mdash;for example, the changes that have resulted from globalism and internationalism and the changes that have resulted from the assumption that everything that government must do must conform somehow to competition policy and if it does not there has to be a specific exception made for it in legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot see that this place is going to make exceptions in all of the areas where we thought there was some value, apart from the short&hyphen;term dollar. I am very afraid for this country. I am very afraid about what is going <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to happen by 1998 when the competition time bomb explodes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last few days, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) has been using the current account figures to justify slashing the budget further. It seems that he has conveniently ignored the demise of the twin deficit theory&mdash;that is, that there is no provable connection between the budget and the current account. Certainly you cannot guarantee to improve your current account by further slashing and burning and yet this is what is coming from the Treasurer. He is ignoring completely that in 1993 we signed the Uruguay Round of GATT. He is ignoring people like the Greens who, in 1993, said, `Look at the trade deficit in a year or two years time.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have a look at what the current account deficit will be once the government takes the very large steps&mdash;those steps which were not actually required under the rules of the World Trade Organisation but which Australia chose to take to pretend to be pure and so that the rest of world would follow&mdash;it intends to take. How naive!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Surprise, surprise! Here we are in 1996 with a growing current account deficit and a growing trade blow&hyphen;out, which, funnily enough, started just after the decision to join the World Trade Organisation. From then on the deficit increased by $1 billion or $2 billion a month. Before that we had, almost from time immemorial, a trade surplus. What a surprise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How on earth do you think we are going to improve the trade surplus by slashing our budget in Australia further? There might be some slight changes, but it might go in other direction. Instead of admitting that our trade regime&mdash;our tariff regime and our industry policy&mdash;is having a major effect on our balance of trade and our trade figures, we are pretending it only has something to do with the amount we have to slash and burn on government departments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While speaking about slashing and burning on government departments, I will say that the Greens did give notice to the government that during the committee stage of this bill we will be asking questions about these bills, about the measures in these bills. So far I <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1518"> have largely seen one adviser from the government. I hope the rest are listening in because I expect sufficient people will participate in this debate during the committee stage and ask questions about the nature of these bills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is only reasonable to expect that the answers will be provided in the committee stage. Therefore, if answers are not provided perhaps we will need to adjourn the debate until the answers are available. But I would expect that, having given notice that we would like to ask questions about what is in these bills, you would provide the people to answer the questions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The doctrine of economic correctness has been criticised by people such as Robert Fitzgerald from ACOSS. The frightening thing is that it is simply no longer an economic doctrine. If you think about economic correctness as it is now writ, it now permeates every public sector. It permeates education; it permeates health; it permeates women's issues and Aboriginal issues; it permeates communication; it permeates industrial relations. It permeates every section.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Economic correctness not only is the short&hyphen;term dollar profitability of major corporations&mdash;now considered to be the major driving force of the economy&mdash;but it is now the major driving force of how we make decisions on the rest of our society; never mind that the outcome of this level of competition policy actually means that we may well be destroying community, that the casualties of this system may end up costing government a great deal more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, the system looks at what areas appear to be superfluous. Those kinds of areas are community support mechanisms. Funnily enough, very shortly down the track you will find that if you pull out the community support mechanisms the cost does not decrease. The most effective, most efficient ways to provide support in our community are through community support mechanisms. Once you pull those out and community starts to erode and be destroyed, the costs of rampant individualism soar. The costs of alienation, the costs of people falling out of system and falling along the way, become greater. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> There are the human costs, the environmental costs and the social costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That leads me to the question: what is radical and what is commonsense? The question the Greens have been asking, certainly since I have been talking on Green economic issues since 1993, is: what are the outcomes of the changes that have been made so far and what are the prospective outcomes of the changes that you are proposing from now on? That is not a radical question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the kind of question the Australian Consumers Association is asking, and that is not radical either. It says if you want a new trade regime, if you have a new trade regime, if you have signed onto the Uruguay Round of GATT, let us find out what the implications are. What are the environmental implications? What are the social implications? What are the employment and other economic implications? I have not seen any report that actually indicates that the government has made the effort to find out what they are. Yet we are prepared to jump not only into the Uruguay Round of GATT but also into APEC without even assessing what we have done so far.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at what the implications are of competition policy. What are the impacts on the people you are serving? What are the impacts on the level of youth health? What are the impacts on the quality of education? What are the impacts on communities able to service their needs? What are the impacts on women? What are the impacts on Aboriginal people? What are the impacts on the environment when during competition policy you say that the most important thing is the dollar, and the short&hyphen;term dollar at that? We are not even prepared to look at the long-term implications of destroying our natural capital in the meantime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are not radical questions; these are basic questions. If you are operating a basic business and making a policy change, you would check out what the implications were of making those decisions. I am very afraid for the policy direction of Australia because we have not asked those questions and I have seen no indication that we have made any attempt to look at the answers. The policy <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1519"> outcomes remain to be seen in terms of real outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In concluding my speech I have a number of questions I would like to ask during the committee stage about the decisions that have been made which are indicated in the bills before us. I will be expecting that there will be the ability to find answers to those questions.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate for this opportunity to briefly raise a matter that is of some concern to me in relation to these bills, even though I was not originally on the list of speakers. I thank senators for their indulgence. I do not rise to oppose any of the bills but to raise a particular matter which is of concern to me and to women generally in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am referring to the funding for the Office of the Status of Women and the national agenda for women. It has been foreshadowed that there will be budget cuts to the Office of the Status of Women which will bring about a 46 per cent  reduction in the staffing levels of that department. These cuts will also affect the national agenda for women and all those volunteer women's groups funded in some small way through that program. There is every indication that those cuts will be extraordinarily bloodthirsty in their effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of these groups have met with the responsible minister, Senator Newman, as was indicated yesterday, but these groups have not been provided with any sort of reassurance or assistance whatsoever. In fact, they have been given the cold shoulder by the new Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women (Senator Newman).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These bills before the Senate today allow for the funding of the business of government until the budget appropriation bills can go through. This interim funding that is meant to carry us through from 30 June until the budget is not applied to every government program and certainly not applied to every organisation funded by government. The groups which have been clearly excluded from this process of continuing funding are those funded through the women's agenda and the Office of the Status of Women.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is often argued that the funding of these sorts of groups is really of little significance to mainstream women because they might be branded as radical feminists or some sort of fringe group which really does not have a direct effect on women in the community generally. I state very strongly that that is not the case. These are groups which, through extraordinarily small amounts of funds provided by the government and an extraordinarily large amount of voluntary labour from women all over Australia, continue work that is very beneficial for the community at large and certainly very much appreciated by women individually.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will mention a few of the groups that will have their funding cut. They have been told that as of 30 June there will be no more funds; that at some time&mdash;possibly in the budget&mdash;they might receive some funding, but at this stage it is completely uncertain. A voluntary organisation that really relies on a small amount of funding for the rent of an office or to employ a couple of part&hyphen;time staff cannot suddenly find funding to carry it through for two or three months. Essentially it means that those offices and organisations will close down and that will be a very sad thing in my view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the organisations which might not be characterised as mainstream. They are the Association of Women Educators; Australian Women in Agriculture; CAPOW, the Coalition of Participating Organisations of Women; the Foundation for Australian Agricultural Women; the Nursing Mothers Association of Australia; the Older Women's Network of Australia; the Refugee Women's Network; Women With Disabilities Australia; the Women's Electoral Lobby; Womensport Australia and the Young Women's Christian Association of Australia. There are a number of others that I will not mention, but that is a sample to show the mainstream nature of these women's groups and the contribution that they make to the community at large.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been very lucky to have been involved with the Older Women's Network at Gosford. From time to time they have invited me along. It is a gathering point for women, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1520"> particularly women of retirement age, for swapping information and taking in new ideas from outside. It has been an extraordinarily useful organisation and very much appreciated by that community. In fact, about 25 per cent of people in the Central Coast seat of Robertson are over 50. Not only does it provide a service for the women in the community, but the Older Women's Network also, through a very small amount of federal government funding, has been able to provide an extremely useful service to the government. For the last 12 months it has been collecting information on the topic of menopause, about which not a great deal has been done to date, particularly on the social aspects, apart from the medical side.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to put on the record today my deep concern, and the concern of a number of groups who have raised the matter with me, that these groups have not been provided with funding up until the budget through resourcing appropriated in these supply bills, and I hope that the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women, Senator Newman, may reconsider and allow the very useful organisation of services provided by that funding to continue.</PARA></SPEECH>

I asked him, as if I wouldn't know, whether the drought affects the economy. Without doubt, it affects the economy. There is no doubt about that. I am a farmer; I know what it is like to go through a drought. I know how it can affect the economy. In 1982 the eastern states had a massive drought and in 1983 Western Australia had a massive drought. Hopefully, it will not be repeated too often. Former Senator Button and Mr Keating would not have a bar of the fact that that is what affected Mr Fraser's last budget. When I first came here in 1987, former Senator Button&mdash;</PARA>

You claim it now, but you would not admit it in 1982.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have listened rather intently to a few of the first speeches in this place over the last few weeks. I was very impressed with Senator Conroy's speech, and I congratulate him on it. I did not hear Senator Lundy's speech, so I will have to wait until I read her speech to comment. Senator Mackay, from Tasmania, belaboured the economic plight of Tasmania, as did Senator Murphy yesterday.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I can give the Tasmanians a bit of advice&mdash;my great friend and colleague Senator Calvert is a Tasmanian, as is Senator Gibson&mdash;the rot started in Tasmania in 1983. It started when the Labor government knocked progress out, when it stopped the Franklin River dam. All Senator Sherry has done down in Tasmania is knock the hotel industry around&mdash;but we will not go into that. Maybe it was not the stopping of the Franklin River dam on its own that began the rot, but the rot certainly did start when we let the radical groups take over Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Western Australia we took a different approach. When we got rid of the Labor governments of the late fifties, the early sixties and over a very short period in the seventies, under Sir Charles Court Western Australia started moving. You did not do that in Tasmania, and now you have to accept your fate. If you have any resource industries, you have to get them going and get Tasmania out of the mire. That is my advice to you, speaking as a Western Australian and taking a Western Australian attitude towards resource development.</PARA>

I think he has hit a point of validity that needs to be addressed by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate is being subjected to abuse and vilification for doing its job. Subjecting legislation to scrutiny is called obstruction and delay. Voting against bills and parts of bills is called obstruction. Having an opinion, a vote, is called obstruction. Engaging in the committee process is challenged and delayed by the failure to nominate members and by the cuts in funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When these sorts of things happened under the previous government, the coalition spoke out strongly against it and recognised it for what it was&mdash;executive arrogance. That is what we are seeing at play at the moment. Unfortunately, we are in that exact time warp where the Labor Party&mdash;which was pretty good at demonstrating that kind of executive arrogance and impatience with the Senate for doing its job&mdash;has not yet developed fully in its opposition role or reawakened its conscience and its view about the role of democracy in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we are in that very dangerous crossover period where the government, mainly the executive&mdash;I would not say the government as a whole; I will come to that in a minute&mdash;is leaping forward, running ahead of democracy, and the opposition has not yet awoken to its full role in challenging that and in doing its job for the people of Australia and in the public interest.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1523">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The community values and requires good government, but it does so in the context of a parliamentary democracy. I could not agree more with Senator Harradine that parliamentary democracy is under threat. The debate we are having in the chamber today is an example of that. What is under threat is not only the proper functioning and performing of the Senate as a result of funding cuts&mdash;I have fears that it is much wider than that&mdash;but also the government of this country and the public good. What we have been observing over the past few weeks has disturbed me and, I suspect, other colleagues. It is certainly deeply troubling to a wide ranging cross-section of the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The words `Jobs, jobs, jobs' used to be the cry. It used to be the slogan of both government and opposition. Whenever the issue of the protection of the environment&mdash;the devastation of woodchipping of high conservation value or old growth native forest&mdash;was raised, the question was, `But what about the jobs that will be lost in the timber industry? What about jobs that will be lost in the communities that are dependent on woodchipping?' Whenever a mining proposal was being superimposed on a fragile environment or Aboriginal land, people said, `Jobs, jobs, jobs will be created by this mining development. Don't worry about the environment. Don't worry about the Aboriginal community. They'll like a job or two here and there, and we'll be able to go forward.' Whenever a development by a multinational is being queried as utterly inappropriate to the social and environmental needs of a local community on our coasts in Western Australia, people say, `Ah, but this will bring jobs, jobs, jobs, and therefore it is justified.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where is the cry `Jobs, jobs, jobs' now? I will tell you: it has become the answer to the question `How are we going to cut expenditure?' The answer is, `Jobs, jobs, jobs. Let's cut expenditure by cutting down on jobs right throughout every sector in this community.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Look at the complaints that we are receiving from almost every sector. I will raise some of those complaints in relation to expenditure on women's grants programs, environmental grants and Aboriginal and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Torres Strait Islander community grants. There is a vast range of concerns. My colleague Senator Margetts will raise them in various sectors, such as the health sector and the education sector&mdash;in all the sectors of our community where we are really under threat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is definitely an ideologically driven strategy behind government. I believe that Senator Panizza's speech, which immediately preceded mine, is a wonderful illustration of this. Suddenly the jobs and the people in the community who suffer from the social impact of these ideologically driven expenditure cuts are of no relevance whatsoever. The pain in this community is great; the fear and the threat are there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that the performance of the ministers who answer our questions in question time in the Senate is extremely disappointing. What we see is role&hyphen;playing and posturing. They are clearly not fully across their portfolios. Maybe we should be charitable: give them time, give them a break and let them learn the ropes. I see Senator Gibson nodding and wanting a bit of sympathy in that regard. If that was all, I would give you sympathy, Senator Gibson, and I would give your ministers sympathy. I have great sympathy for them. However, I believe it is much deeper and more sinister than that. I think they are learning to play the roles we observed being played by ministers of the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not really that which is perturbing. We can forgive a bit of lapse or not understanding the procedures when you are first in government. Heaven knows that the former government was pretty poor in opposition in the first week. The WA Greens, because we are continually in the role of opposition, have not had as much difficulty with the transition. It is not that transition I am worried about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I believe is deeper and sinister is that the ministers in this place do not actually have any say in the decisions that are being made in regard to their portfolios. They do not have any say in the expenditure cuts that are taking place. That is what is perturbing. I do not intend to ridicule them for having difficulty coming to grips with their portfolio, but I am deeply perturbed that they are <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1524"> having difficulty coming to grips with their portfolio because they do not have any decision-making power as to what is happening. Their role is simply to fudge and cover up what is occurring at this time&mdash;not when the budget occurs, but right now&mdash;in departments and programs right throughout this country.

That is why these matters need to be debated in this place. That is why, when the Senate's functioning is being undermined, democracy is being undermined in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we should send Senator Parer to the hazardous waste conventions. I would like to send whomever it is who is supporting him in his role of letting uranium mining have such an open slather. It is not appropriate that we see this ideological shift which says that balancing the books will make us prosperous and we will deal with all these other problems. We are actually creating problems. We are creating environmental problems and we are creating enormous economic problems within our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Balancing the books and becoming prosperous will not create jobs; it will create an enormous inequity, a disparity, between the rich and the poor. This disparity has already been increasing at far too marked a pace. We are really selling out certain sections of the community against others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is committed to cutting expenditure and is opposed to revenue raising, but with some notable exceptions. It says, `We will not raise revenue to meet our social justice agenda to improve health, education and welfare.' It is ruthlessly cutting back everywhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander funding is the first target. The government says, `There is a waste of money there'. I assure you that any money that has been wasted in ATSIC is nothing on what has been wasted in defence and in government portfolios. The government says, `Migrants&mdash;there is an easy place to cut.' I quote from a document that was tabled in the Senate:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1525">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Social Security requires migrants to wait two years for benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Description of measure: achieve savings&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and I stress `achieve savings'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">by requiring new arrivals in Australia to wait two years before they are able to receive benefits.</PARA>
<PARA>Thank you very much.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Look at the double orphan benefit. When newly arrived migrant parents are wiped out, the children are left as double orphans and cannot get any funding because it is within the two-year period. But this will achieve savings. It is a disgrace. It is an utter disgrace that we are prepared to cut expenditure in this way by reducing programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It may be said, the government has ruthlessly cut back, but it says, `We do protect some people, Senator Chamarette. You have got it out of balance. We protect some people. Defence is being protected.' Of course, Defence is being protected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will not raise the Medicare levy for the improvement of health facilities, such as public hospital services, within this country, but suddenly we have passed an exemption motion in respect of this bill, which I have supported, to raise the Medicare levy. What are we raising it for? We are raising it to pay compensation to gun owners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So this ideological position is very selective. It is protecting certain vested interests and it is exposing the vast public interest to a great danger. I would be very glad to see the legitimate compensation measures, and I thank Senator Margetts for reminding me that there are a few other people that it protects as well. I am wrong to say that it is totally selective in terms of protecting defence and industry and mining companies and gun owners for their legitimate compensation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not disagree that it is legitimate compensation, but why do we have the political will to provide the gun owners with compensation for their guns, yet we will not provide money for the legitimate compensation of Aboriginal people for stealing their land 200 years ago? We will not even look at it. In fact, what we want to do is wipe out native title. Fortunately, we cannot just rub it out. It exists. We want to wipe it out so that we do <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not have to compensate. If you can give away your Crown land, if you can give it to development programs and make it into freehold, you do not have to compensate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Margetts carefully pointed out to me, the Olympics are also being protected. That is good, isn't it? Not everybody is being ruthlessly cut. The Olympics and the defence budgets are being protected. Great! I am not very impressed by this, as you can probably tell, and I think I had better wind down a little bit so that I can conclude with what is of relevance to the debate today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Basically, what we see, as I have said, is that a small clique of members of this government, along with like-minded vested interests within the community, seem to be running the show. The purpose of putting the supply bills through this place is to allow us scrutiny and a voice on expenditure on programs. Is the government doing its job?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Margetts indicated, at the committee stage the Greens will be inquiring into the existing programs, the matters within this bill. It is the appropriate accountability mechanism. There would normally have been estimates committees, which would have allowed us to have these proper accountability and scrutiny processes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition has always taken that responsibility very seriously, and the Greens (WA) intend to take that responsibility very seriously too in the only opportunity available to us in this chamber; that is, in the Committee of the Whole. We will be looking at the programs. I am not saying we are not interested in what the budget will be, but we recognise that it is inappropriate to ask questions about the budget. We are not going to ask questions about the budget. We are going to ask questions about what will happen between now and the budget. In what way do the supply bills actually put into place and implement the cutting mechanisms that this ideologically driven government seems to be bent on heading towards?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I close by indicating that we will be raising some of the matters about existing programs and what is going to happen to them after 30 June. It is most appropriate and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1526"> it will occur, and I value the opportunity of this debate in which to raise those issues.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These supply bills cover the government expenditure for the five months from 1 July 1996 until whenever we get around to passing the appropriation bills. In the lead&hyphen;up to the budget process we, on the government side, have had to look at ways of somehow dealing with the $8 billion black hole that 13 years of Labor mismanagement has left for Australia and Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of us have to play some part in the belt-tightening that needs to be done. I heard Senator Harradine and just recently Senator Chamarette complaining about the cutback to costs in the chambers of the parliament. I am not sure what is going to happen there. The budget bills have not been brought down, but there have been some suggestions about it. Senator Harradine was saying that we need full funding here so that this chamber can perform its role in making sure that bureaucrats do not run the place. I agree with that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to Senator Harradine and the Greens that, if we are continually frustrated by the opposition parties in a way that has never occurred in the past in getting on with government business, that practice can interrupt the processes of this chamber. I heard Senator Chamarette talking about the undermining of democracy. Senator Chamarette, democracy means following the will of the people. Not even you can deny the enormous mandate that John Howard's government got at the last election&mdash;a mandate not only in the House of Representatives but also in the Senate. You count the figures. You do not like hearing about this, so you will leave.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you talk about democracy, you talk about the will of the people. If you people had any real commitment to democracy, you would allow this government to get on with its program and implement the will of the people. It is absolutely ludicrous in relation to the Telstra bill. Senator Kernot, the Democrats leader, says that she has a mandate. I am not sure what the mandate is for. If you add up the Senate votes for the Queensland Liberal and National Party candidates and then add up the combined votes for Labor, the Greens and the Democrats, you will find that the figure for the combined votes does not come anywhere near the vote that we got. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1527"> You talk about democracy. Have a look at the figures and see where your democratic principles are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I almost choked when Senator Cook started talking about the sanctity of this chamber. Senator Cook&mdash;a member of the party that called this chamber unrepresentative swill; a member of the party which has pledged to get rid of the Senate&mdash;went on with the hypocritical statements about the sanctity of this chamber. I almost choked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party, in their scare campaign in the run&hyphen;up to the budget process, have been telling the higher education people that there will be massive cuts. They have been telling various groups that there will be massive cutbacks in social security. None of this has yet been decided. You will see what it is all about when the budget comes down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to raise very briefly in this address the way to overcome some of the foreseen problems in the budget process. I really think that we do again have to start debating a proper and sensible indirect taxation system, a proper and sensible consumption tax for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was recently at a conference overseas and I talked to some parliamentarians from New Zealand. They said to me that they continue to be surprised at the amount of revenue they are collecting from their GST&mdash;money that they did not know was there; money from the black economy, the sort of economy the Labor Party protected in the 1993 election. That sort of taxation system would do more towards building up funds for social security, for people in our society less fortunate, if we could get our hands on those people in the black economy who are not paying tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand what Mr Howard said last Friday. He said that we would not be having a GST, and I accept that, because Mr Howard is an honourable man. As he had committed himself in the election campaign to not having a GST, then we would not have it. What Mr Howard meant was that we would not be having the sort of GST that the Labor Party told lies about last time&mdash;the 15 per cent on everything GST. That is what the Australian people voted against&mdash;15 per cent on top of everything that you are paying now. That is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> what the people voted against. They did not vote against a proper and sensible consumption tax. I think, in this country at the moment, we have to start debating a better way of doing things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We really need to tax spending, not earnings, because once you tax earnings you tax people who want to work, you tax people who are trying to do something for the country and you tax the sort of people who are getting in and making Australia work, and that sends all the wrong sorts of signals. You should be encouraging Australians to work harder and better, to produce more, for better living standards for all of us and, particularly, so that we can look after those people who are not as fortunate as us and cannot look after themselves. There really needs to be more tax on spending and less tax on earnings to give us the opportunity of looking after those who are not able to look after themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need an indirect tax system that, when imposed, is rebated at every stage of the production process. That is the sort of indirect consumption tax we need&mdash;not, as at present,  where all of those sales taxes go all the way through the system of production and stay there to the very end. The present system means that the cost of doing business in Australia, the cost of producing things, particularly the cost of our exports, is higher than it should be, and it makes us less competitive overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we need is a system where, as those taxes go on, they are rebated at every stage of the process so that the tax is eventually applied once and for all on the end consumer only. If the end consumer is an export buyer, then the tax is not applied at all. That means that our exports are cheaper, we sell more, we therefore have to produce more and we create jobs and wealth for Australians so that we can look after the people that you say you are interested in, Senator Margetts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tell me, Senator Margetts, why do we have an indirect tax on goods but not on the services that the wealthier elements of society tend to use&mdash;services like those provided by accountants, lawyers, architects, interior decorators and landscape gardeners&mdash;which are <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1528"> all exempt from tax? Have a look at cars, bread, milk, and all those sorts of things. That lot, the ALP, put a tax on them. They are the things that the lower income people in Australia have to use. They are taxed, but the services that tend to be used by the higher income earners in our society are let go scot&hyphen;free. You have heard the stories about some of our wealthiest people not paying any tax at all. At least, with a proper and sensible consumption tax, those people would start paying their way. That needs to be done. Why is the tax only on goods and why will you not have a sensible tax on services?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need a tax system where taxes on goods are subject to cash rebates or income tax concessions for the lower income elements of our society on whom they impact. That is essential and needs to be done. In proposals that have been thrown around, that was considered and implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am always concerned about the impact that the current system of taxation has on regional Australia, and particularly on the cost of transport, because, if you live in regional Australia&mdash;if you happen to be one of those who are not quite fortunate enough to live in the golden triangle of Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra&mdash;you pay extra for everything because of the indirect cost on the means of transport, principally fuel, at the rate of 35c a litre. Everything we use in the north and west&mdash;everywhere&mdash;in some way has that element of that 35c a litre. It applies across the board. It is terribly unfair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cost of transport adds to the cost of producing things in regional Australia, and this is terribly unfair because most of our wealth comes from regional Australia. Most of our wealth is from agriculture and mining, which is all done in regional Australia. These indirect costs are always there and make the cost of our exports much higher.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not appeal to the Democrats leader&mdash;some of her colleagues are having second thoughts&mdash;but I do appeal to Labor and the Greens. If they had any interest in Australia at all, they would do two things. First of all, they would stop frustrating this government, which democratically received a mandate to do certain things. They would allow this chamber and the government to get on with </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA>the business for which it was elected. Secondly, they would allow a bipartisan and proper debate on a proper form of indirect taxation. It does not have to be called a GST. It may not, in any way, follow the GST proposals. Perhaps we should call it a beneficial indirect tax on goods and services&mdash;the acronym for which is a BIT O' GAS. Perhaps if we did something like that we would give Australians a bit of gas, a bit of a oomph, a bit of rocket fuel, to get Australia going again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we have to start the debate. It does not have to be done this year or even next year, but we do have to start the debate on a proper and sensible form of indirect tax. If we can do that, we will create more wealth for Australia and Australia would then be in a better position to look after all those people that we, in a modern, progressive and liberal nation, need to be able to look after.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the supply bills. I do not want to extend this very long, so I will not be speaking for very long. What I want to say is something that has to be put on the record before we have a look at supply and before we vote on it. It is something we should all keep in mind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senators will probably know that there was a joint review of Senate committee funding by the Department of the Senate and the Department of Finance. That review recommended a small increase in administrative funding to cover advertising and interstate hearings in particular and also the provision of extra staff to cover the extra workload engendered by the system that we put in place in 1989 where we invite direct input by experts and interest groups&mdash;indeed, any interested Australian, into the committee stage of any bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That system has been working very well. We refer about 50 bills a year. We do get very interesting input and we often change the way we are going to vote on bills because of that. It has support right across the board from all parties and it is something that has been working well. So this joint review by the Department of the Senate and Department of Finance officers recommended those extra things.    </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1529">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note that there has not been&mdash;I hope there has not&mdash;a final decision on that. One research officer class 4 has been implemented to committees. The principal research officer grade 6 has been rejected and the extra administrative costs per committee have also been rejected. So we should keep in mind that the system we have, which we put in place in 1989 with support from everywhere and where we do get input into bills from Australians, experts and public interest groups, is something that may well start falling down if we do not have this money. That is something we have to keep in mind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing that committee of officers recommended we look at is that select committees are something this parliament sets up&mdash;and indeed I believe the House of Representatives does occasionally, too&mdash;to look at large and important issues which are not covered in general or which are so important that they are not believed to be covered in general by other Senate committees. This select committee system has been used for many years by all parties to great effect. In particular, the last opposition, the current government, used it to great effect in the last parliament and the parliament before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a system which is now in enormous danger of having no funding at all. The reason for that is that we already have two select committees, which are virtually standing committees now and ought to be covered under running costs. As it is, the community standards committee, which Senator Harradine had set up again this week, and the superannuation committee will be funded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also set up another two select committees. The funding for those two select committees is going to have to be found from the running costs of the Senate. It may be about half a million dollars. It may be a lot less, but it is a lot of money. If we try and set up any other select committees, that funding will also have to be found from the running costs of the Senate. This is something that I think we should all think about very closely when we look at supply, when we look at the way the Senate is being funded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This committee system is something which has worked very well over many years. The <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> select committee system has worked very well over many years. The references and legislative committees and the Friday committees that we all use so much have worked very well over many years and these are all in danger. They are in danger now because of problems with funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those problems with funding are problems of interpretation of the review of the Senate officers and the Department of Finance officers. It seemed to me that the review was very clear in recommending this funding and that the finance department officers recommended it just as much as the Senate department officers. It apparently seems now, to the Department of Finance or to the minister, that this is not the case. I think we have to have a very close look at the interpretation of that funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to keep in mind that Senate committees are the main area where the Australian people have scrutiny over what the parliament does and where the Australian parliament has scrutiny over what the executive does. This is so important in our system of governance. Senator Ian Macdonald just said that he believes&mdash;he used the M word again&mdash;that this government has the mandate to democratically do certain things. I believe that this government has a mandate&mdash;it was very clear before the election&mdash;to make sure that the parliament is supreme over the executive. They certainly have that mandate. They have the mandate to do a lot of funding things, but the main mandate of Mr Howard is to not be Mr Keating. At the moment, if you have a look at how the House of Representatives is working, he is not doing that particularly well either.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The one thing I felt I had to say while we were on these supply bills is that we must look very carefully at exactly how we fund Senate committees, that the funding of Senate committees is a basic funding that looks after the democratic rights of all Australians to look into what the parliament is doing and the rights of parliament to look into what the executive is doing. That is an essential right and it is something that every single Australian is going to be caught up by if this is cut <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1530"> too far and if the interpretation of that review is allowed to stand.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are talking about the cognate supply bills. These are machinery bills. In effect, what they are doing is authorising the expenditure for the interim period from the end of June until the appropriation bills, which follow the budget, are passed through the parliament. These bills authorise expenditure by the government for that five-month period, but it is in effect an extension of the previous government's budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are virtually no changes in these bills from the previous government's budget of last year. It is an extension of those numbers, simply on a five&hyphen;twelfths basis.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second matter I raise in the Senate is the matter of funding of parliament, which was raised at considerable length by Senator Harradine, supported by Senator Bourne. It is important for the Senate and the Australian people to realise that, first of all, the two per cent efficiency dividend and, secondly, the proposal to reduce the costs of the total parliament by $10 million per annum were proposals of the previous government, not the current government.

The government is concerned and does support the workings of the parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to spend a couple of minutes speaking on the matter of the budget deficit, which was raised by opposition senators. We have had quite significant economic growth in this country for the last several years, reinforced by the March quarter numbers which were released this week. But I remind the Australian community that, in spite of significant economic growth over the last four and a half years, the previous government basically ran the Commonwealth quarter of the economy at a loss. It spent a lot more than it got in income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me run over some of the numbers since former Prime Minister Keating took office in December 1991. In the first full year of his reign, 1992-93, income received from all taxpayers was $95 billion. The figure for the current financial year, which finishes in a few weeks time, is $124 billion. So in that time income has increased by over 30 per cent. The previous government spent all of that. If you go out and ask people in small, medium or big businesses whether any of them have had a 30 per cent increase in revenue over the last four years, very few people put up their hands. State governments have not had that increase. But the Commonwealth government has.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to spending that, they also went out and borrowed. As at 30 June 1991, five months before Mr Keating became Prime Minister, Commonwealth debt stood at $32 billion. Today it is virtually $100 billion. So over the almost five-year period, another $60-odd billion was borrowed on the Australian market, and they spent that. In addition, in the same four&hyphen;year period, some of the silver was sold off. The total of $8.7 billion from the sale of Qantas, half the Commonwealth Bank, CSL and a few smaller bits and pieces has been spent also. In addition, back in the mid- <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1531">1980s, about eight per cent of Commonwealth outlays went into infrastructure. It was investment in the future. By the time Mr Keating became Prime Minister in December 1991, that figure was down to about 4.7 per cent. It dropped even further, so that this current financial year it is actually a negative figure&mdash;minus 2.3 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every household knows that you cannot spend beyond your income. You cannot sell off the house to pay for the groceries. If you do, you end up in trouble. That is exactly what happened with the previous government. That is why we are in a mess. The previous government also fudged the figures by not changing the financial reporting standards. The coalition made a commitment before the election that it was going to change the financial reporting standards and move to accrual accounting. That will separate the assets and liabilities&mdash;in other words, the balance sheet items or the house items&mdash;and the operating expenses, the groceries. By doing that, it will then be plain to everybody what has really happened to the Commonwealth's finances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government did a very poor job and left us with a great debt, which we have to rein in. We have been living beyond our means and that is why we have Treasury's estimate, not the government's estimate, of an $8 billion deficit. The supply bills are machinery bills so that the business of government can continue for the next five months. On behalf of the government, I thank all honourable senators for their contributions in this debate this morning. I have covered a wide range of matters in my response.</PARA>

I was only made aware of them&mdash;and I understand that this is also the case for the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Short)&mdash;last night. We do not believe that it is appropriate for the chamber to be looking at the details in committee now. As I said earlier, these are simply machinery bills which carry on the budget appropriations of the previous government for the five months until the new budget comes down. There are virtually no changes.</PARA></TALK.START>

If we are unable to answer those questions, I give you the assurance that we will take those questions on notice and endeavour to get back to you with detailed answers over the next fortnight&mdash;that is, before we resume the next sittings.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just want to make a brief comment about the questions and the response of Senator Gibson. From the Labor opposition's point of view, we took an approach to today based on the fact that we want to get the supply bills through. As Senator Gibson has said, the bills are essentially about because of the election and the budget having been deferred to August, and there is no argument between us and the government on that fact at least.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have four or five other pieces of legislation that are listed on this special day. We believe it is important to pass the supply bills and the other legislation today.

You should share your concerns about the issues you have raised and many more and as an opposition <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1532"> we will raise those concerns in question time and in a whole variety of other forums such as in speeches, et cetera.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As has been mentioned, today we are dealing with supply bills that relate to government spending from June until appropriations. Many people who have listened to question time over the last few weeks have noticed that a number of the questions asked have not related to the budget but to changes that are being made now or changes that are being asked now of departments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even today you will notice that the answers to questions or concerns put forward by Senator Harradine and Senator Bourne relating to the operations, for instance, of the Senate, are `Wait and see,' `We haven't finalised . . . ', `We will announce these in the budget,' et cetera. They are not answers. They do not actually admit to the changes that are being asked of those departments now, not in September or October.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has not been a forum. So far in question time the response from government has been, `Wait until the budget. We're not going to talk about it.' We are talking about the changes from June until the budget, until appropriations. Yes, it is five months that we are talking about. If there are changes such as staffing changes now, it is not good enough to say, `Wait and see,' because they are actually happening now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us ask a test question now. Senator Harradine has been talking about Senate cutback concerns. The amount provided here for the Senate's running costs is about 47 per cent of the total, which is more than five&hyphen;twelfths of the year. However, we are hearing that staff cuts are occurring now in the Senate. Could somebody please give me an idea of what the Senate staff cuts will be between now and the budget, in particular in the Senate committee staff?</PARA></SPEECH>

That was the previous government's decision and these bills are simply the continuation of the previous government's decisions. The bills do not cover anything except some very minor negligible decisions that have been taken since we have been in government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1533"> understand it, there are no staff cuts envisaged before the end of the financial year, although clearly planning for the next financial year will involve very substantial cuts right across the five parliamentary departments. The ongoing difficulty we have in negotiating these cuts with the government goes to the agreements that we felt we had made with the previous government through the Minister for Finance for the funding of committees. Those agreements came out of the Senate committee office review of resources, which was a report coming out of meetings between Finance and Senate officers. Eventually it was the subject of discussion between myself and a team of people from the Appropriations and Staffing Committee and the Minister for Finance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The agreement which came out of those discussions was that in this round of budget estimates we would go for funding for an additional parliamentary officer class 4 for each pair of legislative and general purpose committees, a point which is now in question. We were concerned also about the apparent repudiation of what we thought was a clear agreement on the funding of select committees. That agreement was to change the funding arrangements and make two of those select committees funded as part of the general funding of the Senate. Any additional ones over and above the normal load of those two committees in terms of hours over a year would be funded separately and bids would have to be made for that. There seems to have been a change at officer level anyway. We are not sure whether that is at minister level and that is the subject of negotiations now. I hope that answers the question.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator, that is subject to discussion. Certainly the correspondence to date would seem to indicate that that is the case, that it is simply <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> two committees and no more will be funded. That is, though, subject to discussions. It has been taken up by the Appropriations and Staffing Committee, and I have written to the minister on behalf of the Appropriations and Staffing Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other matter raised as an additional concern of ours is that we have been asked to make submissions for, for example, the funding of the parliamentary officers class four to each pair of legislative and general purpose committees as part of a global budget for all five departments, and we have made the point that that is constitutionally inappropriate, that the chamber departments should be making separate submissions and should be separately funded and separately considered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That point has also been made, as has the concern that the Senate has a set process for dealing with all these budget matters, and that process involves agreement of the Appropriations and Staffing Committee to any proposals put forward by me and then negotiation through the Minister for Finance&mdash;who appears before ERC on our behalf&mdash;by the Appropriations and Staffing Committee directly with the Minister for Finance. That is something we have had constant trouble with under all governments, and it is something that we have made a very strong plea on in the letter we have sent to the current minister.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the minister. It is very interesting that some of the changes have been figured into these figures because we were given to understand just a little while ago that it was absolutely unreasonable for us to expect that changes in staffing cuts were incorporated in these figures. We were told that these figures were a reflection of the previous government's decisions. So when there have been departmental changes, some have been reflected in these figures and others have not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The answer before, `We have no idea of what the changes will be, but we will include some and not include others. Don't expect us to know what the outcomes will be,' seems to be rather extraordinary. We were told, `These are just five-twelfths. Don't worry, Senator, we don't have to justify or account for any of these figures. We have plucked them out of the air from the previous government.' This is extraordinary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If areas that we know are losing, say, 10 per cent or more of their staff&mdash;especially areas where government has announced it wants to make cuts&mdash;get appropriations in this <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> bill as if they were going to continue as they currently do, what does that mean when, for instance, Environment gets appropriations of about 10 per cent less than we would expect from the appropriation extrapolation of last year's budget? Where does that figure come from? Is it plucked out of the air? What does it mean when we are saying we are not including any of these current cuts?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe it is seriously misleading to present an appropriation for a program you have no intention of implementing or you believe is unlikely to be implemented. It is an abuse of accountability. It ties up the revenue which appears not to be available when in fact it is known to be so. This means that other worthy programs or uses, including the discharge of debt, may be denied on the presumption that the revenue has already been appropriated for some purpose. I also think that any Commonwealth department or program that cannot give a reasonably accurate indication of activity for the next five months is in serious trouble or has been badly mismanaged.</PARA></SPEECH>

We can continue asking them question by question, and certainly we will put a number of these questions on notice, but I would certainly like to know how many of the current programs have been frozen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard, for instance, that tertiary tutorial assistance for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people has been frozen. We have heard about contracts by the government with providers of English as a second language for those people who you have announced you will not assist with social security, newly arrived immigrants. Funds for contracted courses for English as a second language have been frozen for people who have signed contracts. Is this our imagination? Where is the press release that has announced these programs? When will it be legitimate for this Senate to ask why some programs have been frozen now&mdash;not in the future, not in the budget and not in a past government?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had a letter passed on to me today from Wanneroo accommodation and support services. I have had indications that there are <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1544"> unemployed people being denied support and that 13,000 unemployed people will not be assisted following a decision by Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, to reduce the level of funding to skillshare projects to 30 per cent between July and September this year&mdash;not in the future, not in the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People know these things because they are in the community. The people involved in those programs that are having their funds frozen have not, in many cases, been given any explanation or been officially advised by anybody, and they cannot get any details. Where is the accountability? If you can tell us&mdash;if you are going to&mdash;we would be very happy to get a full list of the staffing cuts to departments now.

At least people would know, in relation to that level of uncertainty, what their future is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am happy to put a number of these questions on notice, but some of them are not small changes. At section 4, under local government programs, there seems to be an allocation 48 per cent below the proportion which would indicate that the funding would be maintained at the current level. That is a pretty large decrease. Why are local government services being cut in this way? Are programs going to be cut and introduced and implemented at a reduced level? Local government in fact did get some serious underspendings from the previous government in areas where their regional economic development organisations were not ready to be set up.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Leader of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1546"> Government in the Senate (Senator Hill). I think he has picked up the point that we have been trying to make. I appreciate his comments that we are doing nothing but fulfilling our responsibility in the Senate in asking these questions. We do agree that there is a waste of time involved in asking questions for which answers are not available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind colleagues who may not be quite as understanding as the minister has been that, basically, we are being asked to pass a bill in this place. We are being asked to pass the supply bills. Presumably, we have a right to know what we are passing when we are passing them. If we do not have adequate information, there is no capacity to comment on or make amendments or requests to the legislation, or just simply to make known on the public record the community views on these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One example I would like to give is that of the national agenda for women's grants program, which ends on 30 June. There has been total silence from the coalition government on this essential grants program. If funding for this program does not continue past 30 June, the 20 national women's organisations which are currently funded under this program have a big question mark over their future existence.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe these organisations have made requests to the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women (Senator Newman) and have received no response other than that they must wait until after the budget in August.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We appreciate Senator Hill's comments, and those of Senator Short yesterday, that we will be given answers to our questions if we incorporate them. I agree to incorporate my questions; however, some of them are not in a form which would make them easy to incorporate. I hope that you will give me some leeway to type them up and send them to you. I would like to present the questions, which we would have asked in the committee stage in an informal way, more accurately for the departments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very glad to see that you appreciate the problems the community faces concerning the period between 30 June and when you make your budget announcements. I was <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> saying earlier that I feel some degree of sympathy for you for the new role you are taking on. I have a degree of criticism for and scepticism about the other opposition parties because I feel that this is not to be seen as the Greens holding the government to ransom in the Senate or obstructing. We are actually doing our job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To pre-empt any of those unkind and unfair comments, I would like to place on the record that we perceive that this is the only appropriate venue for doing this. We are very glad for the offer of other ways in which to gain the information  we require, but I remind the government that we are being asked to pass a bill without that information. I think that is what you are asking. Senator Hill might like to clarify that. While we do appreciate the offer to put questions on notice and get answers within the next two weeks, I think you are asking us to have faith that they will be provided and to pass the bills anyway, am I correct?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will very briefly place on the record the opposition's position on this particular matter. I think it is atypical that supply bills come before the Senate. As senators would be aware, this is something that we have not seen since the timing of the budget was changed. When in government, the Australian Labor Party took the view that the estimates process should be conducted around the time of the debate on the appropriation bills and the supplementary appropriation bills. We do believe that that is a proper course of action. It is for that reason that the opposition has not participated, and will not be participating, in the committee stage debate on the supply bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1547"> I would say for the record that the opposition shares many of the concerns that have been raised by both Senator Margetts and Senator Chamarette. Many of the issues of concern to both those senators are of concern to opposition senators. They will be the subject of considerable scrutiny by the oppo sition in the appropriate forum, which is the estimates committee process. We will have the opportunity at that time to examine annual reports and the appropriation bills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did think it was appropriate that I place on record, on behalf of the opposition, a clear indication of why we have not participated in this committee stage debate. It was my suggestion at an informal meeting of senators and party leaders that the Senate sit this Friday so that we could work through some of the legislation that is before us, given the very obvious mismanagement by the government of its program. I put forward that particular suggestion, which obviously had not crossed the minds of government members. They are new at this business, so I suppose they are trying to learn on the run. It is a pity they cannot learn a little quicker than they appear to be at this stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This suggestion that the opposition made in good faith for the Senate to sit this Friday would probably be acknowledged by Senator Chamarette and Senator Margetts in the informal discussions that we have had. Obviously I am interested in seeing business proceed as quickly as possible. However, given that the nature of this debate has come under some discussion, I wanted to place on record the opposition's approach to this committee stage debate on the supply bills.</PARA>

Senator Macdonald asks, `Why didn't the Greens send Telstra off to a legislative committee?' That is a very good point. He probably was not in the chamber at the time to hear our reasons. The reason is that an unfortunate development is occurring as a result of a division between reference committees and legislation committees. Because the government are, in effect, able to control a particular committee, often they see their role as being the protection of legislation. That has often meant that not only the legislation but also its wider impacts have not been looked at in detail. A legislation committee has a term of reference&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

That is why the Greens (WA) have been making the points they have this morning, which I have listened to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the Hawke government won government, when there was a change of government previously in March, it put an estimates process in place in May. That has not happened this time, despite your offer of a charter of budget honesty and all the rest of it. It is an important matter of process that we are being asked to sign off on. We are being asked to pass these important supply bills in good faith&mdash;that is, what you say you are going to do&mdash;and in the absence of certain information. That is a big ask.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed Bill will make amendments to the provisions in the Migration Act 1958 (the Act) relating to the Migration Agents Registration Scheme (MARS).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">MARS was established to provide consumer protection for visa applicants from unscrupulous and/or incompetent migration agents.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reasons for introduction and passage in 1996 winter sittings</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subsection 333(1) of the MARS provisions contains a statutory sunset provision which will automatically terminate the entire scheme on 21 September 1996. The sunset provision was originally designed to allow MARS to run for an initial three years (until September 1995) but was extended for one year by the Migration Legislation Amendment Act (No. 5) 1995. The one year extension to allow time for the JSCM to report on the operation of MARS and for the government to make a considered response.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To enable MARS to continue after 21 September 1996, it is essential that the migration act be amended before that date.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is intended that the scheme be extended for one year. This will allow a further review of the scheme with particular emphasis on the possibility that it might be replaced by enhanced self&hyphen;regulation.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill is intended to achieve the revenue savings announced in December 1995, which are scheduled to commence from 1 July 1996. This can only be attained by the consideration of this bill in the current sittings of parliament.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill gives effect to the Customs Tariff duty rate changes announced on 8 May 1996.

It changes from `free' to `3%' the concessional duty rate applying to Tariff Concession Orders under part XVA of the customs act (as delivered by items 19 and 50 of schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff Act 1995) and increases by the same amount the duty applying to policy by&hyphen;law items 47, 55, 57 and 60. The concessional rate of duty for the three policy by&hyphen;law items which are to be administered on a project basis (items 45, 46 and 56) will remain at `free', and the two policy by&hyphen;law items (items 43 and 52) relating to split consignments of whole goods unable to be transported on a single vessel or aircraft because of the size of the goods or because of an inadvertent delay in shipment will retain the duty rate currently applicable for the whole goods stock.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If this bill is not dealt with in these sittings, there will be a delay in the implementation of the measures which will cause a shortfall in revenue collected stock.

I was not here all the time but officers from the department have taken notes and provided some responses to some of the remarks that were made. I will try to be as brief as possible because I know there are other matters to be dealt with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Stott Despoja, I understand, expressed concerns that some of the non-government school funding may flow to wealthier non-government schools. Senator Stott Despoja should feel assured that that is not the intention. The $20.7 million for non-government schools capital is targeted to higher needs schools. Specifically, this additional assistance will provide assistance for technological advances in schools, about $17 million; Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander support, $2.5 million; and hostels for rural students, $1 million. I can also assure the senator that the additional $20.7 million for non-government schools capital is just that&mdash;additional funding. It does not come at the expense of funding for government schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the query about Dr Kemp's announcement of more flexible funding for non-government schools, what I can say is that general recurrent grants for non-government schools under the policies of the previous government were purportedly based on financial need. However, there are now 25,000 students in non-government schools who have received less general recurrent funding than what they should have been entitled to had the Labor government not introduced its unfair and inequitable new schools funding arrangement in 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both Senator Carr and Senator Stott Despoja made some references to the government's proposed training wage under the MAATS proposal. I can assure senators in relation to the proposed industrial relation arrangements the government's take-home pay commitment is rock solid and will apply to trainees and apprentices. The existing award based apprenticeship and traineeship arrangements will continue. Employers can continue to choose to access them if they so wish. That includes the national training wage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the proposed Australian workplace agreements, the amount of time spent in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> training will determine the amount of time for which the trainee is paid. That rate of pay will be the rate set out in the relevant award. The principle of paying trainees and apprentices for the time they spend in productive work is a sound one. In fact, Labor's national training wage is based on the principle that time spent in training is not paid for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Carr had some additional comments with respect to apprenticeship and traineeship numbers. He claimed that under Labor there was massive growth in apprenticeship numbers. While it is true that apprenticeship commencements increased in the 1980s, that is not the whole story because they then declined markedly in the early 1990s and have only recently increased again. In 1984&hyphen;85 there were just under 50,000 apprenticeship commencements. In 1994-95, 10 years later, there were still just under 50,000 apprenticeship commencements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is committed to expanding opportunities for apprenticeship and traineeship arrangements, but increased flexibility and delivery arrangements to make sure that the training provided is relevant to workplace needs is essential. Employers can continue to choose existing apprenticeships and traineeships but they should also be able to take the opportunity for other models of work based training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government and many sectors of industry value highly the traditional apprenticeship model, but there is no need to be absolutely bound by it. We need to provide maximum variety and flexibility in training delivery to meet the needs of emerging industries and industries where the structured training effort has traditionally been quite low&mdash;the very areas where the training guarantee did not have significant impact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1556"> Senator Margetts, in her contribution, indicated that she opposed the abolition of the training guarantee. I think there is probably some agreement with respect to the government and opposition. The opposition introduced this when they were in government. We said it would not be as effective as they hoped it would be. The fact they abandoned it indicated that we were right in concluding that at the time. In conclusion, I thank sena tors for their sensible contributions they have made, albeit I have not necessarily agreed with all of them.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Housing Assistance Bill 1996 was originally introduced by the previous Labor government. It was introduced in the last session of the parliament but was not proceeded with because of the election. It was designed to give effect to the major reforms of housing that had been proposed by Brian Howe in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Community and Nation</EMPHASIS> . It is important to point out during this second reading debate that, while in many areas the bill remains identical with that introduced by the previous government, there are some substantive differences between the version of the bill that had previously been introduced and this bill that we are debating today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sensitive to the fact that we have a number of matters to deal with this afternoon, but I would like to quickly touch on those areas of substantive difference during my second reading contribution. The first is that, I understand, interim agreements will operate for only one year. That effectively means that states and territories have only 12 months to completely reconfigure their public housing arrangements before new arrangements start in 1997-98. Also, funds are appropriated for only one year. That means that states and territories have no security of funding. Not only are they being required to reconfigure these arrangements within 12 months, but they also have no Commonwealth offer as to what funds might be available after that time. The reference to urban planning and design has been omitted from the version of the bill that we are debating today.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Negotiations with states and territory governments were well advanced on both the interim arrangements and on the agreement covering longer term housing reform. I understand that these negotiations are largely back to square one. State and territory housing ministers met in Melbourne last Friday to discuss these very important issues. My understanding is that Senator Newman, as the responsible minister, did not attend that meeting. She was able to inform the Senate yesterday that there were many other meetings that she has managed to get to, but I do not believe she was able to make that one. I do not think Senator Kemp, as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security, managed to get along. I suppose that is some indication of the level of importance that this new government attaches to social housing and the need for substantial reform. It is disappointing that apparently the issues are not important enough for one of the elected representatives of the government to attend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday, we had widely reported the fact that Mr Craig Knowles, the Minister for Urban Affairs and Planning and Minister for Housing in the New South Wales government, had described the coalition's housing funding plan as a `social and economic disaster'. We saw again yesterday in question time Senator Newman unable or unwilling to answer some absolutely crucial issues in relation to the offer that the Commonwealth has put on the table to state and territory governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It appears that the latest proposal means no capital for new housing stock; no indication or commitment from the government that it will protect new public housing tenants&mdash;the government, in fact, just not coming clean on the issue of arrangements for new public housing tenants. I would suggest to honourable senators that they have a close look at what Mr Knowles said yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a very clear indication that what this Commonwealth government is about is a reduction to cut state and territory housing funding, the national housing budget, by some $&half; billion&mdash;$500 million, or 33 per cent of the national housing budget. The social and economic consequences of that proposal will be absolutely enormous.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1557">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not take the view that housing is just about bricks and mortar. We never have, in the Labor Party, done that and we will not be doing so in the future. We do not want to see a situation arise where housing is provided without the providers being cognisant of the need to ensure that housing is appropriately located; that it is accessible to a range of services that people need; and that issues such as employment opportunities, transport and so forth are addressed. I can assure you that those policy imperatives will remain uppermost in the mind of the opposition as we address these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of the time constraints that are on us today&mdash;which the opposition has been mindful of and obviously keen to cooperate with to ensure that, as much as possible, we deal with those bills before us&mdash;I will not take any more of the Senate's time for this brief second reading contribution. However, I would like to take the opportunity to draw to the Senate's attention the remarks that were made on this bill by my colleagues in the House of Representatives. I will also be taking the opportunity of moving substantive amendments during the committee stage of the bill. I say to the Senate that the opposition will be supporting the second reading of this bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats will be supporting the Housing Assistance Bill. We will consider the proposed amendments of the Greens (WA) and the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Faulkner) when we see those. This bill lays the groundwork for the formulation of the Commonwealth-state housing agreement. With the exception of a few changes, it is basically the same bill that was introduced into the parliament during last session, as Senator Faulkner has said.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do support this bill, but not without some serious reservations about the current direction of the agreement. The direction, I might add, was well and truly put in place by the Labor government. Our main concern is that this agreement continues to slide away from a strong and solid commitment to public housing. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even though it may be in the guise of a commitment to `community housing', more rental assistance or a `broader range of options'&mdash;the rhetoric contained in this bill&mdash;the heart of the matter is that the previous government began a trend, which I think this coalition is continuing, away from building new public housing stock and away from providing public housing. It is all very well for the Australian Labor Party to sit in here and talk about how committed it was to the provision of public housing, but I am afraid that the facts speak for themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the previous government, funds for public housing under the Commonwealth-state housing agreement fell by 40 per cent in real terms between the years 1986 and 1995. That is about $100 million which could have been spent on housing for Australians but was not. In the last six years of the Labor government, the number of new public housing units built fell by more than half, from 14,000 to 6,000. The number of families on public housing waiting lists blew out from 200,000 to more than 235,000. Not only that, in last year's budget the Labor government made a decision to cut rent assistance to low income families, a move that the Democrats opposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not just a question of funding. Every time the Labor government had a chance to increase the money levels available for public housing, it seemed to run away from that as fast as it could. For example, last year in this place my colleague Senator Spindler asked the government whether it would ensure that at least 10 per cent of the Australian Defence Industry site in the inner&hyphen;west of Melbourne was transferred to the Victorian government for public housing. That was an enormous site, with some 500,000 houses to be built on it. There is a chronic shortage of private and public rental housing in Melbourne's inner-west suburbs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1558"> But we did not see the then government rush to ensure that either five per cent or 10 per cent of the site was set aside for public housing. That is unfortunate. The government washed its hands of that matter and refused to do anything. Apparently, it would not even get on the phone and nicely suggest to the ADI, which is fully owned by the Common wealth, that they might consider that proposal. So we are a little wary when the Labor Party comes in here and talks about how committed they were to the provision of public housing, especially for low income earners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that in this area&mdash;and in so many other areas&mdash;the previous government began a trend and handed to this government on a plate a system that is already depleted of funds, already run down and already close to breaking point. Emergency housing workers, local government social workers, family support workers and youth workers will tell you the same story of how they are unable to find housing for women who are trying to escape from domestic abuse. They will tell you stories of homeless families who are sleeping in shelters because they cannot afford the rent on the private market and cannot get into public housing. They will tell you about unemployed people, aged pensioners, people with disabilities and other low income earners who are struggling to pay the rent in substandard and overpriced private rental properties.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President. I assume that they are discussing the previous government's commitment to public housing in the Commonwealth state-housing agreement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you talk to any social worker or youth worker they will tell you the same story. They will tell you about run&hyphen;down, damaged and poor quality public housing stock which is not being replaced and is not being restored. They will tell you about elderly people trying to cope with life 10 storeys high in high-rise public housing in Melbourne, and in Sydney, because there is no alternative public housing for them. That is what is happening out there in the real world, and I think it is important to get that on the record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite all the nice sounding rhetoric from this government, and the previous government, that is the trend that was begun by the ALP. If this bill is any guide, it is a trend that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will be continued by the coalition government. They seem quite happy to go down the same path. Perhaps the most disturbing thing about this bill is that the agreement it sets up will operate for one financial year only. The agreements under the previous government's bill&mdash;unsatisfactory as the Democrats considered them to be&mdash;were at least going to continue for three years. I concur with Senator Faulkner's previous comments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I accept that the government needs to keep its budgetary options open, I find this is a bit ominous. It smacks of an intention to further pare back public housing  assistance over subsequent financial years and of an unwillingness to commit to an ongoing and significant program of public housing. The other concern I have is that this government seems to think, as with the previous government, that it can boost housing choice for people on low incomes through the private rental market. That might look good on paper but it does not work in the real world.</PARA>

It is one thing to involve the private sector in the planning and construction of public housing stock&mdash;that is appropriate and perhaps even desirable&mdash;but it is another thing altogether to use taxpayers' money to subsidise private involvement when you do not end up even owning stock. I remind the government that if we do not own the stock then not only are we not in a position to manage it appropriately and according to need but also we are not in a position to realise a gain, albeit a long&hyphen;term one, by selling some stock off over a period to low income earners.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1559">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In short, the Democrats have been saying for some time that housing policy in this country continues to be both socially irresponsible and economically short&hyphen;sighted. I do not see that this bill changes much at all. I call attention to the comments made yesterday by the New South Wales housing minister, Mr Knowles, warning of the federal government trying to cut housing costs by a third, or around $500 million. I notice that the draft agenda for the 13&hyphen;14 June COAG meeting talks of cost containment in housing. I think that is of concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I conclude by noting the comments of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Senator Kemp) in the second reading speech. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this bill is based on the principle that all Australians, regardless of their economic or social status, have the right to affordable, secure and appropriate housing.</PARA>
<PARA>I hope that the government's budget commitments, unlike the previous government's, live to up that rhetoric. The Democrats commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This housing bill is far from being non&hyphen;controversial. It is not just a technical bill; it is an important bill. It is a bill that is having significant implications for the public and for state governments. I believe it certainly was inappropriate for it to be brought up for lunchtime debate yesterday. The reason it is important is that the issues canvassed get an airing when senators are available to listen to debate, even if it is from their offices. Everybody deserves some sort of break during the day. If you try to push through an important bill like this during lunchtime then the average senator in this place will not be able to hear the debate that is occurring because they are eating their lunch, which normal people usually do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill concerns the next Commonwealth-state housing agreement, CSHA, scheduled to start in about one month. It is not a simple addition to the existing act. It is actually a substantial change. It is also not identical to the bill that the last government proposed to establish a new CSHA. The bill was introduced into the House of Representatives only <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> on 8 May&mdash;that is about three weeks ago. It was not introduced into the Senate until Wednesday of this week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the Greens (WA), the new CSHA is a significant event. It is to be, amongst other things, the agreement where public housing begins to take into account the social and environmental aspects of public housing implementation, and where conditions and benchmarks are set regarding these aspects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that this bill was introduced on Wednesday and that there are substantial changes, it is not unreasonable to think that proper consideration of this bill can take place, firstly, so that it can be considered and reviewed correctly and, secondly, so that, if there is necessity for amendments to be moved, which we would like to see and table, then there is reasonable time for that process to take place. Therefore, I give notice that, at the end of my contribution to the second reading debate, I will be asking, in fairness and due to the limited time that has been available, to go to the next bill to allow us time to properly prepare for the committee stage of this bill rather than rush this bill through with this unseemly haste.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were always going to be concerned about these things in this bill, no matter which government proposed the new CSHA. The fact that it is being proposed by a government that seems more preoccupied with gutting social support and overriding environmental considerations makes us more deeply concerned. The fact that this has been promoted as shifting the responsibility for public housing to the states is also a cause for concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will not go into that issue too deeply at this stage, I will simply flag the fact that we intend to move a number of amendments to this bill in order to ensure that the social and environmental aspects of public housing are addressed and that funding transfers to the states are made conditional upon positive outcomes in these areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take the time to make the point that public housing, and housing and urban design in general have an effect on our greenhouse performance. Urban design and building design and standards are often ignored in the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1560"> greenhouse debate because they are difficult. Poor planning is very hard and expensive to remedy. Retrofitting and changing established urban forms is very expensive and very hard to get support for and agreement on. But doing something right at the planning stage is relatively easy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In housing we are talking about physical objects meant to last decades. If we are going to make changes that are meant to last decades from now, this is the time to do the right thing and to do the thing which will end up saving us money in the long run. We pay for our mistakes for decades. Alternatively, we can reap the benefits of forethought and planning for decades. Costs may be direct&mdash;payment to build new power plants, roads, powerlines and schools&mdash;or they may be indirect, such as costs to the agricultural productivity due to climate change, costs to children of increased lead emissions from old cars driven from outlying suburbs, or costs to society of dislocation, alienation and the creation of welfare ghettos and the associated mind&hyphen;sets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Future costs or future benefits?&mdash;that is what this bill is really about. Short-term bottom line thinking will create costs the beneficiaries of these programs will begin to pay from the time they move in. The costs to society may not fall due until a couple of years afterwards, although that is not necessarily the case. If we do have a commitment to public housing or a decent standard of housing, do we have a commitment to enable those people who occupy that housing to reduce their energy costs and to reduce the ongoing costs even to government if it gives assistance for things such as energy bills?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will be important in the greenhouse debate. Public housing has been notably lacking in its attention to the principles promoted by government in energy efficiency. There are, however, some exceptions. In estimates processes in years gone by we have noticed that the Department of Defence is beginning to put standards of energy efficiency in its housing. It is looking at arid land gardens, at passive solar design and at ways of incorporating that into its housing design. What a good idea I thought. And, yes, I gave </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA>bouquets to Defence for doing that, even though I have problems with other aspects of its environmental program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But doesn't it make you wonder why one department and not other departments are choosing to go along this road? The answer seems to be fairly clear. Defence get to keep their savings. The savings that are made as a result of the lower running costs of Defence housing are kept by Defence and used for other things; whereas other departments have to pay back those savings into general revenue or, if savings are accrued by state governments as a result of there being less cost in having to produce energy and so on, it is the state governments who gain that. So, unfortunately in our system, part of the problem of implementing good greenhouse policy is that those who implement the changes are not necessarily the ones who see the immediate benefits. This has to be changed and it has to be integrated through the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Houses are often not well insulated, and this greatly increases the costs of space heating or cooling. They are often poorly designed from a thermal standpoint. They usually fail to integrate things such as fluorescent lighting or solar hot water heating. They ignore issues such as water conservation. They do not necessarily have dual-flush toilets or water conserving showerheads. They ignore issues of solar orientation, window size, eave overhang and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we heard the other day in answer to a question about recycled paper&mdash;that is, `We'll only do it if the immediate costs are cheaper'&mdash;if the Commonwealth does not take the lead, how can we expect the rest of the community to follow? These are simple and often inexpensive things in the design and construction stage, but they are difficult and expensive to change in a built house. Failure to change them locks the tenants into either high energy use, and consequent high costs and high greenhouse emissions, or a life of misery&mdash;shivering through winter in unheated houses and roasting through summer in prefab ovens. Proper design and insulation can virtually eliminate the need for space heating and cooling.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1561">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We keep telling consumers, ordinary people, that greenhouse emissions are their responsibility. We advise them to use compact fluorescent light globes at $20 each, when an installation for an 18-inch fluorescent baton, plus a baton that is full solar spectrum and flicker&hyphen;free, costs only about $25. Afterwards, a replacement baton of a similar high quality costs about $5 to replace and lasts longer than a compact fluoro and is more energy efficient. Therefore, in building, we are making the wrong decisions. If such fluoros are designed in, they can provide soft diffused light. There is no need for the fluoro bar hanging in the kitchen any more than there is a need for the bare globe hanging from a chord. There are attractive inset fixtures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do virtually nothing for ordinary people who are trying to do their part for the planet. We actually make it difficult for them. It is fine to give a very small partial subsidy to people who are putting in a solar hot water system on the roof&mdash;which, when we questioned this matter further with the previous government, ended up to be a rather pathetic loan scheme at about normal loan rates&mdash;but it is still an expensive proposition. Poorer householders can do nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Residents in rental housing are even worse off. They could not retrofit the house even if they could afford it. They have to cop the outcomes of the landlords economising in terms of power bills&mdash;cold uncomfortable winters and hot summers. This will either decrease quality of life markedly or entail an increase in costs borne by the renter. For poor people, especially the elderly or those with small children, poor heating in winter can have serious medical consequences. So-called environmental measures are often important social justice measures and measures to assure a reasonable quality of life at a reasonable cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I bring these things up in the context of this bill, because public housing is a major option for poor people. It is often the only way they will get affordable housing. If public housing does not include basic environmental design, then it is the government that penalises the poor. To date, on a number of occasions when I have asked these kinds of questions during <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Senate estimates, the kinds of answers I hear are, `But, Senator, you're talking about the environment; we're talking about economic development.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite frankly, if you continue to separate housing and regional economic development you will find that there will be, amongst other things, an economic cost. But the reality is that any government which says that they have a commitment to equity, access and environmental standards should be incorporating these principles in each department. There should be environmental statements on or environmental assessments of any program changes so that we know what the impacts will be and whether there are spending changes or program changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I mentioned, I have followed this area with interest in estimates committees and elsewhere. When I came here I discovered that the better cities program was a good program. It was advocating, demonstrating and spending hundreds of millions of dollars per year to promote energy efficiency and ecologically based urban restructuring; yet the billion or so dollars spent on public housing incorporates almost none of the principles promoted in the better cities program or in other programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When questions were asked about this, the reply was, `But it will cost too much.' There was very little, if any, information proffered by the departments about their looking for existing information on the actual cost of implementing those programs and the relatively short turnaround time in those programs paying for themselves&mdash;especially if you are talking about the cost to people who have no other choice but to live in those kinds of houses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Programs were being operated in the same program area. Some of those programs were looking at energy efficient housing and the information was not being passed on to other departments. Believe me, there are copious reports around which give the information that is required. So it did seem to me that, in terms of public housing, there was very little effort being made to translate the benefits from good design and good planning into the actual program.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1562">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly a lot of statements have been made about public housing. The last major Industry Commission report on public housing&mdash;of course, the Industry Commission is not necessarily known to be a body which has jumped on the bandwagon of welfare spending per se; generally they write reports which tend to favour their version of economic management and tend to favour large business&mdash;indicated that it was a very effective public spending program and deserved increased support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of the reasons why this is effective have been given today. For example, it is important to give some access and equity considerations to the poorest in our society, to those who have very little choice left when we make decisions which impact, say, on the cost of petroleum. Those decisions impact on people who are being shoved out to the far suburbs and who have no other way of getting into shopping areas or places of employment except in a motor car. Basically we have to take those considerations into account when we design our cities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Western Australia pensioners are being moved out of prime areas like East Perth or North Fremantle. They are being sent to outer areas and those prime lands are being developed for the rich. Doing that seems to forget equity and access altogether and imposes these social costs onto the people who can least afford them. You cannot really do that. In my opinion you should not be doing that unless you already have a good public transport system, unless those people have access to the normal things they need in life&mdash;the ability to go to the shops, the ability to live a normal life, to access schools and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is important that we take all of these issues into consideration when we are dealing with the issue of public housing. I reiterate the fact that I will be requesting at the end of this second reading contribution that, having had since all of Wednesday to look at the implications of this bill, it would be fair if we adjourned this portion of the debate so that we can carefully look at this important issue in the committee stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senator KEMP</EMPHASIS> (Victoria&mdash;Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> (2.49 p.m.)&mdash;in reply&mdash;I thank senators for their contributions to and their remarks on the Housing Assistance Bill, which is a very important bill. It demonstrates the government's commitment to the Commonwealth-state housing agreement&mdash;a vital part of national housing policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill enables the Commonwealth to enter into a new CSHA for up to three years from 1 July 1996. It also appropriates funding of $1,068 million for grants to the states for housing in 1996-97. The new CSHA will continue to target and meet the needs of people who are most at risk of housing related poverty. It will also provide a basis for significant longer term reform to further improve the efficiency and effectiveness of government housing assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Faulkner suggested in his remarks that the interim agreement will operate for only one year and the states will have only one year to complete the transition to longer term housing arrangements. I am advised that this is not the case. As noted in the second reading speech, the new CSHA will operate for up to three years from 1996-97 and will form the basis for implementing longer term reform directions. Arrangements for transition to longer term reforms will naturally form part of the ongoing negotiations with the states. The bill appropriates funding for one year. This is consistent with the negotiating process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Dee Margetts requested that we adjourn the debate at this stage. It is certainly my strong preference that we continue to the committee stage. I understand that the bill was introduced into the house almost three weeks ago, on 8 May. There has been time for people to consider the bill. As has been noted by a number of speakers, it is substantially the same as the bill introduced in 1995 by the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Funding runs out on 30 June 1996. It is critical that this bill, which provides for funding beyond 30 June, be passed before 30 June. We have a very heavy program. As I have said, the bill has now been in the public arena for some three weeks. I ask the senator to check whether the amendments she wishes to move are available and can be distributed, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1563"> but it is my strong preference that we now move to the committee stage and consider any amendments that senators wish to move.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a lot of history in this bill&mdash;a very interesting mix of history. We have a coalition government presenting a bill drafted by a Labor government to abolish a highly successful statutory authority set up by a previous coalition government. It makes one wonder where the consistent public policy might be in this bill other than in its history.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Housing Loans Insurance Commission was established 31 years ago when Robert Menzies was Prime Minister. It was established by a conservative government which identified a serious hole in the housing finance markets and decided that it was a good idea for the government to do something to fix it. That was back in the days when governments believed they had a role in people's lives. Robert Menzies' government believed that in the case of market failure the public sector should get in and fix it. But these days those kinds of actions appear quaint and unusual.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After 13 years of financial deregulation, our financial sector is still riddled with market failures, but we do not see Prime Minister John Howard saying, `I'll do a Menzies, my hero. I'll set out to fix this.' I think also these days both the Treasurer, Peter Costello, and the Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1564"> would probably cut their tongues out before they would follow the Menzies model and say that the government should set up its own financial corporation to assist low income earners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact of the matter is: our financial sector is not functioning as a fully competitive, consumer friendly market. That is really quite clear. Fees are excessive and interest rates faced by housing and small business customers are still much higher than those faced by big business. There is no entirely effective consumer watchdog or arbiter of complaints. We have a banking code of practice, but it is one you could drive an armoured van through. Anyone who gets up and says these days, in 1996, that the government has a role in fixing it because the market is not actually working gets burned at the stake as a heretic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Housing Loans Insurance Corporation was formed in 1965 to insure home lenders against losses secured by mortgages, principally housing loans. It was also specifically tasked with increasing home loan affordability for low and middle income earners who at the time faced expensive second mortgages to obtain loans with low deposits. It was the first insurer of its time and it proved to be very profitable. It is now basically self-financing and its repayments to the Commonwealth through dividends, special payments and taxation amount to $146 million&mdash;significantly more than the original capital injection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last two years have been very successful ones for the HLIC with 94,700 loans insured in 1994 and another 84,000 loans insured in 1995. Gross profits were $24.8 million in 1994 and $21.3 million in 1995 with $15 million in tax and $15.4 million in dividends being paid to the government. Despite the entry of other loan insurers into the market, the HLIC still insures about half of the loans insured in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will corporatise the HLIC, moving the assets to a new company, HLIC Ltd. This new company will lose some of the competitive advantages and all of the public sector obligations of the current HLIC. It will <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> compete in the market in a purely commercial manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the government is a little more certain of the value of the company in a purely commercial market, we know that it is going to be sold for about $100 million. With that sale will once again go the potential of the government to have further influence on failures in the financial markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats oppose this bill. We oppose it because we believe the HLIC still has a significant public purpose to undertake. We oppose it because we do not accept that governments no longer have a role in dealing with market failure in the financial markets. We oppose it because we are not persuaded that the public sector will be better off selling the company and retiring debt than keeping the company and the profit stream. I am not even persuaded that the housing loans insurance market is fully competitive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How does it work? Banks choose the insurer, but the housing customer pays the premium. The consumer does not even know whether the premium they are paying is the lowest possible one, because they are not allowed to shop around for it. The Democrats would prefer to see the scope of the HLIC expanded to deal with other financial market failures. The key market failure is the pricing of small business finance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> I have said this before, and I would like to say it again: financial deregulation has so far largely failed to deliver any benefits to the small business community. The Reserve Bank estimates that small business loans are let at rates three to four per cent higher than big business loans. Small business operators complain, with some justification, that these premiums are unreasonable given the level of risk. They are particularly unreasonable given that virtually all banks insist on security for small business loans&mdash;usually the family home&mdash;and will not lend on the basis of cash flow. The Democrats have, for some time, supported the establishment of a loans insurance scheme for small business loans, particularly for small businesses with a bit of a commercial track record, which are not seeking to expand. This is something sensible and practical which the government could <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1565"> introduce to fix a major problem in our <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> financial markets affecting their major con stituency. Yet last year the coalition supported the sale of the Commonwealth Development Bank, which could have provided such a service. Today what are we doing? We are setting in train the sale of the HLIC, which also could have done this. Our proposal is similar to the proposals put forward by the New South Wales Chamber of Manufactures and by small business banking expert Anna Borzi for such a scheme. The very experience of the HLIC and of the Export Finance Insurance Commission shows that such schemes can work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The market has not filled this gap. It will not fill this gap. I think that if Robert Menzies were alive today, he would be in there like a shot&mdash;like a true Liberal. It is a pity that his inheritors did not inherit a more liberal view of the role of government and the role of markets. </PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on behalf of the opposition to support the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation (Transfer of Assets and Abolition) Bill. The bill is virtually identical to that presented by us when we were in government and passed by the House on 24 October. The bill lapsed in the Senate due to the election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Kernot has made a number of critical points, but I would like to draw to the attention of the Senate, and others who are listening, that the market has changed considerably since this corporation was established over 30 years ago. Since that time, other insurers have entered the mortgage insurance market, thereby reducing the necessity to maintain the corporation in public ownership. Senator Kernot has outlined a range of background material that, for the purposes of saving time, I am not going to repeat. I am sure Senator Gibson will refer to some of those matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Housing Loans Insurance Corporation was exempt from supervision by the industry regulator, the Insurance and Superannuation Commission&mdash;the ISC. Consequently, it did not have to comply with the capital adequacy arrangements applying to its competitors. To <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> overcome a range of problems, the former government decided to abandon the privatisation option, but to restructure the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation. The corporation was re&hyphen;established as a company, incorporated under the companies law and subject to the regulatory requirements of the ISC, as well as those of the states and territories. The new company is fully capitalised in line with the requirements of the ISC, drawing on part of the present capital and reserves. The Commonwealth guarantee on borrowings for the new company will be removed; however, transitional arrangements will be implemented to allay uncertainty arising from the restructuring and to ensure the new company attains the appropriate credit rating required by state legislation without the need for further capital injections.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These arrangements will considerably improve the competitive neutrality of the mortgage insurance market, continuing the strong record of the former government in terms of achievements in the competition policy area. The transfer of the staff of the corporation to the new company will be achieved with the maintenance of existing conditions and entitlements such as leave, superannuation and workers compensation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill represents good policy which simultaneously improves the competitive neutrality in the mortgage insurance market, improves Commonwealth finances by around $100 million and maintains the conditions and entitlements of the staff thereby guaranteeing industrial harmony during the restructuring process but lessening the contingent liabilities of the Commonwealth into the future. This represents another example of the good economic management of the former government. This bill is supported by the opposition in the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We supported this proposal when it was raised by opposition when it was in government. Corporatisation of the HLIC is a good idea. There is no reason why it should not be operating as a fully commercial entity in a competitive marketplace. It is also important to note that the success of the HLIC <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1566"> over many years has helped to create  a very competitive housing loan market in Australia. Consumers today are getting the benefits from that competitive market.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The securitisation of home mortgages and the cutting of interest rates has allowed the entry of new suppliers of home loans into the Australian market. Home buyers and people refinancing their homes have received definite benefits as a consequence. Securitisation of that industry could not have taken place without the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation's background of insuring mortgages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">New entrants into the housing loan industry insist that their mortgages be insured with the HLIC or another entity. Given the great benefit for all consumers in the housing market, there is absolutely no reason why the HLIC should remain tightly within the government's hold. The HLIC should be corporatised. Senator Sherry outlined the principle benefits of this proposal. It will become, under the Corporations Law, a corporatised entity at arms length from government and the government welcomes this move.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Federal Police Amendment Bill 1996, which is before the Senate, deals primarily with the powers accorded the Commissioner of the AFP in relation to dismissing staff and members of the AFP. The powers being proposed go well beyond the present powers and have the potential to make significant changes to the job security of members of the AFP.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We contacted the AFP Police Association and were somewhat surprised to hear that the association supports the measures in the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main provisions of the Bill concern removing the impediment to the Commissioner's power to remove an officer or staff member in cases of misconduct. Honourable Senators would be aware <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1569"> that, at present, the Commissioner must instigate internal disciplinary measures to remove someone from the AFP, even if that person has been convicted of a criminal offence by a court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If that was the only impediment being removed, I could be happy with the change. However, the Bill, in Item 6 (new s26F) takes a further step which I cannot support, namely that the Commissioner will be able to remove from the AFP someone whom he or she believes is engaged in serious misconduct, whether or not charges have been laid, much less on the basis of a conviction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill then takes this power to remove a person from the AFP one step further still, in the form of excluding a person removed under s26F from taking action for wrongful dismissal under the Industrial Relations Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No doubt the government will argue that this leaves the person the option of taking action under the Administrative Decisions Judicial Review Act or under common law. However, as senators would know, taking such a step is a vastly different, more complex and potentially more costly proposition than taking a wrongful dismissal matter through the Industrial Relations processes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Furthermore, an action taken under the ADJR Act cannot only be on points of law&mdash;it can only be a review of whether due process took place in relation to the dismissal. It cannot be a review of the merits of the case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is why I was surprised that the AFP Police Association was supportive of the Bill&mdash;it significantly weakens the rights of members and staff of the AFP under certain circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of course, these measures have been promoted on the basis of their usefulness in the fight against corruption&mdash;a laudable aim. However, even in matters of corruption, we dare not infringe on peoples' rights.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It seems to me that this issue involves the larger matter of accountability, and I want to say a few words about that.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`Accountability' has become something of a mantra in recent years, but the use of the word is all one way&mdash;accountability upwards, to the funding providers. We see this particularly in areas such as Aboriginal affairs, community sector organisations, health providers, aged care providers and the like. That is, those who are provided with government money have to record, report, account, and so on, for every cent and the way it is used. Woe betide the organisation that spends money for pens and pencils!!</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But there is more to accountability. Accountability is also owed to those who are the recipients of services. It is owed to those who are employed. This is an accountability of service, an accounta <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> bility about how an organisation performs its services and meets its commitments to clients and staff.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Staff are not simply a tool placed somewhere between the source of funds and the end point of the service. They are an integral part of an organisation and the organisation has as much a duty of accountability to them as to clients, (however they may be defined) and to those who provide the funds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am sure it is easy for the government, any government, to `sell' the idea of a crack down on corruption. Of course corruption should be fought wherever and whenever it occurs. But a society which claims to abide by the rule of law cannot simply sweep aside the rights of people, any people, under the rubric of fighting corruption or the mantra of accountability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill in its present form is insupportable. I will be putting amendments to the Senate in Committee in the hope of restoring what I regard as the fundamental rights of staff members and members of the AFP.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Specifically, those amendments would allow the Commissioner to remove from the AFP someone convicted of a criminal offence under the relevant regulations, but not someone who may be charged, or has been charged but not yet convicted. That would still leave the Commissioner the power to instigate internal disciplinary action.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I trust that there are sufficient senators who hold to the notion that people are innocent until proven guilty to gain support for my amendments.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the opposition, I rise to indicate that we will not be opposing the Customs Tariff (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 1996. This is another one of those bills that the previous government, of which I was a part, had already prepared and submitted. I must say that, if the new government had not had in the pipeline such a list of bills which already had been prepared and submitted by us, its legislative program for this session would have been extremely brief indeed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Nevertheless, we support this bill. It carries through a period for the classification of changes for the harmonisation of commodity descriptions and coding systems of the World Customs Organisation. This is in connection with the process of moving to the new arrangements under the World Trade Organisation on customs descriptions for all those commodities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have risen to speak because the second reading speech, which refers to the provisions of the Customs Tariff Act, points out that these instruments include approximately 22,000 tariff concession orders and commercial tariff concession orders, 800 tariff concession order applications, 1,000 determinations in relation to the passage of the motor vehicle plan and 300 by-laws. This is very much&mdash;as we would say in the Australian vernacular&mdash;the `guts' of the tariff system and its operation by the Australian Customs Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The point I raise is that, at the time this very important bill is going through as part of the international process, we are also seeing announcements by the new government of substantial reductions in the resources avail able to Customs. The new government, on coming to office, announced that it would cut $50 million off the customs department&mdash;and overwhelmingly in the staffing area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Already it has been publicly acknowledged that 300 or 400 jobs in Customs will go. I notice that, disproportionately, many of them will go from the outlying states. My own state of South Australia, for example, will be losing 16 per cent of its Customs staff; Tasmania will be losing over 40 per cent. This is from a new government that said it would be looking after the interests of rural and regional Australia. However, the biggest cuts are falling in the smallest states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But also, in carrying out these cuts, it mentions in the public document circulated by Customs itself that this would have an impact on the information technology and computer programming area of Customs. The position on which I would ask the minister whether he can give any information is: will the cutbacks that are taking place in Customs affect the processing operations of Customs itself to handle all the new classifications, the new processes that have been outlined in this bill?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be tragic indeed if, after achieving these new harmonisation rules across the world, through the World Customs Organisation and the World Trade Organisation, Australian Customs was not able to make full use and provide that information to Australian industry. Looking at those numbers I read out as having been acknowledged in the second reading speech, tariff concession orders alone amount to some 22,000. I point out that the new government has changed its election campaign decision to abolish tariff concession orders. It will continue the tariff concession order system but operate it at three per cent rather than five per cent and also put in a whole new level of items to be described as `consumer items'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a question on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> asking for the full list of `consumer items' that will now get a three per cent tariff tax. In the past they did not; they received a tariff concession order. But they will now get an extra three per cent tax. There is no doubt that the cost to Customs to be able to run this new tariff concession system properly at three <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1571"> per cent, with all the `consumer items' being added to it, will be extra resources, particularly in the area of computer systems and information technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to raise that point again with the minister. Can he assure us that the $50 million reduction to resources, staff and information technology will not make it more difficult for Customs to operate in this area? This is a very important issue for Australian industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has often been said to us in the past that the coalition, whether in government or opposition, is more sympathetic to, and understanding of, the business community. We in the Australian Labor Party have always refuted that. We have said that, on a practical basis, we have a better understanding of the needs of industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new government's announcements about the cutbacks to Customs indicate to us that they do not understand the interests of business and industry. If we are going to be an internationally competitive economy, exporting to and importing from the world marketplace and, in particular, the Asia-Pacific region, we need a Customs Service that is able to efficiently and quickly provide to industry by information technology what the tariff levels are. It cannot operate by the old system where Customs brokers lodged, in a very complicated way, documents in post boxes at every Customs office around Australia. It has to be done electronically.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australian Customs Service was leading the world in the introduction of information technology. For example, last year Customs was given great credit&mdash;it should be given to them very strongly&mdash;for putting on CD&hyphen;ROM information about the tariff levels on every item from every APEC country. No matter where you were in an APEC economy, for a small cost you could obtain that CD&hyphen;ROM and find out what the tariff level was for an item in Chile, the United States of America, Mexico, Thailand or Hong Kong. This was a very efficient way of providing information to industry right across APEC and removing some of the barriers that inhibit the growth of trade.  </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Customs in Australia has to be given great credit for being the leader, out of all the APEC countries, of this process over recent years. It is one of the leaders in the World Customs Organisation. It is very strange that one of the government's first actions was to reduce the ability of Customs to provide that service to Australian industry. The cutbacks to Customs mean that it may not be able to effectively achieve for industry the harmonisation of information on all these items under the new process that has been agreed to. I hope that I am wrong, but I suspect that I am not. That is my warning to the government. I hope that they can take that on board. I would certainly appreciate the minister responding to this and giving us some information.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to take this opportunity to speak about a petition which I was able to lodge with the Senate for over 17,000 people from New South Wales. I think honourable senators would appreciate that 17,000 people on one petition is an extraordinary number of people. In fact it took some time for me to lodge it because, first of all, it took a long time to count up the number of names and, secondly, it was not in the proper form. Unfortunately, I had to lodge the petition after the subject of the petition had already been reported on by the Senate, and I want to take the opportunity now to speak briefly about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The petition was made by petitioners from New South Wales who were concerned about the tobacco inquiry by the Senate community affairs committee. It was from small business people who were concerned by a recommendation made by that committee that the government, or governments, should consider ways in which the sale of cigarettes could be limited to people under the age of 18 and, in particular, whether or not there should be some restriction to licensed premises for the sale of cigarettes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> To give the Senate some background on this issue, the reason why I became involved is that the Philip Morris company wrote to everyone who sells cigarettes in New South Wales and implied&mdash;I think anyone reading their letter would have made this a reasonable implication&mdash;that I was in some way in favour of this proposal. They gave my name and address as the person to contact if people were somehow aggrieved by this and wished to register their complaint.</PARA>

Had they bothered to contact me prior to sending <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that letter out and using my name in that way, they would have found out that I had every intention of supporting the very thing that they were advocating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I became aware of this letter&mdash;and I became aware of it because of the hundreds of people who contacted my office&mdash;I rang Philip Morris and I asked, ` Can I have the list of the people you have sent this letter to so that I, too, can write to them and say that I agree with everything that you want to achieve from your letter. I want to write to those people to say that I will support their case in the Senate.' They refused to give me any names and addresses of the people they had sent it to. The only recourse I had was to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yellow Pages</EMPHASIS> business list. I was in the position where I had to write to every pizza joint, every petrol retailer, every newsagent&mdash;every small business in New South Wales&mdash;which sold cigarettes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the response that I got to the petition which I enclosed in my letter would indicate to senators that there is a very strong feeling out there in the community, not just from small business people but from their customers, that any move to restrict the sale of cigarettes by targeting small businesses&mdash;such as newsagents, petrol stations and corner milk bars&mdash;is a very unfair way of achieving the very laudable aim which the committee was trying to achieve. It is another example of how small business can be made the victim when somebody wants to achieve some greater purpose in society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem with the contention&mdash;I am not saying that the committee wanted to do this&mdash;that you should restrict the sale of cigarettes only to licensed premises or only to registered tobacconists is that small businesses, the corner shops, are not in a position where they can go to the expense of getting a special licence, nor can they generate the volume to justify it, whereas big business&mdash;major supermarkets and others&mdash;can quite easily afford that. The upshot of that proposition would be that the beneficiaries would be big business, and small business would suffer. Also, I do not think this would be any great advancement to the reduction of smoking by people under the age of 18.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1573">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it was a very ill-advised route that the committee decided to go down. But the committee certainly did not make any strong recommendation in this regard. The committee was well aware that the powers in this area do not lie with the Commonwealth government anyway; it is entirely a matter for the states to regulate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To target the Senate and me, in particular&mdash;and I was not the only one; I think other honourable senators were targeted in other states&mdash;was a very devious thing for the Philip Morris company to do. It was certainly very unfair. But having representations from some 17,000 people&mdash;and it would be at least that because many other sheets of papers came in which we could not submit to the Senate&mdash;indicates the strength of feeling that small business people have, and I think it is very easy to see why.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sorts of small businesses that I am talking about operate as convenience stores. They sell cigarettes because people drop in for cigarettes and buy other things such as milk, bread, newspapers, petrol and so on. These small businesses make their living as convenience stores. They work extraordinarily long hours because, only by working those hours, can they provide a service for people which is not otherwise available. They can truly claim to be some of the hardest working people in business in the Australian economy. The very fact that the nature of their work requires them to be at their place of work for as long as it does, and at all of the times when other Australians are out enjoying themselves, indicates just how dedicated to their business they are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was very pleased to present that petition. I very strongly believe that, where people want to serve a greater good in the community, then they should be sensitive to the effects that that will have. All of the people who signed that petition also said that they were strongly opposed to under 18&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds smoking and to the sale of cigarettes to people under the age of 18.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of those small business people would be more than happy to support any move which did something about that particular problem. The fact that they were opposed to this <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> particular recommendation and this particular measure should not be taken as some indication that they were either indifferent to the question of smoking by people under the age of 18 or that they somehow advocated it. I think that would be an unfair and wrong inference to make.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, this is my opportunity to bring the concerns of those 17,000&hyphen;odd petitioners to the Senate. I hope that in future the Senate will take those thoughts into account.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(3.53 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to comment on a recently tabled report from the Higher Education Council entitled `<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Equality, diversity and excellence: Advancing the national higher education equity framework</EMPHASIS> '. This is an excellent report which evaluates the success of the higher education system in meeting the original equity objectives set out in the white paper of 1988. It provides advice on a policy framework to meet those equity objectives in the next five years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition government should be making policy through evaluation and assessment of previous policy, and setting the goals which we want to reach in the higher education sector. However, what the government is doing now is in complete opposition to good practice in policy making. It is illogical. It does not look at the goals of the higher education sector. Instead, the approach is to slash and burn and to take any initiative which will push the higher education sector into private hands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The policy goal of equity is absolutely intrinsic to Australia's universal right under citizenship to quality education. We need to look after our disadvantaged groups such as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, women, people from non-English speaking backgrounds, people with disabilities, rural and isolated students, and people from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report has found that, under the Dawkins model of mass education, the mass education approach has alleviated problems of access for some groups, at least numerically; namely, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1574"> students, students from non-English speaking backgrounds and women in lower level courses. This success can be directly associated with special programs introduced during the last five years by the groups which have made them more flexible in their teaching assessments, admission requirements, support services and access programs, and which have gone some way to remove access barriers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two major groups which have not been greatly assisted by these mechanisms in the areas of success and retention in higher education, and these are indigenous and isolated students. Also, the most underrepresented groups at universities are, again, isolated students and students from low socioeconomic backgrounds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report advocates more complex solutions to these problems which go to the heart of organisational culture and structures. Some of these recommendations include the prioritisation of equity in management structures, in corporate policies and in evaluating progress towards equity. Also important is effective understanding of the profile of the student body and a student centred approach to teaching and flexibility in practice to meet different student needs. Of course, these changes are not enough without additional funding of approximately $4 million for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander, isolated and disabled students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government must urgently heed the knowledge of this document. Their slash and burn cuts will destroy the present equity gains in the sector and destroy the formation of a future equity program which looks at the deeper structural reasons for inequity. This is what the higher education sector must now turn its attention to to address.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report rightly claims that inequality of representation in education is the result of multiple social, educational and economic factors, which are not due to different overall levels of ability. Yet the government is pursuing a path of decreasing student numbers, concentrating research and curriculum strengths in certain universities and not others under the double&hyphen;speak term of `diversity', which actually reduces it.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is embarking on a program of fees for all postgraduate students and substantially increasing HECS rates and possible undergraduate fees. These will hit the poorest students the hardest. This socioeconomically disadvantaged group is already the most underrepresented group in the university system along with isolated students. Again we will see the return to the pre-Whitlam days of education for the privileged, and access and equity will go out the window. Then no amount of support services or changed management practices will help because the primary barriers will be financial. The Liberal's solution will be scholarships, but these only help the brightest of the poor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As this report points out, the ability to succeed at university is less about intelligence, some sense of innate ability or potential, and more to do with economic, social, educational and circumstantial factors. The Greens believe the coalition government's proposed changes to higher education go to the heart of preserving these structural inequalities and therefore perpetuate inequality of access and participation at university. The fact that programs which have worked on increasing the participation rate of some sectors of the community which traditionally have been underrepresented in the university sector are having success is not&mdash;and I stress the word not&mdash;a reason to remove them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know of a case where we had groups of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander tertiary students visiting us, and they indicated that they certainly have a participation rate which is increasing. It has taken a long time to get that increase in the participation rate, but to have the retention rate for students to get through the courses will take a lot more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also a lot of catching up to do. Let's face it. If what we are seeing is more confident and older people, for instance, in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities now coming to achieve their potential so that they can work in their communities. It makes absolutely no sense whatsoever to cut out the special support programs so that the younger people in the community will not be able to follow on. If anybody thinks that those support services are not required, they <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1575"> have not talked to the groups involved and they have no understanding of the issues involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Greens would like to see this significant and insightful report's recommendations taken up by the government. Some of these important recommendations include separate equity planning responses to each of the different disadvantaged groups, putting student profiles to the equity test, changing the basis of institutional equity plans, performance based equity funding, and priority initiatives for socioeconomically disadvantaged and isolated students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If these recommendations are to work, it must be in a context in which the government preserves the current gains in equity made for women, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students and students from non-English speaking backgrounds. If not, then equity will take a backward step and Australia will progress faster to a higher education system for the privileged.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was Bill Hayden, now a grazier&mdash;not like you but perhaps like Senator Brownhill&mdash;up in Queensland. One thing about the Governor-General's speech, and I am going to be serious for a moment, was that I was surprised he made some comments about the atrocities that had occurred at Port Arthur just a few days previously and that those well&hyphen;meaning comments were not contained in the official speech. I do not know why that was. Certainly the comments reflected the views of all Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since then there have been a number of initiatives by the Prime Minister, Mr Howard.

Hopefully those bills will get through the parliament with speedy passage with the support of every parliamentarian in this place. I believe that will be for the good of our society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would hope, though, that that is only a start. I want to get back to a theme I have raised in this place before: the removal of guns from our society per se; remove them all. Our police could also take the initiative. I know that in the police force in my state, Western Australia, police can make the choice as to whether or not they wear guns. The majority, unfortunately, choose to wear them. I do not think there is a call for that in Australian society or in Western Australian society.</PARA>

I am not saying to remove all guns from the police. But I am saying that I do not see the need for a policeman on traffic patrol duty&mdash;doing what they are employed to do it would seem; collecting revenue from speeding motorists, rather than doing the more important things&mdash;to have a gun strapped to their hip. I really do not see the need for that. Perhaps the various state authorities can use the revenue saved for other purposes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now take this opportunity to congratulate the government on their election. This is the first opportunity I have had to congratulate them. It was a victory which nobody can walk away from. I must say that it was more comfortable sitting on the benches opposite than it is sitting over here, although today I got some delight from watching some of the antics in the performances by people on the opposite side when they were trying to responsibly get legislation passed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I noted that Senator Hill took up my interjection about offering the resignation of Senator Kemp to see whether that could speed up the passage of legislation. He unfortunately did not pick up my interjection about offering Senator Panizza's head as well. I am certain that, had he done that, our Green colleagues would have picked up the offer and we would have moved on and allowed the bills to pass.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The election was a very strong victory for the Liberal Party. It was not a victory for the National Party in Western Australia, but it certainly was a victory for the Liberal Party right throughout Australia. But it was not a complete rout.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In light of foreshadowed cuts to all levels of education, the report of the Bureau of Industry Economics on the future of the multifunction polis makes very interesting reading. It recommends that further funding <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to the MFP site be terminated. Perhaps this offers us one way of ameliorating to some degree the plight that higher education and research institutions are in at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The MFP was hatched in 1987 by the Japanese government with the assistance of former Senator Button. The previous Labor government had cut funding to universities and to research institutes such as the CSIRO, and yet vigorously promoted the fairyland idea of a multifunction polis as a leader in the development of international science and technology. From the very beginning, this proposal came under trenchant criticism from the Australian Democrats and a number of key academics. One of the principal grounds for this criticism was that the MFP was taking resources that should have been spent on both basic and applied research within Australian universities and research institutes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From the beginning, the MFP was a fairyland, and any suggestion to this effect to government ministers at the time by the Australian Democrats was met with derision. The former government maintained at the beginning that no government funding would be spent on the multifunction polis; it was to be privately driven. But, for nine years, both the federal and the South Australian governments have poured money into what can only be described as a face&hyphen;saving exercise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the early years, the federal government maintained that the MFP would be the largest development ever undertaken in this country and that, by concentrating resources into the MFP, this facility would lead Australian industry and the Australian economy out of the valley of desolation and destruction that the government had taken it into. At this time, I might add, many opposition senators thought that the MFP was a mirage. Unfortunately, they did not support attempts by my predecessor, Senator John Coulter, when he moved amendments in appropriation debates in November 1991 that the roughly $4 million allocated by the government in that budget to the MFP be removed. His motion was not supported by the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In its original MFP concept document, the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry included a proposal to build a 2.1 <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1578"> kilometre high mountain with a runway for launching linear rocket vehicles into orbit. Both federal and state governments&mdash;the South Australian government&mdash;have spent considerable sums trying to convince the public that the always ill&hyphen;defined MFP was a profitable and productive way to spend the public's taxes. It held expensive conferences costing $1,000 for two days. The Bannon government spent $150,000 on a public relations firm to convince South Australians and other taxpayers and more recently retained a chief executive at $370,000 a year salary and bonuses, all as part of the promotional tour for the MFP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is really remarkable how unwilling governments, politicians and many bureaucrats are to admit that they have made a mistake and how a lot of this public money has in fact been spent defending the indefensible. Nor has the practice stopped. In the last few years, two projects have been promoted as achievements of the multifunction polis&mdash;the cleaning up of the polluted Gillman site and the building of a group of energy efficient and novel energy technology&hyphen;using houses at Northaven. They have been claimed to be successes; in fact, the former was a success but it did not need the expensive backing of the MFP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Several university departments, together with soil engineers and a few earthmovers would have had the same effect more cheaply. As to the two houses at Northaven, it is clear that these continue the practice of public window dressing and not a serious attempt to address the urgent need to develop more energy efficient housing for Australian conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, the houses were not built by the MFP, but by a private builder. Not one has eaves to protect the walls from heat gain or loss, and solar water heating is absent. One house has a geothermal heating and cooling system, that is, one that circulates water through a pipe deep underground and, inside the house, uses this constant temperature water as a heat sink for a reverse cycle refrigeration system to heat and cool the house. I will explain that later, Senator Panizza, if you wish.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This system is unusual in Australia and may not hold promise of more energy and cost efficient housing. To find out, it would be necessary to monitor for over a year or more every aspect of the energetics and economics of the system. But no monitoring equipment has been fitted into this unit. It is window&hyphen;dressing for the uninformed and uninitiated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, in the forthcoming year it is expected that the federal government will spend some $4 million on the MFP and the state government will spend about $24 million. In light of the report by the Bureau of Industry Economics recommending that funding to the MFP should be terminated, and in light of the failure of the MFP to deliver any of its promised benefits, it is time for the government to recognise the mistakes that have been made, by its predecessor admittedly, and to divert any funding which might otherwise have gone to the MFP to our universities and </PARA>
