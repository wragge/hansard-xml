<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>In dealing with the particular issue before us, I have to say that it is one of the most difficult and certainly one of the most contentious issues that I have been involved in in terms of the inquiry process in this place. I would like to put on public record my appreciation, and I am sure the committee's appreciation, to the various people involved&mdash;the members of the committee, the secretariat, the witnesses and a whole range of people&mdash;for the cooperation they have shown. I also make the point that the report that has been brought down is a unanimous report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will deal with some of the issues, realising that we are now dealing with a different situation from that of a year or two ago as far as the importation of foodstuffs into this country and the quarantine requirements are concerned. This comes under the auspices of the previous government. When the Uruguay Round outcomes were finalised, we did move <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4839"> into a different trading situation and different arrangements in relation to Australia's role in foodstuff imports into this country and how quarantine matters or non&hyphen;tariff barrier matters should be handled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first recommendation which we deal with in this particular report is that we believe in this new trading environment that governments in this country should now, in fact, develop or operate under a whole of government process. Therefore, our first recommendation is that the Quarantine Act be amended so that the final decision in terms of the import of foodstuffs into this country is on a recommendation from the director of quarantine to the minister and/or government, whichever is appropriate according to the circumstances. As I said, this would involve a whole of government approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We mention the position of the director of quarantine, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Trade and their particular role under these new world trading arrangements. That relates back to the Uruguay Round outcomes. Although not specifically mentioned in this recommendation, it would also involve the Minister for the Environment with regard to the environmental implications that could flow on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This particular application as far as chicken meat is concerned dates back to about 1985, so it has been around a long time, with particular emphasis from about 1991. I make the point&mdash;and the committee acknowledges this in the report&mdash;that we are not scientists but, nonetheless, in view of the evidence that was put before us, we believe that the heat thermal treatment has never been tested on chicken meat as far as we can find out. In regard to this, we have had information, particularly from Dr Alexander, which was tabled before the committee. We have recommended that AQIS commission tests of the thermal inactivation of Newcastle disease virus and infectious bursal disease virus in chicken meat products under commercial conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also make the point that this need not necessarily delay the process of decision making, as has been claimed, providing it is dealt with immediately. As a member of the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government, I certainly strongly recommend that to the minister and to the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point that we make in terms of these recommendations, which fits neatly alongside this particular recommendation, is that there be collaboration with the industry in setting up the design of this experiment and this action so that there can be no further disputation about the validity of the science underlying these protocols. You have one group of scientists who, in effect, tell you that the scientific processes are sound and reliable and work, and you have others who tell you that, in fact, it is dangerous to extrapolate results from the particular work that has been done on egg yolk, for example, and apply it across the board to chicken meat, and that is why we have brought down this particular recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next recommendation that we deal with is that these field trials be extended to a commercial cooking environment. Once again, we were given evidence that you could have large degrees of variation of temperature in particular ovens, and we would need to be satisfied that the thermograph calibration and its performance in fact did meet the requirements that were needed as far as the process was concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We touch on the necessity for the inspection of plants, wherever they might be. There is already a commitment to go to Thailand, but I will not dwell on that in the time that I have. When it comes to the environmental consideration in terms of the likely introduction of Newcastle disease or infectious bursal disease, there is no appropriate scientific test that can be applied to detect whether or not you have these diseases in the chicken meat after it has been treated other than to feed it to the chickens to find out whether or not they die. This is a pretty thorough test, I guess. As there is no other test, we have recommended that AQIS require area certification from avian disease. The committee believes that AQIS should follow established international practice with regard to disease certification requirements. I make that point because that is practised in other countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to the committee's recommendation that the most appropriate assistance measures <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4840"> available for the government's consideration would be introduction of appropriate safeguard action to allow imposition of tariff or quota restriction on importation on a temporary and reducing basis. These were the outcomes of the Uruguay Round and the WTO negotiations.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not sure whether it is courageous or not, but I think it is proper. It seems pointless to me and the committee, when this is part of the procedure that was agreed to and which other countries are using and are prepared to use, that Australia should not use those same processes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bound tariff which would apply in Australia, which was agreed to, would amount to 13.7 per cent reducing to nine per cent by the year 2000. In addition, provision is made for the utilisation of import quotas on a reducing basis. A very technical, detailed process is involved there; nonetheless, we have recommended that the government give consideration to using those processes in relation to the import of chicken meat and, I would suggest, other products. We have also recommended an industry assistance package of limited duration similar to the citrus industry package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a lot more to this report than the points I have covered, but I will make some general comments on the whole issue of the importation of foodstuffs into this country. I hope this report does set some guidelines for how we deal with the importation of foodstuffs into Australia. It is absolutely clear from the evidence given to us that there is still confusion about the particular processes that have to be gone through as far as AQIS is concerned, despite the recommendations of the committee I worked on prior to Christmas, of which Senator Burns was the chairman. Certainly Senator Brownhill and others were on that committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> This particular aspect should be addressed to make it absolutely clear and to separate those roles with total transparency of quarantine issues, adjustment issues and environmental issues. We strongly recommend that to the government because it does create confu sion and significant mistrust between the participants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the points that was particularly brought out by this inquiry was an opinion in the general public, in this case in the chicken industry, that the stance AQIS has adopted is to formalise their position, put that position out for public comment and call that consultation. Once again, that came through very clearly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will have more to say about this matter in due course, but I think the position that has been adopted by the committee is one that is sustainable in the longer term for other imports. We want to be absolutely certain, in terms of the processes that will be put in place, that every aspect has been examined. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prior to the last election, this was a red hot issue in primary industry. A lot of people do not realise what a significant industry this is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4841"> for Australia. It employs  thousands of Australians in permanent jobs. It is, for example, the single biggest industry in the Hunter Valley in New South Wales. These are things a lot of people do not know.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question of the importation of this chicken meat had been on the agenda for a considerable period of time and the previous government and the previous minister had made absolutely no decision at all on it. That is a matter now of indisputable public record. The now minister, then the shadow minister, provided to that industry some weeks prior to the election a categorical, written undertaking&mdash;with his signature on the bottom of it&mdash;</PARA>

That is what the letter said.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only did the Nairn review have to complete its work but the recommendations of the Nairn review, which the minister at that stage could not have even contemplated let alone seen, were to be implemented in full. I thought it was an extraordinary undertaking, a stupid undertaking, to give anybody, that site unseen you would bind yourself to have a whole bunch of recommendations that you did not even know would come down implemented in full.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He backed off it when he got monstered by Senator Crane and no doubt you, Senator Boswell. I was certainly doing a bit of monstering of my own. The minister made a hash of it. Don't believe me; read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>  reports at the time. He made a total and utter mess of it and is still making a mess of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why I suggested this reference to the committee so that the committee could rescue the minister for primary industries from the mess he single&hyphen;handedly created. To add insult to injury, not only did the minister say that he would not take a decision on importing the meat until the Nairn committee had completed its work and its recommendations had been implemented in full&mdash;that is probably still at least a year away yet&mdash;but he also gave a commitment, as Senator West and Senator Woodley know, to conduct a full environmental impact statement under the EPIP act into the importation of cooked chicken meat. To fix that puzzled expression on your face, Senator Boswell, I can provide you with the letter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the minister gave two written undertakings, Senator, before you leap to your feet to defend him&mdash;one for an EIS and the other for the Nairn committee. He made a total hash of it. I give due credit to the chair of the coalition primary industry committee for the work he did to get this stupid decision reversed. The minister backed off it at 1,000 miles an hour when he got monstered by Senator Crane as well as being monstered by a few of us on this side of the house.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what angered me&mdash;and I am still angry about it&mdash;is that, having messed it up, this wimp of a minister then attempted to publicly <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4842"> put the blame on the previous government that had taken no decision whatsoever to import chicken meat. As I said publicly at the time we went out of government or prior to that, Senator McMullan, the then Minister for Trade, and I had actually completed a draft cabinet submission&mdash;it will be sitting there in the department somewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was concerned as the then minister for primary industries that in this brave post&hyphen;GATT world we must take quarantine decisions based on the science, not on the politics. The reason I make these remarks is to point to what I think is one of the most important recommendations in this report that goes way beyond chicken meat, and I am sure Senator Crane would agree. It is so important for our national interest that we handle this business properly because it is a fact, as the minister said last night on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS>, that this country exports in dollar terms five times what we import.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, it is a fact that if a quarantine decision is taken to remove a prohibition which formerly existed it has the same effect of ripping away an entire tariff law that formerly existed but with none of the consideration that a whole of government approach needs to give to it to consider what assistance that industry might need afterwards if the decision is taken to import. Senator McMullan and I engaged in discussion that lasted almost a year as to how we could appropriately redress this structural problem with our quarantine arrangements&mdash;and it does need to be fixed. The then Minister for Trade and I had agreed as to how it would be done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An important recommendation is in this report. I commend the committee and its chair on dealing with an extremely important issue, I think, very expeditiously. This was done quickly, but it was done thoroughly and the recommendations of this report have very profound implications for the quarantine regime in this country that go beyond the question of chicken meat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the recommendations I would draw to the attention of senators is the recommendation that says that in future&mdash;and this will need a legislative change&mdash;the arrangements <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> should be changed so that the decision maker at the end of the day is not simply AQIS alone. The technical decision as to whether a product should be imported to this country must remain with AQIS, but it needs to have the involvement of the minister and, in my view, the cabinet. Apparently the Prime Minister is also of this view, I am delighted to hear, at least in respect of chicken meat.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are now even, I am pleased to see, beginning to talk about an environmental impact statement. But it is well overdue to start looking at the range of issues to which Australia signed up under the Uruguay Round of GATT, now the World Trade Organisation. It is well overdue for us to now go in and look systematically at the range of agreements and do what I said we should be doing right from the beginning&mdash;that is, a social, economic and environmental impact statement of what it is we signed up for. It is time. I asked originally, and you said, `No, we don't know what we are signing. After we sign the Uruguay Round of GATT, it will be too difficult.' Well, it should not be too difficult now because the issues are falling in front of our faces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is well overdue. We are fighting for the rural industries, and it was various areas of the rural industries which came up to those inquiries at the time&mdash;the citrus industry, the egg industry and the dairy industry. What did we do as a parliament? We ignored them. We told them to go away because there would be so many benefits that they ought to be not selfish and they should let the whole thing go through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We told them the meat industry was going to benefit. We told them that wool growers were going to benefit. What situation is the meat industry in now? What situation is the wool industry in now? Who are the real beneficiaries of this proposal? Not just trade, but investment. What has happened to the control of a number of our industries. Let us look at the banana industry. What has happened there? The industry has been taken <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> over. We have a virtual monopoly of the banana industry in Australia. What has happened to the price? Has it given more varieties? No. Has it given a better price? No. What has it done? It has given control of an entire industry of production to an overseas investor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the kinds of decisions we made as a result of the way Australia approached the signing of the Uruguay Round of GATT. It is about time all these reports are beginning to come into the media. The issues go well beyond this particular issue. The issues obviously go into the salmon industry; the issues go into the ridiculous situation of how we have also signed up for the reversal of the onus of proof on intellectual property; the issues go into whether a person can do research in Australia and get their papers checked by overseas people. There are a whole lot of issues which we have not had the guts to look at in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why? Who is stopping us from looking at these issues? It is in our best interests to find out what it is we signed up for&mdash;what it is we need to do and know before we go into any further rounds of GATT; what it is we need to know before we leap into any further negotiations on APEC; what it is we need to know when Australia goes into any negotiations internationally in relation to our trade regime; and what it is we need to know about how our trade regime impacts on domestic economies in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also about time we started opening our eyes and looking at what the impacts are on the developing countries throughout the world. Every time I have in my office somebody from a developing country who comes to see me about other issues, I take the opportunity of asking them what their situation currently is with the outcomes of the Uruguay Round of GATT. They usually tell me about the newly imposed structural adjustment programs in their countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The impacts, generally, are indicating that there is a growing gap between rich and poor in those countries. I can tell you that part of the argument that was used for Australia and other countries supporting the Uruguay Round of GATT was that we ought not to be selfish <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4844"> because this would benefit developing countries. Well, it is a load of rot. Some people are benefiting in developing countries, but it tends to be the same people who are benefiting in countries like Australia, because they are the same people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we have a new deregulated trade and investment regime, some people certainly are making a lot of money. They are transferring and vertically integrating their businesses. They can manipulate rules and regulations. They can put pressure on countries, host countries&mdash;the countries to which they are operating. They can play off tax regimes. They can play off environmental regimes. They can play off tax customs regimes, and they have that power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But this is not a free market; this is a controlled market. If we have the guts and the courage, we are going to have to deal with this some time or other in Australia. Bit by bit, some of the thoughtful elements of the media are beginning to see the connections between what we have signed and what the outcomes are, and it does no good at all for us to concentrate only on AQIS unless we start looking back at the nature of the agreement which Australia has signed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If Australian negotiators do not start&mdash;and not only in relation to this specific rule&mdash;going into international fora and arguing sensibly on the basis of full information, then we will continue to see these arguments. Not only that, we will have huge motions in this chamber once again when entire fish species are being destroyed or dying or being overrun by species that come from other places. When a species moves from one environment to another, what is known from other countries about the impact does not necessarily relate to what we know in Australia because it is a different environmental situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what will we have in the future? Are we all going to come in here outraged when something actually does happen, as we did with the situation of the pilchard kill? How many times will we have to come in here before we actually start saying that the problem is not just whether or not the minister does or does not allow the importation of cooked chicken meat?</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem goes back further than that. The problem is in the way we negotiated the Uruguay Round of GATT, the naivety and the lack of proper debate within this chamber, the lack of proper debate that occurred within the community because the major economic rationalist push said, `This is going to be wonderful.' You have only to look at yesterday's balance of trade figures to see that even in dollar terms it was not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So for our own interest, for our country's interest, we have to start being honest. We now have to go back to the point of honesty, look at what we signed, look again at our negotiating stance and start to try to fix things up in the next Uruguay Round of GATT and to fix things up in negotiations on all aspects of Australia's trade relations with other countries.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not respond to Senator Margetts's remarks. I know that she is fairly passionate about world trade, but I do want to address the report that Senator Crane, as chairman of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee, has brought down. I have only had a very brief period to look at it, but I congratulate him and Senator McGauran for a report that I believe addresses the realities of the situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although I have not sat on the committee, it seems to me that it will be some time, if the government accepts this report&mdash;and I sincerely hope it does&mdash;and this recommendation is picked up, before cooked chicken meat will come into Australia. The recommendation states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that AQIS commission tests of the thermal inactivation of Newcastle disease virus and infectious bursal disease virus in chicken meat products. This study should be conducted in conditions that are as close as possible to commercial processing conditions.</PARA>
<PARA>No doubt it will take some time to have those tests carried out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make some remarks about Senator Bob Collins's contribution. When speaking, Senator Collins puts on this indignation, this bluster, this bluff, that almost convinces you <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4845"> he knows what he is talking about. I must admit&mdash;and I must apologise to the Senate&mdash;that I have been sometimes bluffed into accepting what he has said as right, but what he said today is totally unacceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He accused the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) of breaking a commitment. He then said that the minister for primary industries had made a hash of the cooked chicken meat importation. It is advisable to see what the minister did say. The minister said that no cooked chicken meat would come into Australia until the Nairn committee brought down its report. My colleague, Senator McGauran, said the Nairn committee report comes in today. I will defy anyone in this parliament to show me one piece of cooked chicken meat that has come into Australia before the Nairn committee report has come down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So Senator Collins has gone down in the first round&mdash;a complete knockout. He said that the minister had misled the parliament and had left it in a hash. The minister's commitment was, `I will not make any final decisions to allow cooked chicken meat to come into Australia until the Nairn committee report has come down.' No decision has been made and no cooked chicken meat has been imported into Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is timely to go back and assess what the real situation was. When the government changed hands, there was a decision from AQIS that cooked chicken meat be allowed to be imported. Under the act, AQIS makes the decision. The minister was given a decision that had been made by AQIS under the act and he had to respond to that decision. Senator Collins said today he was going to try to get that changed. He said he had tried to get that changed. He was the minister for two years. While I agree that government should govern, government should make decisions, ministers represent governments and they should make decisions, that was not the case when this government took over and John Anderson became the minister for primary industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At that time, the act clearly said that AQIS makes the decision and the minister implements that decision. If the former minister, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Senator Collins, wanted to change that, he had two years to do it. But, in effect, he sat on his hands and did nothing. When the baton was changed over he wanted John Anderson to break the law. That is what it amounts to. The law clearly stated that AQIS makes the decision. AQIS had made the decision, the baton changed over and now the former minister says, `You should've broken the law.' We are not in the business of breaking the law. We on this side are law-makers, not law&hyphen;breakers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I, along with Senator Crane and a number of other people, went over to see John Anderson and said, `Let's hold this up until the Nairn committee report comes down,' and he agreed to do it. Let us not just listen to Senator Collins bluster and bluff because he has carried it on far too long and no-one believes him anymore. It is like the boy who cried wolf&mdash;you can get away with it only so many times.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Collins, you have carried it out for the last time. If you wanted the law changed, you were the minister at the time, you had the responsibility to change the law, but you sat on your hands and did nothing. Then, when the baton changed over, you wanted John Anderson to break the law that you sat on for two years. That is the chicken meat saga, as it stands. John Anderson has no blame; he has honoured every commitment he made.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(10.23 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also wish to speak to the report of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee on the importation of cooked chicken meat. It is a unanimous report because the Democrats believe that, as far as it goes, it is a good report. It certainly is an advance on the situation we had some months ago where the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson), having promised certain things to the chicken meat industry before the election then, whether or not deliberately, certainly did not deliver&mdash;and that is the problem with the promises that were made. It was not just about whether or not AQIS or the minister should make the decision; it was about whether or not an environmental impact study should be done&mdash;and certainly before the election he gave the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4846"> industry a written undertaking to that effect but then, after the election, reneged on it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, this committee recommends a way in which it can be fixed up&mdash;and that is important, I think, Senator Boswell. Perhaps I should remind Senator Boswell, Senator Collins and everyone else that if there is a gap or problem, then let us admit that the problem is there and fix it up. This is the recommendation made by the committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the government amend the Quarantine Act and place final responsibility for quarantine decisions in the hands of the Minister and/or Government.</PARA>
<PARA>We can spend all day here apportioning blame and trying to decide which minister should have done it. Let us hope that the government will pick up this recommendation and, in fact, amend the act. Quite clearly, it is too serious a matter simply to be left in the hands of departmental officials. It ought to be a decision of the minister and/or the government. They should take appropriate advice from their departmental heads. But in the end, the decision should be made by the minister. I support that recommendation strongly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, having said that this is a unanimous report and that the Democrats support all of the recommendations which have been made, let me go on to say that, nevertheless, the Democrats do believe that the report needs to say other things. I realise that the government and the opposition are plugged into and wedded to the World Trade Organisation legislation which was passed in this place some time ago. The Senate will remember that the Democrats raised serious problems with that legislation. We still have serious reservations about what the World Trade Organisation does to our industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even this report, although making some very good recommendations, is still formulated within the framework of that World Trade Organisation legislation. The Democrats would say that even this report raises serious problems with that framework; that, in fact, this report quite clearly says that framework is becoming for Australian producers not a way of making free trade accessible but a prison within which many of our industries <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are languishing&mdash;and that is true of the chicken meat industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the end this report says that there should be much more stringent application of environmental controls than there has been; that there are problems with the protocols which were formulated by AQIS; and that we can see a lot of problems in the future in terms of cooked chicken meat unless we do some very serious analysis of the procedures. But in the end the question really raised by this report is whether or not we ought to important chicken meat at all. The framework within which the report is operating is the assumption that in the end World Trade Organisation legislation will compel us to allow the importation of chicken meat.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HX5">Senator WOODLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know it is the law, Senator Crane, and I am saying that that law which this Senate passed has some very serious problems. It is only a short time since it was passed and already those problems are coming home to bite us. That is why the Democrats want to say very clearly that, although we have supported this report as far as it goes, we are aware that in the end, if we are forced through the World Trade Organisation legislation to import chicken meat into this country, that will have serious repercussions for our own industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats do not accept that there is a need for us to import chicken meat at all. We have a viable industry of our own. It is successful and it operates in a very good way. It is crazy to suggest that, because of some legislation that this parliament has passed, we have to sacrifice our chicken meat industry. The committee itself recommended that, if chicken meat is imported, we will need to put in place the imposition of a tariff or quota restriction to allow the industry to adjust. What that simply means is that our own industry would then have time to get out of the road so that imported chicken meat could come into this country. That is a crazy proposition. It is one that the Democrats cannot accept, even if we passed such legislation some time ago. The Democrats certainly voted against that legislation and, as time has <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4847"> gone by, the reservations we had at that time have simply been confirmed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me commend the committee for the work it did. I attended most of the hearings but not all of them. They were very intense. There were considerable concerns raised by the Australian chicken meat industry. Those concerns, I think, remain. The Democrats cannot accept there being any need to import chicken meat into this country. At the same time we would commend the report to the Senate; in as far as it goes, it certainly is a very good report.</PARA></SPEECH>

<STATE> (Tasmania)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(10.30 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a few comments about the report of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee. One of the things it drew to our attention&mdash;I, like Senator Woodley, did not attend all the hearings&mdash;was that there is no doubt that quarantine has been used as a non&hyphen;tariff barrier in lots of countries around the world. Australia has done a lot to be seen as one of the countries that does not use it. It is very important, as highlighted in the report, that we get the process right. Senator Bob Collins alluded to this by saying: whatever we do, it has to be based on science; it has to be defensible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another matter that has concerned me is the salmon industry in Tasmania. Senators would know that I have had more than a passing interest in it. Highlighted in the risk assessment by the previous government on the salmon industry was the lack of transparency of the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the committee hearings we were told by the director of AQIS, Mr Hickey, and his adviser, Mr Gebbie, that the process has three stages. The first stage is a risk assessment by AQIS. The second stage is a technical assessment by ABARE and the involvement of an interdepartmental committee to look at the economic impact of any decisions that are made. The third stage is consultation with industry and reporting to government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is totally unsatisfactory, and I think that the chairman of the committee agrees with that. Whether it is chicken meat or salmon&mdash;whatever it is that has quarantine ramifications&mdash;it is the industry that is going <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to suffer. Industry needs to have confidence in the process and has to be consulted all the way through the process. This has not happened. It certainly did not happen in the salmon debate&mdash;they were adversely faced with a fait accompli. More knowledge by the industry of what the processes were and what the government of the day and the current government were doing certainly would have saved a hell of a lot of time and a lot of disquiet amongst the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We make that point in our report. In fact, we recommend that the government provide the parliament and the committee with a clear explanation of the assessment process at the earliest possible time. That is one of the very positive recommendations that came out of this committee. Senator Woodley has already alluded to the fact that, if chicken meat is allowed in, there has to be a process to allow the growers some leeway to adjust.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the interesting things&mdash;most senators and lay people would not realise it&mdash;is that, as far as chicken meat is concerned, we are talking about chicken meat that would be hardly recognisable as chicken meat. It is not the drumsticks, the wings and the bits with bones in them&mdash;none of those will be imported in any shape or form&mdash;but the chicken waste that is used in chicken pies and fillings. From our observations, it is an unrecognisable gluey substance that does not even look like chicken meat. That is what we are talking about&mdash;not the nice cuts that we are used to having. But that is an aside.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The attack on the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) was quite unwarranted. I have been to public venues where he has stated publicly&mdash;as far as the salmon industry is concerned, anyway; I believe that he has done the same with the chicken meat industry&mdash;that the decision will be made by the minister and, also, it will be a cabinet decision. That is wise. That is exactly what we have recommended in this report, as the chairman has said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thought that the attack by Senator Margetts was a bit rich. You would almost think that she was defending the farmers and making a case for defending rural industries. Your track record on defending farmers and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4848"> rural industries is pretty good, isn't it? You are opposed to the live sheep trade. You have done everything you can to upset private forestry. You are trying to stop pulp mills. What is your opinion on intensive animal husbandry?</PARA>

I just hope that the bipartisan agreement that was reached in this committee continues because there is no doubt that there will be other inquiries into other quarantine matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, one of the things that disturbed me was that a lot of decisions that were made by AQIS&mdash;it was highlighted in the report at the finish; I will not mention the AQIS member's name&mdash;on this particular matter were based on the opinions of some of their officers. That is not good enough. If we are going to make decisions that affect people's wellbeing and their financial future, we need to base them on more than just the opinions of some of the officers in the quarantine service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why I say that any decision made on this matter, or any other matter regarding the importation into this country of products that could destroy or help destroy our local industries, have to be based on science. The decisions will have to be very well founded before I ever have anything to do with them or even give support to any to them.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to be able to speak today on this Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee report. It is a very important report. It is going to be one of the most significant reports that a Senate committee has handed down in some considerable time. It is important in the fact that it is a bipartisan report. It deals with a very significant issue for a sector of the rural community. </PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to join with the chair and place on record my thanks to those people who have been involved in this, particularly the committee secretariat. Also, I particularly thank the chicken meat producers and the chicken growers in this country. If it had not been for their hard lobbying and their hard work, a lot of this may never have occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a significant report, because the thing that I get out of it after a quick read of some parts is the need for more research to be done. That is summed up very clearly in appendix 6, which was a letter to Mr Bob Baldwin, the member for Paterson, from Dr Alexander, the person upon whose research AQIS appears to have drawn a lot of its conclusions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dr Alexander expresses concern about some of the conclusions that are being drawn from his research&mdash;the transferring of that research from one disease to another: the transferring of an extrapolation of that research and results in relation to egg yolks across to how it will impact upon actual animals and diseases in the real world. So it is a report of major significance. As I say, further research is the key thing that keeps coming out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing that comes out in this report&mdash;and it came out in the evidence that we were given when we went to Maitland&mdash;was the work that has been done by the chicken industry itself. It is not just the producers and the chicken growers&mdash;those who feed the chickens and those who process the chickens&mdash;but the whole industry. They were there and put concerted and well&hyphen;documented scientific evidence before the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They reminded us that newcastle disease could come into this country by birds flying here. We know that birds migrate to this country. They have been migrating to this country for tens of thousands of years and, to this stage, have never introduced one of the virulent strains of newcastle disease. So I think we can place a very small possibility on that being the source of contamination. The sources of contamination, if that disease gets into this country, are likely to be through the importation of some product that is contaminated already.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4849">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very well documented in the report that there are many types of newcastle disease and infectious bursal disease. They are not sure that they actually know the precise number. They are not sure they can tell you how severe a number of these disease are. There are, in fact, a number of very mild non-virulent forms of both diseases in this country that cause no mortality and morbidity and have no impact. It is the virulent forms of the diseases, which are endemic in Thailand and in the US, that we have concerns about. They would decimate our chicken industries. Not only that, newcastle disease, if it became loose in this country, would decimate our native bird populations as well, because all birds are affected by the disease, not just chickens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The chicken industry is of vital importance to this country. In the Hunter region the chicken industry is the largest employer. It is a large employer of people living on the central coast of New South Wales, the Campbelltown area of southern Sydney and the Riverina. We cannot afford to put at risk these industries without there being some very serious scientific research done into what the likely impact of this importation of cooked chicken meat is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recommend this report to people. AQIS has said that heat control, thermal control, is the way to kill the disease. Yet there is evidence here that, for some strains of the diseases, it is not known what the impact of heat is upon the meat and the disease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to refer to table 1, which is under chapter 3 of the report. It is a summary of the results of thermal inactivation studies in the newcastle disease virus. The variation is that some of the diseases were found to be inactivated at between 50 and 55 degrees centigrade for 30 minutes. Another researcher found that four strains require 70 degrees centigrade for 40 to 50 seconds. Another lot required 60 degrees centigrade for six to seven minutes and 55 degrees centigrade for 60 to 80 minutes. Another one found that there was a 99 per cent loss of infectivity at 43.3 degrees centigrade for 75 minutes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point raised by the industry was the difficulties they had with packing the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ovens to ensure that these temperatures could be reached with the whole load being cooked for the whole time. There were also variations in the results on thermal inactivation studies on infectious bursal disease. These are all issues that require a lot more research and a lot more work. There is also work that needs to be done on the prospect of post&hyphen;cooking contamination and the prospect of contamination of packaging. It would appear from the evidence we have received that, in fact, no work has been done by AQIS on this particular issue. I think these are all shortcomings in the recommendation being made to the minister by AQIS that we allow these particular products in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An area that is of grave concern to me is the use of chemicals in overseas countries&mdash;which might happen&mdash;and they are chemicals that are not used in Australia. We have seen in recent times some concern about antibiotic resistant bacteria being able to cross species. We do not know what antibiotic use is made in other countries in the foodstuffs for chickens. So it is an issue that is of major concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would recommend this report to everybody who has an interest in this issue. I would recommend this report to anybody who is interested in the salmon importation issue and fire blight, because those are the next two issues that I see being of major concern to industries in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard a lot today, and we have had attacks from both sides, but I was concerned to see the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Anderson, on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> last night. I gained a very distinct impression from that performance of the minister that he was quite satisfied with existing scientific evidence. I hope the minister is going to read this and digest this, because this documentation provides extremely valuable evidence that he should not be satisfied with the scientific evidence to date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had promises from the then opposition, prior to the election, that they were not going to allow this to happen, that there would be more research done. In fact, in a letter to some of the chicken producers themselves, the now minister said that a coalition government would suspend the approval of all proposed <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4850"> new import protocols, including one for salmonoid  products, until such time as a scientific review has been completed and its recommendations acted on in full. Just after they came to power, he was saying that there would be a review of quarantine and nothing further would be allowed to be imported until that had been completed and its recommendations were in place. That was before the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In May, I asked the question in here of the minister's representative and was told the minister had given approval to go ahead with the importation of cooked chicken meat. This just indicates that they changed their minds so quickly it was not funny. They were prepared to leave that industry out to dry. I think the minister should be hanging his head in shame at that. He was quick to decry attempts to import grain when it would have affected his industry, but he is not quick to defend those industries that require further scientific research to be done on their products. The minister should be asked to take a very close look at this report and to act upon the findings of this and undertake a heck of a lot more research before anything further is done.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL 1996</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Income Tax Assessment Bill 1996 is the first instalment in a package of legislation which will replace Australia's main tax law, the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The existing act has grown in haphazard fashion over the past 60 years. Layer upon layer of new provisions have been added with no serious attempt to ensure either that the act remains understandable, intelligible or internally consistent. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4851"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has grown enormously in length and complexity. Over the last 13 years of the former Labor Government alone the size of the ITAA trebled from about 1100 pages to around 3300 pages. The cost of compliance with the act has grown commensurately.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not even the most expert of tax practitioners can claim to fully understand all aspects of the act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The complexity of the current act has been responsible for a significant erosion of certainty and of confidence in our taxation system, by the general taxpaying community, both individuals and companies. This is damaging to the system itself. It can also weaken the essential tax morality of otherwise honest, law abiding, responsible citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has as a high priority the objective to rewrite the tax laws to:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">reduce their length</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">reduce their complexity</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">increase their certainty and consistency</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">reduce compliance costs</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">provide a better environment for business and individual taxpayers to meet their obligations</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This priority is part of a wider commitment by the Government to attack unnecessary red tape, over regulation, complexity and uncertainly wherever it exists.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is committed to reducing the cost of doing business, to increasing national productivity and competitiveness&mdash;to adopt world best practice wherever possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The package of bills I am introducing today&mdash;of which the Income Tax Assessment Bill 1996 is the centrepiece&mdash;is a major first step in the achievement of the Government's tax law objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill is essentially the product of the Tax Law Improvement Project. In late 1993 the Joint Committee of Public Accounts recommended that the income tax law be rewritten.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It recommended setting up a broadly based Task Force to undertake the task. As a result, the previous Government in 1994 established the Tax Law Improvement Project for this purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Tax Law Improvement Project has undertaken extensive public consultation in the preparation of the bills before the House, including the release of draft bills for public comment. The Project has also been advised by a consultative committee of experts in the field of taxation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Work is well advanced in rewriting much of the remaining rules that affect how much income tax a person must pay. A discussion paper outlining a proposed structure for a rewrite of the capitals gains tax provisions has been released and an <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> exposure draft rewrite of the capital gains tax provisions is imminent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Future instalments of the new law will progressively build up the new Assessment Act. This package of bills makes a significant inroad into that work. The Government intends that this first instalment should apply from the 1997&hyphen;98 income year, subject to transitional arrangements for some measures. The practical rule changes made in it are overwhelmingly favourable to those it affects. Future rewritten instalments, essentially on an annual basis, can be expected to apply in similar fashion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government recommended that the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, which has had a long standing interest in the tax law and has kept a watching brief over this project in particular, continue to have the opportunity to complete a review it undertook of an earlier version of this legislation. The Committee considered the bill and reported on it at the commencement of the Budget sittings in August. The bill has been amended to incorporate all the Committee's recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I now turn to outline some of the specific features of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">General Features</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At a broad level, a number of strategies have been adopted to make the law easier to understand and use.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Core provisions</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most important general provisions of the law, those dealing with how much tax a person must pay, have been redrafted in simpler and clearer terms and brought together at the start of the new law. These core provisions are essential to an understanding of the income tax system. They have been expressed clearly but with minimal change to the language of central income and deduction rules in order to retain the value of established judicial precedent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Better structure</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Readers will be assisted by a more logical structure to the law. The new act will use a top down approach, starting with the core and moving on to general provisions which affect large numbers of people; then to more specialised provisions that apply to specific groups of taxpayers or to special types of tax. After that come provisions about collection and recovery of tax and then those about administrative matters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The act will finally contain a dictionary where readers will have easy reference to the meanings of defined terms and concepts used throughout the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">New numbering system</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be a new section numbering system that is simple to understand and will better cope with <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4852"> the addition of new material in future. The existing system is cumbersome, confusing and disorienting to readers. It has been a source of derision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Talking directly to readers</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The practice of addressing readers in the second person, which was introduced in the Tax Law Improvement (Substantiation) Act 1995, has been continued for areas where the law affects individual taxpayers. This engages readers much more actively and promotes understanding. It is not used, however, in provisions that apply only to impersonal entities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Reader Guides</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Important parts of the law begin with orientation material to help readers find their way to what they need to know about it. This material will have a strictly limited legal status in interpreting the new law. The text makes clear distinctions between these non&hyphen;operative guides and the operative rules.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Modern design</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill incorporates modern design techniques for clear and effective communication. It makes extensive use of:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">examples and diagrams;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">notes highlighting special features of the law; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">signposting to other parts of the law that the reader may need to go to.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Specific areas of the law rewritten</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to the core concepts, some other areas of the existing law have been rewritten and are included in the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Losses</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provisions dealing with deductions for current and prior year losses and company group loss transfers have been rewritten. This has reduced the length of the existing provisions by more than half.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unnecessarily complex and prescriptive rules have been simplified. Another feature is the bringing together of common themes such as the continuity of beneficial ownership and the same business tests of the losses provisions. Redundant provisions have been eliminated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Tracing the ownership of listed public companies</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments will provide, in the rewritten losses provisions, streamlined rules for listed public companies to establish who owns their shares. The amendments were also announced by the Assistant Treasurer in his response to the Joint Committee's report. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new rules are a major compliance cost breakthrough. They will provide more certainty and a far simpler method for establishing share ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Companies need to maintain continuity of ownership to deduct tax losses. For listed public com <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> panies, tracing through nominee companies and interposed entities to identify very large numbers of individual beneficial owners can impose a significant evidentiary burden.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are 2 features to the new rules.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, companies will now trace ownership periodically rather than on an ongoing basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, small shareholdings of less than 1 per cent that are not part of a large indirect holding will be aggregated and a notional shareholder will be taken to own that pool of shares.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Additionally, shares held by complying superannuation funds, mutual life companies; and other like entities will be taken to be the beneficial owner of those shares. This will relieve the obligation to trace beneficial ownership of these shares.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new rules, announced by the Assistant Treasurer on 22 August 1996, will apply from the 1997&hyphen;98 income year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mining</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Also rewritten are the capital expenditure write&hyphen;offs regimes for the petroleum mining, general mining and quarrying industries. This has helped reduce the size and complexity of the law and a substantial amount of duplication has been eliminated, reducing the length of the relevant provisions overall by some 70 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Buildings</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The capital expenditure write&hyphen;offs for buildings have been rewritten and, again using the various simplification techniques I have described, have allowed the length of these provisions to be halved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Substantiation</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The income tax rules for calculating car expenses and substantiating work expenses, which were rewritten and enacted last year, are also being transferred across to the new act by this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new law will operate prospectively and existing rulings and court based interpretation will not be affected where the new law re&hyphen;expresses the same ideas for clearer effect, which is mostly what the new law will do. Where a change in substance is being made to the existing law, those changes will only apply for the future. In these cases existing rulings and precedents will apply up to the time the new law begins.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The revenue impact of the new law will be mainly neutral. While most changes will have no direct impact on the revenue outcomes, some will result in minor but unquantifiable revenue costs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are two proposals that will have a measurable revenue impact.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A proposal to allow accelerated write&hyphen;off for mining expenditure incurred before July 1982 will initially be revenue positive, being $10 million and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4853"> $5 million in the first two full years respectively, but will become revenue negative in later years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A proposal to allow display homes to be written off under the special concessions for buildings will have an annual cost of $2 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the explanatory memorandum which includes a more detailed explanation of the new structure of the bill and of a number of relatively minor changes to the law itself.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, this bill provides for a number of changes to the patient contribution Australians will pay for these medicines when accessing the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The PBS has provided Australians with protection against the high cost of necessary pharmaceutical drugs for over forty years, and it is the government's intention that this Scheme will continue to provide that protection for all Australians. The PBS is without doubt a world leader in providing not only a most comprehensive range of necessary medication but also in providing these drugs at a reasonable cost to both the taxpayer and the patient. Regrettably, with the escalating costs of new medicines, it has now become necessary for the burden on the Australian taxpayer to be redistributed slightly and the user to be asked to contribute a little more towards the costs of their medication.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">To this end the government has decided, reluctantly I might add, to raise the patient charges for all persons accessing the Scheme. Concessional users, the most frequent users of the Scheme, will be asked to pay an additional 50 cents per prescription, a rise of contribution from the present $2.70, while the general users will pay $20 towards their own medication, representing a rise of $2.60 per prescription.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important to note that the "safety net" arrangements under the PBS are not changing, thus maintaining the high level of protection afforded under this Scheme. The annual concessional limit to access the safety net will remain as 52 times the patient contribution at $166.40, and the general safety net limit is to remain at $600, with a normal CPI indexation being due on 1 January 1997. Members will note that many general users of the Scheme will now reach the safety net limit quicker, using fewer prescriptions. It is important to note, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4854"> Madam President, that this program continues the government's policy of protecting families since the safety net also covers the patient's family. The Pharmaceutical Allowance for pensioners will remain at $140.40 per year and will continue to be indexed, which is sufficient to cover their copayments for 44 prescriptions. As the average user in this group has about 30 prescriptions per year the Allowance will continue to over&hyphen;compensate many pensioners. If a pensioner reaches the safety net the additional annual cost is $26. This is little more than the average price of one of the 52 prescriptions needed to reach the safety net.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It must be said that the government has maintained the very high level of protection afforded these persons by only increasing the patient contribution by 50 cents and maintaining the "safety net" protection. The rise to date in the concessional copayment represents an increase of only 1 per cent per annum while the cost of the PBS has risen by 16.5 per cent in 1995&hyphen;96 alone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"> The opportunity has been taken to amend the indexation of these charges to bring all indexation under the Scheme to 1 January of each year commencing on 1 January 1998. Members will note that the increases in copayments in the bill are to take effect on 1 January 1997 and that the indexation of the patient charges will not take place until the next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The method of indexing of the general safety net threshold and all patient charges is to be amended to allow the calculated figures to be rounded to the nearest of ten cents, that is up or down, not just down as was the previous arrangement. It has been of concern for some time that the previous rounding process worked against the interests of the taxpayer and these changes are considered to be a fairer method of sharing the rises in charges driven by CPI increases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, the final item in this bill concerns a matter of interest to all Australians for the government feels it is time to make it clear that this program is for Australian residents and not to be accessed by all who might be visiting our shores.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I hasten to add that visitors from countries with which Australia has a reciprocal health care agreement are to continue to receive the benefits as they are entitled to under those agreements. But it has been of concern for some time that persons visiting Australia have taken advantage of the PBS, and thus the Australian taxpayer, while here, and in some cases even after they have left our shores, to have their pharmaceutical needs subsidised by the Australian taxpayer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has not been uncommon to hear reports of drugs being found by Australia Post or the Customs <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Service in the process of being sent overseas to persons who clearly are not residents of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments change the National Health Act 1953 so that the PBS may only be accessed by persons eligible for Medicare benefits. These are Australian residents, eligible overseas representatives and other persons treated under the Health Insurance Act 1973 as being eligible persons, including visitors from countries with which Australia has a reciprocal health care agreement. Before supplying a pharmaceutical benefit the pharmacist will need to be satisfied that the patient is eligible for Medicare benefits. To this end the pharmacist may request the patient to show their Medicare card or some other document which establishes their eligibility for Medicare benefits, for example, a passport issued by a country with which Australia has a reciprocal health care agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The act continues to provide for refunds of excess moneys spent on pharmaceutical benefits where the patient is unable to satisfy the pharmacist that they are eligible but are later able to satisfy the Secretary to the Department as to their eligibility. The refunds by the government will be limited to the difference between what the patient should have paid and the Commonwealth dispensed price.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">These changes are estimated to reduce outlays on the PBS by $74.2 million in 1996&hyphen;97 and by $534.5 million over the following 3 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, I wish to only take a moment longer but I believe it would be helpful if I also outline other budget changes to the PBS that, while they do not require a legislative amendment, are being introduced to make the PBS a more economically viable program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will be asking the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC), the experts in these matters, to re&hyphen;assess significant drug groups listed prior to cost&hyphen;effectiveness criteria being applied to such listings, to ensure these medicines are providing value for money. Included in this group will be the calcium channel blockers and the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors used in the treatment of hypertension or high blood pressure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The PBAC has also been asked to advise on the delisting of the topical antifungal medicines which are generally used to treat minor diseases and which can be obtained over the counter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of this bill be adjourned until the first day of sitting in the autumn sittings, in accordance with the order agreed to on 29 November 1994.</PARA>

<PARA>The intent of the motion<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> is that the Senate would agree to a proposal to effectively not proceed with general business or the consideration of committee reports and government responses this afternoon and dedicate the time between 4.30 and 7.20 this afternoon to debating the committee stages of the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition government has received general agreement from all parties. I do understand the Greens have had some reservations about the proposal. I did discuss them with Senator Brown briefly yesterday afternoon. He did raise some reservations at the whips meeting, I understand&mdash;even though they were not discussed with me. We are very keen to ensure that the workplace relations bill gets thorough consideration in the chamber. We know that many people, particularly Labor Party senators, have very strong views on this, as indeed do people on our side. We want to ensure the legislation has a proper debate in the chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We thank the opposition and other parties who have indicated that they will support this motion.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are two matters to be brought up here. The first is that the chamber will be aware that the Greens are not in favour of the rush to the committee stage in the voting on the industrial relations legislation, because we believe that the community should have at least a couple of weeks to digest what is an enormously important piece of legislation and to feed back, and for this Senate to then have a debate based on that feedback. Senator Margetts's proposal, that we hold off until 18 November so that the community can have input, was not accepted by the chamber a couple of days ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That aside, I just wanted to flag the business of this Thursday contribution to affairs of the Senate. There is an informal agreement which allows for the 2&half; or three hours to be given across to the non&hyphen;government benches to discuss matters which are important to them. In the ordinary course of events, opposition, Labor Party, Democrat, Green and Independent matters are discussed in that time. I am concerned that here we have the opposition effectively giving the government that period of what I see as very important private members' time to discuss matters which I think are very important to us. If we give up that time to the government&mdash;which has control, essentially, over all the other hours of business in this chamber&mdash;we lose the ability to discuss matters which are important to us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have, for example, on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> a bill to alter the Electoral Act which I think is very important. It is a Democrat innovation and I think we ought to be discussing it this year. Jointly with Senator Lees there is another bill on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> for the phasing out of export woodchipping from our native forests. That is a highly contentious issue, but it is very important for many Australians. If the Greens simply accede to the process in hand, there is no hope of that bill being discussed this year and I would submit there is little hope of it being discussed next year. In the meantime, many of the forests that we are concerned about will have been chomped.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4856">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there is a certain urgency concerned with the legislation I have before the Senate, and it would be remiss of me not to promote the interests of that legislation being dealt with before Christmas. I do not believe that that legislation should be making way for an extra few hours debate on the industrial relations legislation which is being rushed through this place. I do not think that is good process. I do not agree with it, and I do not agree with the priorities. Having said that, I can inform the Senate that this morning I have had a word with the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Faulkner). I hope we have in hand a process for reviewing what happens with general business, with all components of the Senate being involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we look at the 20 or so Thursdays which come up in a year and if we look at the make&hyphen;up of the non&hyphen;government benches, there ought to be two periods in the year which are allocated to the Greens and Independents. There will be some 14 periods given across to the Labor Party and 3&half; of those periods will be given to the Democrats. Senator Margetts has informed me that the Greens had not had, before a week or two ago, a Thursday afternoon component for a long time. But we now have important legislation before the Senate and I would like to see those two bills that I have cited dealt with between now and Christmas. I recognise that we do not have the power to force the issue, and I do not want to delay debate. That is not in our interests, and it is not in the interests of the opposition or the government. But I do want to flag this matter because it is very important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Pursuing a conclusion on legislation brought before the Senate by the non&hyphen;government parties is a critical component of the Senate's contribution to democratic discourse in this nation of ours. So it is not a light matter; it is a very important matter indeed. To simply give over that period to rushed government debate&mdash;and I think it is unseemly rushed government debate&mdash;on industrial relations is not a thing I would do lightly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to take it any further, except to say I do not support this move. I think that period this afternoon should be given to the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> important matters that the opposition and people on the non&hyphen;government benches have. The government should, of course, be pursuing its industrial relations debate outside that time.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to place on the record that the opposition is supporting this proposal&mdash;in fact, we initiated it. I say it directly and clearly: we initiated this proposal. It is an unusual set of circumstances when an opposition, this early in the parliamentary process of sitting times, chooses to go to the government and suggest that we undertake consideration of legislation in a period which is reserved for general business discussion. We did this in these circumstances because of the importance of these matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not uncommon for governments to come to oppositions and say, `Will you give up opposition business time, the general business times, to consider government legislation?' When in government, our manager at that time did this on a regular occasion to the then opposition. It is extremely unusual for oppositions to agree to such a request, particularly some six weeks before the end of a session. It is not unknown for oppositions to agree to such a request later in the sittings, usually much later in November and, of course, in June, towards the end of particular sitting periods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would assert that the Labor opposition's attitude in this matter is particularly generous. As the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Faulkner) made very clear when this proposal was discussed, it is groundbreaking. He is a very modest man when it comes to describing the attributes, the particular generosities and the dedication of the opposition in the consideration of these extremely important legislative matters. We are committed to a proper and thorough examination of the legislative process and, of course, a consideration in a responsible manner of matters that are before the parliament. This is not necessarily because we want to see the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 passed. On the contrary, we see this bill as being obnoxious, insidious and fundamentally hostile to the interests of working <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4857"> people in this country. We see it as fundamentally opposed to the maintenance of living standards for working people in this country and as a device aimed at redistributing wealth and power towards people who are already extremely well positioned within our society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Greens senators have indicated their concern that there be greater community consultation. We acknowledge just how important community consultation is in this process. They  suggest that we ought not be giving up time, but that we should discuss matters that are of particular importance to them. We acknowledge that there are a very great number of issues that ought be discussed in this parliament. However, we put the view that, for our constituency, particularly for working men and women in this country, there can be no more fundamental issue than their wages and conditions, no more fundamental issue for Australians than the protection of their living standards, particularly when they are under such threat by this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many issues of concern to Australians which this parliament has to consider on a daily basis. But there could be no more fundamental issue for working people than the manner in which they are able to organise themselves, present their interests and, of course, defend themselves against attacks by employers and against the devices by which governments&mdash;such as the current government&mdash;are undertaking to reduce their wages and conditions and to reduce their positions of real bargaining power within the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will be taking very strenuous steps to ensure that there is full community consultation about these measures. In particular, we will be seeking to mobilise community opposition to and outrage against these measures which are aimed at reducing the power of workers and reducing the living standards and the wages and conditions of working people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is not true to suggest that the Labor Party, in particular, would seek to avoid community consultation about these matters. But what we do insist upon is that there is detailed consideration of these matters and that the full implications of arrangements entered into between the Democrats and the government are fully understood, so that we <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> can establish the priorities of political parties within this parliament and understand exactly what it is that the various interests in this parliament represent, and who it is that they are seeking to serve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that way, we want to see these measures discussed fully and understood and we want to see this bill defeated because it is quite clear that the workplace relations bill is an insidious bill which fundamentally breaches the rock&hyphen;solid guarantees that this government gave in the election campaign that no&hyphen;one would be worse off as a result of their industrial relations changes. We want to highlight the fact that this bill opens the door to the cutting of wages and conditions, particularly for young people. We want to highlight the fact that this bill fundamentally removes fairness which we argue has been entrenched in the industrial relations system. We want to highlight to the community how this bill proceeds fundamentally to work on the basis that working people are going to be disadvantaged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We say there is a flawed assumption that underlies this bill in that it presumes that there is, somehow or other, equal bargaining power within the economy and, in terms of industrial relations; that somehow or other employers and workers should be on the same footing when they are clearly not on the same footing. The so&hyphen;called Australian workplace agreements are devices by which real power will be distributed to the employer. The so&hyphen;called `employer advocate'&mdash;which is what it is&mdash;will be used fundamentally to undermine working people's positions. We will be trying to explain to the community&mdash;community consultation is what it is all about as far as we see it&mdash;just how this bill does not recognise the legitimate and desirable rights of workers to be able to organise effectively on the job and the rights of their unions to bargain effectively on a collective basis for those workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will be seeking to highlight that this bill greatly restricts the central role of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, that the arrangements entered into between the Democrats and the government do not seriously challenge that fundamental proposition and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4858"> that they reinforce the notion that workers should be isolated and removed from the protection of their unions by the undertaking of individual contracts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill undermines the award system as a dynamic framework for the protection and the advancement of wages and conditions. It is in that context that we say there are a range of priorities that this parliament must always consider. However, choices have to be made and this is one choice that we make willingly, openly and directly, to protect and represent our constituency in this parliament and to highlight the inadequacies of the government in regard to this particular measure. With that mind we say yes, we are making a generous offer to the government, but it is not on the basis that we seek to rush this bill through; it is on the basis that we want to carefully consider its implications and to do all that is in our power to defeat this odious legislation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wanted to make a couple of points, mostly in response to Senator Brown in relation to the amount of time that non-government business has actually been dealt with this year to date. The clerks have very kindly provided me with an analysis of that. It shows that 64 per cent of the Senate's time has been devoted to non-government business and government business has taken up 36 per cent of that time. The total amount of time devoted to government legislation is 26 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To put those figures in some context for other honourable senators, the average amount of time in 1994 that non-government business was dealt with was down to around 58 per cent to 59 per cent and the amount of time spent on government business was up to around 42 per cent to 41 per cent. The differential has changed quite significantly. In terms of the actual hours devoted to debating government legislation, which is some measure of time, it is worth while putting these figures on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record. In 1984 the then government was achieving about 11 hours and 10 minutes per week. In 1995 it was about the same figure. In the 1996 year to date this government has been achieving about seven hours of government business a week. We have a problem there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> We genuinely appreciate the attempts of the opposition and other senators to recognise that the government should have its program debated. The government also recognises that there will be a number of very contentious issues, and the workplace relations bill is one of them. It has obviously been a very contentious issue throughout the history of Austral ian federation. It was a contentious issue when the founding fathers debated the arbitration powers in the constitution, and it will continue to be. There are very genuine heart-felt disagreements over those matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For Senator Brown to say that this debate is being rushed also belies the fact that, to date, this chamber has spent 16 hours and 25 minutes debating the legislation. Four hours has been spent on the committee stage this week. If you do a rough calculation based on some of the previous strong, heartfelt debates in this chamber on things such as native title and the land fund, at the rate that we are progressing at the moment on the committee stage&mdash;I am not making this point to be churlish in any way&mdash;we will spend about 150 hours on the committee stage. I am not saying that that is the rate at which we will proceed. I think it is fair to say to honourable senators that the objects stage of the committee debate clearly gives senators a time to range far and wide over many issues. I did listen to the debate very carefully yesterday. It looks more like a repeat of a second reading debate. I respect the contributions that have been made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To say, Senator Brown, that we are rushing that debate is far from the truth. The government obviously would not intend to spend this amount of time but, on the current rate of progress&mdash;and I hope other honourable senators do not intend that we spend this much time on it&mdash;we would spend 150 or 200 hours on the committee stage debate, based on previous experience with things like the Native Title Act, which is the best example you can base it on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At that rate, we will actually spend 20 weeks debating the committee stage, so that is not a rush. We do want to ensure that all of the issues are canvassed. I am sure that anyone in Australia who has an interest in industrial relations will be tuning in to the parliamentary network and speaking to senators and lobbying them. Obviously, our friends in the gallery will focus on the content of the debate. It is a packed gallery today. It is good to see that AAP are still up there, and to see our friends in the public galleries. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4860"> There will be a focus on it and the debate will allow that focus, Senator Brown.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do hope that you will take this opportunity. The opposition and the government have both made it quite clear that private members business is, of course, an important part of the Senate chamber, and we respect that fact. I hope that those figures will reinforce the dilemma and the challenge that the government faces and we do genuinely appreciate the cooperation that senators on the crossbenches have shown from time to time. We would like more cooperation. We will try to keep communication lines open so that you know what we are seeking to do.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Campbell has already alluded to the fact that the debate was wide ranging. It is appropriate on the objects clause of the bill to have a wide ranging philosophical debate because the objects, as has been mentioned previously, are critical to providing a signpost showing the direction and the underlying philosophy of the amendments that we are dealing with in respect of the bill before us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I make any more comments, I would like to indicate that we have one further amendment to schedule 1. I will provide copies of this amendment to senators at this point and I will make a few comments about why we are moving this further amendment a little later. I will be doing it briefly.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do acknowledge Senator Campbell's concern about the rate of progress but I would point out that the rate of progress on this bill will vary according to the schedules. For example, in schedule 2, I would anticipate much more rapid progress. Schedule 1 is the underlying philosophy, which identifies the objectives of the bill, and it is an area where I think it was obvious that there was going to be some time spent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just to briefly make some comments about a number of the amendments that we have moved to schedule 1, in respect of the amendment to subclause (c), Senator Cook concluded on this area in his contribution yesterday afternoon. The Labor members who participated in this debate certainly reflected on that change very well yesterday. The same applies with respect to our amendment to subclause (d).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to our amendment to subclause (f), where we state that the bill must provide a framework for fair and effective bargaining, not just agreement making, as is provided for in this bill, we highlighted, again through the contributions made by my colleagues yesterday, that the fairness provided in the bargaining process is very important. It is not just fairness in terms of the ultimate making of the agreement but fairness in that bargaining process. Again, Labor senators yesterday highlighted the inequity in bargaining power between an individual worker and an individual employer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One aspect that I will touch on here is this issue of fairness as it relates to new employees. When an agreement has been reached and registered, where is the fairness for a new employee who starts work? The government would certainly argue that they have a choice of accepting the agreement that has been negotiated, but, in reality, how fair is it to a new employee in that situation? The agreement has been negotiated. They have had no input into it. We are critical of that process anyway. The new employee comes along. They inevitably have to accept the outcome of that bargaining process that has already occurred. We will make more comment about that later on in the specific provisions of the bill before us.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4861">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to subclause (g), we accept that the act should ensure freedom of association, but we add that the act must nevertheless maintain the rights of employees to organise and bargain collectively. I think the words of the Democrat amendment are `and are able to operate effectively'. They are the new words that are proposed in the joint government&hyphen;Democrat deal document that we were provided with on Monday. Certainly the words `and are able to operate effectively' are added, but contrast this with the specific provisions in the bill&mdash;45D and E. Will employee organisations, unions, be able to operate effectively within the confines of the proposed changes to 45D and E? The Democrats' amendment really only goes some way to addressing our concerns in that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Freedom of association provisions should not be placing any obstacle on the right of employees&mdash;this is recognised in international law&mdash;to organise and bargain collectively. When we get into the provisions of the act in some detail, we will have some specific examples of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To subclause (h) we add a requirement for the act to encourage and facilitate the development and registration of organisations. This is very important, not just for trade unions but also for employer organisations. It is vital, if we are to maintain the cooperative spirit in our industrial relations system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we look at international systems, we see that cooperative spirit is very important. We are talking about cooperative spirit not just at the workplace level. As my colleagues have pointed out, unfortunately at times there is not a great deal of cooperation at any number of workplaces. Certainly that can be a minority of workplaces, but we have laws that operate where this cooperative working spirit does not exist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sceptical about the degree to which Australian culture will change, particularly quickly, in terms of cooperative spirit. There is, no doubt, significant cooperative spirit at the moment, but I think the day when we are going to see this great outburst of back slapping and self-congratulation between employees and employers is a long way away.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Often the leadership of the employee organisations, contrary to the belief the government would enunciate, does have to provide some guidance to employees on particular issues. I can recall having to face up to a pretty hostile meeting of brewery workers to attempt to convince them that they should give away their `beeros', the free distribution of alcohol in breweries. I did not get a very pleasant reception when I was supporting that proposal from the employers. I had to point out the accident rate in the two breweries in Tasmania. There were quite horrific consequences from some people drinking alcohol before work, at morning tea, at lunchtime, at afternoon tea and after work. That was not a particularly popular position. I just raise that as an example of where employee organisations have to provide leadership and as an example of the importance of employee organisations in our industrial process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can say the same for employer organisations. Many is the occasion in my experience when, regrettably, irresponsible employers have breached agreements with respect to treatment of their employees. We have responsible employer organisations&mdash;various chambers of commerce. That is not on all occasions, I have to say. Often I disagree with them. But employer organisations would often have to counsel their constituent members about behaviour and treatment of employees. The continuance of the objective of ensuring and facilitating the development and registration of organisations is very important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of subclause (i), some comments were made by colleagues, as well as in respect of subclause (l) relating to ILO conventions and meeting international obligations. Again, those points were covered very well in the debate that occurred yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In concluding my remarks at this stage, I have a few brief comments about the amendment we have circulated this morning. The amendment to schedule 1, objectives, relates to item 1 on page 4. It is a new subclause (f)(a). It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"encouraging the right of employees to bargain collectively and" <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4862"> </PARA>
<PARA>We call this the Senator Murray amendment. We really would like him to consider this particular amendment because, in reflecting on the deal between the government and the Democrats, we were somewhat perturbed and concerned. Senator Murray did a great job at the Senate Economics References Committee, particularly as a new senator, in listening to submissions, along with his colleagues on that committee. Senator Murray did an excellent job in identifying the particular problems that employees face in bargaining collectively. The preamble to the recommendation of the Australian Democrats on page 330 states in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Majority report highlights some of the most important omissions from the proposed objects of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Murray was spot on on behalf of the Australian Democrats. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats share the concern of the Majority report that the proposed objects give insufficient attention to the need to promote fairness in the labour market&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>The recommendation from Senator Murray on behalf of the Australian Democrats reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is recommended that the objects clause in the bill be broadly supported, but that it be further amended to take into account the concerns expressed in the majority report, to ensure that employees maintain the protection of an up to date award system and access to the independent umpire in the AIRC, that the bill encourages collective bargaining as a means of evening up the otherwise dominant bargaining position of employers, and that the processes and procedures of the AIRC be kept as user friendly, practical and non&hyphen;legalistic as possible.</PARA>
<PARA>I re&hyphen;emphasise the two critical lines: `that the bill encourages collective bargaining as a means of evening up the otherwise dominant bargaining position of employers'. We have reflected as a Labor opposition on this very important point that Senator Murray made. We have taken the words from Senator Murray in his report&mdash;an excellent comment, Senator Murray&mdash;and we have encapsulated it in the amendment that we have circulated this morning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is unfortunate that your comments on the right of employees to bargain collectively has not been taken up adequately in your deal with the government in this respect. We are <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> calling on you to support the amendment that has been circulated this morning, along with our other amendments.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Sherry, you are preying on my private sympathies publicly. I should remind you with respect to the remarks you made about beer that the Germans found a very good way to get around it. They disguised beer consumption during working hours as quality control.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to return to the Democrat&hyphen;government amendments that are before you. Amendment No. 1 seeks to ensure that the first and primary objective of the act is not just a flexible labour market but one that is also fair. I believe&mdash;and I said so in my first speech&mdash;that fairness is a very important principle. I was disappointed to hear one senator use it in the same framework of reference as the H.R. Nicholls Society did; namely, referring to it as a weasel word. If you check your <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> you will see that that was referred to. Fortunately, I discovered that Minister Reith is not a member of the H.R. Nicholls Society and has been happy to see this absolutely important principle included.  </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4863">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendments Nos 2 and 3 are to ensure that the award safety net of fair minimum wages and conditions is maintained. That was a vital change. This is an important amendment in that it makes clear that it is not the object of the act that awards merely wither on the vine. Rather, they should be kept up to date and relevant to provide the minimum standards for enterprise agreements and to ensure that workers are protected. The clauses must also be enforceable. These provisions also mirror the objects of the awards part of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment No. 4 was a very important amendment reflecting our strong belief that unions are an important and vital part in the industrial relations framework and should be allowed and entitled to operate effectively. This object makes it clear that it is a role for the AIRC and the Office of the Employment Advocate to ensure that unions are not just recognised but able to operate effectively. That means actively intervening to prevent attempts to de&hyphen;unionise workplaces, which we oppose, or to reduce the status of unions. This additional phrase is attached to an equally important object that unions should be representative of and accountable to their members, which we agree with and we believe is also equally important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendments Nos 5 and 6 are important because they reflect the modified role that the Democrats wish to see implemented for the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. As I have said before, I believe that this bill is an evolutionary bill providing a further level of reform of the labour market&mdash;the clear reform thrust that we are prepared to support. Within this evolving framework there is a continuing role for the AIRC. That role, I believe, is to protect the rights of workers and also employers in a weak bargaining position. As we move through the amendments it will become clear that this is a recurring theme of our amendments and the change of the object makes it clear that those arbitration powers of the commission should be exercised as is consistent with this evolving role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment No. 7&mdash;and I am sure Labor senators will concur&mdash;is easily the most important of the amendments to the objects <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> clause being moved by the Democrats and the government. It requires the commission and the Employment Advocate in the Federal Court to have full regard for our international obligations in respect of labour standards. That is vitally important. If Australia is to hold its head high as a defender of human rights, it must ensure that it practises what it preaches. We and all others know that labour rights are human rights, that workers are a part of the human rights movement and that unions are groups of workers and are part of the human rights movement. The International Labour Organisation is a United Nations affiliated body.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is signatory to a wide range of ILO conventions and United Nations covenants on labour standards. These as ratified treaties are part of our common law, but I believe it is vital that these are reflected in the industrial relations bill itself. It is also necessary from a legal point of view to have this recognition in place. As Gough Whitlam reminded us recently, the High Court, only last month in upholding the use of the external powers to underpin the AIRC's jurisdiction on equal remuneration for work of equal value, on work and family balance and unfair dismissals, referred to the particular importance of the object in the current bill referring to international obligations. I am pleased that the Democrats have been able to persuade the government to insert in this legislation an object referring to the importance of giving effect to our international obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to turn to the ALP amendment which seeks to build on the proposed objects of the bill. We believe that the ALP amendment raised some important issues and we sought to pursue those issues in our discussions with the government. In particular, we supported the need for the bill to aim for a labour market which was both flexible and fair, the need for the award system to be maintained and up to date, the need for organisations of employees to be able to operate effectively and the need for the bill to assist in meeting our international obligations. All of these points dealt with in the Labor amendments are picked up in another form in our amendments. As such, the Democrats do <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4864"> not see the need for following the wording proposed by the ALP while having much sympathy with their aims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to discuss briefly the ALP's proposed object (f), which they have adapted, in which they sought to add the words `while maintaining the rights of employers and employees to organise and bargain collectively'. The Democrats strongly support collective bargaining and we have sought in all our discussions with government to ensure that collective bargaining is primarily maintained and reinforced. As we go through this debate, the amendments we have sought to enhance the abilities of employees to bargain collectively will become apparent. But we have been persuaded that it is unnecessary to include it in an object. We already have the ability of employers and employees to choose the most appropriate form of agreement for their particular circumstances as an object. That appropriate form of agreement will obviously include collective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will have a new object for organisations to operate effectively. That refers to collective. We have object (e) providing a framework for fair and effective agreement making. Most importantly, we have a new object of assisting in meeting our international obligations&mdash;the important one of which, I will remind you, because you know it well, is the ILO convention on collective bargaining.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The primary means of collective bargaining is obviously certified agreements. The act makes it quite clear that certified agreements override Australian workplace agreements. This is an important restatement of collective over individual. The certified agreements stream is the pre&hyphen;eminent stream in this act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an important restatement and, more importantly, the act will contain a positive duty on the AIRC to encourage the making of certified agreements. This is found in proposed section 170L, the object of part 6B and 170LA. This combined effect is that the commission is required to perform its functions in a way which facilitates the making and certifying of agreements. Thus, if a union has notified a bargaining period, the commission is required to try to bring that bargaining period to a successful conclusion through <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> conciliation. There is no similar requirement to encourage the making of AWAs or individual agreements under the act. So, read as a whole, the Democrats believe that there is a considerable and strong emphasis on encouraging collective bargaining in the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to turn briefly to a few of the remarks made yesterday. I want to talk about the awards issue. The Prime Minister, John Howard, created a wonderful device for us&mdash;and what some have seen as a major rod for himself&mdash;in the lead&hyphen;up to the last election by giving rock solid guarantees that workers would not be disadvantaged by his IR policy. If we look upon that favourably, it was in fact a statement that he was not prepared to see the working conditions of Australians eroded. He told the freight conference in October last year, `No worker in Australia under the Howard industrial relations policy can have his or her award conditions taken away,' and that was referred to at length by a number of senators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I used that quote in my supplementary report to the Senate inquiry report into this bill. I pointed out that the committee had received contradictory advice on whether section 89A, the allowable award matters, picked up all of the important award conditions or not. I also pointed out that there is a need to modernise and make the award system more user friendly and that Labor's section 15OA process simply was not working. I should make the point here, which I have made privately to members on both sides of the House without contradiction, that, in my opinion, in many respects, this bill is the son of Brereton and continues the work that Labor began. The modernisation and simplification process is one of those areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My recommendation was a simple one&mdash;that section 89A be amended to more accurately reflect the government's pre-election commitments, and it has been. Superannuation is in. Variation to hours notice periods and rest breaks are in. Skill based career paths are in. Outworkers are in. The provisions will be given a broader interpretation to include all matters incidental but necessary for the effective operation of an award.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4865">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ACTU has asked us about accident make&hyphen;up leave. I have QC's advice that that is in as well. On top of that, if the matters are not in&mdash;and independent legal advice says that over 95 per cent of award matters, including all the entitlement clauses, are picked up&mdash;and the workers cannot reach agreement with the employers on the provisions, they can have the conditions maintained if the commission determines it would otherwise be harsh or unjust. That, fellow senators, is a massive concession that we have won from the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this means is that unnecessary and cumbersome union weighted and union privileged clauses and awards inserted because of the dominant power of the union will still be modernised, simplified and reviewed or moved to agreements, but where the employees have little bargaining strength, or where the employer is in a bargaining position capable of imposing harsh or unjust outcomes on employees, the conditions will stay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said earlier, this reflects the new evolving role of the commission not as the arbitrator between employer and union power but as the defender of workers in a weak bargaining position. That is what this bill is about. It is about not only moving employees and employers capable of enterprise bargaining into being able to make fair and productive bargains but also ensuring that employees with little bargaining strength&mdash;the bottom third, as Professor Ron McCallum describes them&mdash;are adequately protected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This system, we believe, is rigorous enough to give the balance between the government's desire to encourage bargaining and the Democrats' desire to protect the vulnerable in the work force. We, the Democrats, are not here to protect union privileges or to defend 70&hyphen;page documents designed to tie employers up in unnecessary knots. We are here to provide fairness and balance and to assist employees and employers who need assistance. That is what we have done in the bill, in the award system, in the certified agreement stream, in the AWAs and in the union rights to representation. This approach will <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> become clear as we debate the remainder of our amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have some final comments. There have been lots of remarks from the house, as we have expected, on secrecy and deals. I am of the opinion, as you heard me remark the other day, that those are generally political points. I refute that the deal is secret or, indeed, is worth elaborating on. If you truly believe that our agreement, now published openly and circulated to all senators, is a secret, it is the worst kept secret and the most open secret I have ever heard of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many meetings in politics in which many people would like to be a fly on the wall. I would have loved to have been at Kirribilli, for example. I would have liked to have been underneath the Sydney Town Hall at New South Wales ALP meetings. I would love and would have loved to be in the cabinet rooms of both governments.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will respond to Senator Harradine. I will make two points. I was going to respond to some of the points that were made during the debate yesterday and, as you have said correctly, Senator Harradine, that was a point that Senator Hogg and a number of other senators have raised&mdash;and it is an important one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, the opposition in their own amendment No. 1&mdash;and I refer Senator Hogg to that&mdash;have used exactly the same words; that is, `encouraging the pursuit of high employment and improved living standards'. There is another debate over better pay which is also in the objects. I am sure that the opposition, when they drafted their own amendment and put in the words `high employment', would have had in their minds just what that meant. But in terms of the object of it, the pursuit of high employment means exactly what it says. You can seek to reinterpret it in terms of participation rates, and so forth. But my own definition of high employment would be that those who are seeking work are able to get it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think, Senator Hogg, you made a point yesterday in relation to casual work, part&hyphen;time work and so forth. There is nothing in the bill and that certainly is not the intention of the government; I cannot speak on behalf of the Democrats, but I am sure that it is their position. The government's intent is that people are able, and more able through this <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> bill when it passes into law, to have a range of choices. There are many people in Australia clearly who at the moment do have part&hyphen;time work who would like full&hyphen;time work; there are many people who have casual work who would probably like to have permanent part&hyphen;time work; and there are probably many people who are working casually who would like to have well paid full&hyphen;time work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the point Senator Harradine probably alludes to is that there are probably people who have full-time work or work of some kind who would rather not work at all and who may prefer to stay at home and look after their children. But, in relation to the matter of the definition in these objects of the words `high employment', we make no judgments or prescriptions.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the parliamentary secretary. You point to the fact that the opposition's amendment includes similar words. It is precisely for that reason I asked you the question and not the opposition. As I read the bill, the bill will establish a regimen which ultimately will mean that workers will be worse off both in pay and conditions. If workers who have family responsibilities are worse off in pay and conditions&mdash;particularly in pay&mdash;it will mean that more people in that family will have to seek paid work in, say, the part&hyphen;time employment area just to make ends meet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You talk about freedom of choice. That is not freedom of choice, I can tell you. And I can tell you another thing: go out there into the shops and workplaces into which I have gone and find out what is the major emotion in the hearts of employees when they consider this particular legislation. I will tell you what it is: it is fear&mdash;fear that they will lose their job; fear that they will have their pay reduced; fear that, if they do not lose their job, they will be going onto part&hyphen;time work. I tell the government that that is how workers feel at the present moment. That is the predominant feeling amongst workers at the moment, particularly those who are not unionised. I say to the Australian Democrats that they will need to think of that too when other questions <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4868"> come up in respect of the need to ensure that workers are properly represented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not intend to pursue this greatly, but I do ask the government to take on board this very question on which I do not think we have focused enough up to this stage&mdash;and I am not speaking of in this debate, Parliamentary Secretary, but over the last few years. We just have not looked at the question of what unemployment is. We have said, `Oh, increase the jobs' and people have said, `Oh, yes, look at the increase in the number of people in jobs.' But there is not a corresponding reduction in the unemployment figures. Very often they both go up together. The reason for that is that there are more people in or seeking paid work than there are jobs available at the same time as new jobs are being slashed through increased automation and technical change. That has been the case now for perhaps five or 10 years, or more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We really do have to face up to that, and I flag it very seriously here that we should be looking at it. We should be looking at those people who are in the paid work force who do not wish to be there but are required to be there because of their economic circumstances. It is not a matter of choice, in that case. There is the case that the parliamentary secretary mentioned, but there are other socially desirable alternatives, where income support is necessary in some way so that those persons can pursue these socially desirable alternatives as a matter of choice. I thought that I would raise that matter at this point, but obviously there will be other occasions on which we can canvass it and related matters.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Given the discussion that we have just had on employment, it is perhaps an appropriate time to suggest that the government now respond not just to the employment issues but to the several issues that were raised yesterday, to the extent that the government is prepared do so at this stage. Otherwise, I can imagine that in this debate we will continue raising one issue after another issue and end up going around in circles.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to highlight two issues: one relates to the objects, which I focused on yesterday, and the other follows Senator Murray's comments relating to the provisions in the objects clause regarding awards. Senator Murray referred to the Australian Democrats' agreement with the government as maintaining the award system. I made the point yesterday that I do not think the objects as they stand maintain the award system&mdash;certainly as we know it. It is a system that we have worked with for near a century. The objects as they now stand simply refer to awards as a minimum safety net.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to know how the government has convinced the Democrats that an award safety net is an award system. It certainly is not in keeping with the comments made by the Democrats in their report following our inquiry relating to the award system: it should be comprehensive and it should have broad arbitration powers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point that I would like to concentrate on, following Senator Murray's comments, relates to the promotion of collective bargaining. I would like to know how the government also convinced the Democrats that the bill meets the issue of collective bargaining and that there is no need for an objective in the objects clause to specifically refer to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Murray referred to the ILO and the reference to ILO conventions in the objects. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4869"> We still have in the objects clause provisions with respect to discrimination, but there are ILO conventions relating to discrimination. So why has the government been able to convince the Democrats to specifically exclude what currently exists in the act with respect to the promotion of registered organisations? Why have they been able to convince the Democrats to move away from their position in their committee report that collective bargaining should be promoted?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The line put by Senator Murray that there are priorities for certified agreements means nothing. The priority in the bill for certified agreements exists only until they have expired. It will not affect the bargaining position of workers. It gives no priority to collective bargaining for workers. Once the nominal expiry date of a certified agreement is reached, once the negotiating period has expired&mdash;even if the certified agreement might still be continuing in form&mdash;there is no priority. There is no promotion of collective bargaining. There is nothing. So we then go back to the question: to what extent does this bill actually deal with our international obligations, because it does not promote collective bargaining in any form?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I raise this issue at this stage because it is now appropriate for the government to respond to the several issues that were raised. I have highlighted two issues, but there are several more. We could continue day after day asking questions on this until we actually hear something sensible from the government. The government has sat there saying, `This relates to native title,' and, `This compares to native title,' et cetera. I would like to make a comparison as to how we dealt with native title.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Jacinta Collins talks about the government's responses. I privately said to Senator Sherry just a few minutes ago, when I was finding out how he wanted to run this debate, that I was going to respond in detail to the contributions made yesterday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Very few of the contributions made yesterday did deal with substantive policy issues on the points. There were some, and I have a list of them. I have listened very carefully to the debate and have responses. Senator Cooney, in particular, actually dealt with some issues that do require specific responses. He asked quite specific questions. I have already said to Senator Cooney that I will provide those. I will seek leave to incorporate a document to give him quite detailed answers to his detailed questions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The majority of yesterday's debate was actually about political points. There is a fundamental philosophical difference between the two sides of the chamber. The opposition wants to retain an encouragement of and specific reference to collective bargaining and seek for there to be a substantive legislative encouragement in one form or another of coming to a workplace bargain arrangement. The coalition's position&mdash;and the Democrats have in many respects agreed with this&mdash;is that we do not in this legislation seek to favour one form of bargaining over another. Much of the comment yesterday was based on that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does not matter how many times you ask me why we do not put specific legislative provisions into place to encourage collective bargaining, I will keep giving you the same answer. That debate has pretty much been <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4870"> thoroughly canvassed in second readings, because it is a significant philosophical difference between your approach and the approach the government is taking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Collins, I did say to Senator Sherry earlier that I was prepared, once everyone from your side had spoken during the committee stage, to try to respond to those points that I thought required a significant response. Then, wherever it is required, I will seek leave to incorporate documents and so forth once you have all put your positions on the record. I did not interrupt you yesterday or today. I thought that was a sensible way to progress, and I thought that was the way we were going to progress. Senator Sherry recently informed me that you now have a series of specific questions that you want to put to the government, which I am very happy to answer to the best of my ability.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have something in common, Senator Childs. I think we both support the concept of high employment. We do not, however, seek to define that. There is nothing in the bill that says we are trying to move towards part time and casualisation. There was&mdash;you are right, Senator Hogg&mdash;a significant move towards that form of work over the past 13 years or so. That occurred under Mr Keating. I am not seeking to make a political point here. It was a massive change. You would have known because of your own experiences in the labour movement that that has occurred.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That suits some people and does not suit others. There are many people who work casual and part time who would like to have full-time employment. I think it was back in 1993 that there were about a million people unemployed&mdash;that is the raw number. I think a number of reports said that there were at least another million who had casual or part-time work or only worked a couple of hours a week who would have loved full-time jobs. So hidden unemployment was nearly twice that again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So your point is taken. We are not seeking to make a judgment about that in this bill. Our bill seeks to encourage higher employment. For many people that means full-time employment; for others it might mean casual or part-time employment. This bill does not seek to make a judgment or encourage people one way or the other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4871"> The object of the act reflects the intention that the flexibilities and choices provided by this bill will have a positive effect on the economy which, in turn, will lead to higher employment. The form that that employment will take is the form of employment that is appropriate to particular employee needs. We hope that there will be a lot more choice. There is not a lot of choice out there at the moment. There are, as I said, a lot of people who do not work part time by choice. They work part time because that is all they can get. There are a lot of people out there who are in that situation. I have friends and family who are in that situation. They work casually at the moment but would love to have perma nent work.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe in a number of regards this act coming into law will have the effect of increasing employment, increasing choices and increasing employment opportunities for many people. I do not say that just off the top of my head. There are a number of people, such as the Retail Council of Australia, who estimate that something like 200,000 jobs for juniors would be at risk in their industry if junior wage rates, for example, were replaced. There are a number of reports, including the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yellow Pages</EMPHASIS>  surveys and various other surveys by ACCI, in relation to the impact of the unfair dismissal laws if they are not changed. That is a part of this act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there are a number of people out there who think that employment will improve as a result of this act.

That, of course, as we all understand, is a quite critical change from the past when references were often to full employment deriving from post&hyphen;war settlements, principally in Europe and the United States, which flowed through to this country and the public policy mechanisms that were created to give effect to that full employment. The common understanding of full employment was, indeed, employment where everyone who sought it was able to achieve it and a range of institutions were created to give effect to that. That critical change in the amendment proposed by the government and the Democrats to high employment seems to me&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The corollary of that change is that it suggests to me that a level of unemployment is to be&mdash;if not encouraged, at worst&mdash;tolerated because when we had full employment as an objective, it meant, certainly by express implication, that nothing else was acceptable. When we have high employment, it leaves some out. So I ask the parliamentary secretary what level of unemployment does the government anticipate as a consequence of this bill. Is it 10 per cent or 12 per cent? Or do you anticipate the level of unemployment to descend to US levels of four or five or six per cent? It seems to me that issue is a necessary consequence of the declining levels of investment and seems to be, if not encouraged, a necessary consequence of this objective. So I ask the parliamentary secretary to take that question on notice and either respond now or later; or respond now as to what levels of unemployment are considered acceptable by this government.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I would like to refer the minister to this. So perhaps he can take this on notice or respond now but I will give him the opportunity to take it on notice because I am referring him to the report from the inquiry. At page 145, it talks about the Australian Retailers Association's submission with respect to youth wages but also makes the point that, in its oral evidence to the committee, the association accepted that the industry had agreed to a different wages system which <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> did not offend the prohibition on discrimination required by the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a consequence of that, there would not be huge levels of unemployment associated with a reduction in youth employment in the retail industry.

In order to focus Senator Campbell's mind at bit in relation to this policy matter on the issue of employment, which is the most fundamental issue facing Australia today, I would like to restate Senator Bishop's question, which is: what does the government regard as an acceptable level of unemployment? That is the first thing. Senator Campbell really ought to be able to answer that question, given the statements made by <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4873"> the government recently in relation to employment growth and the fact that the government's better pay for better work promise clearly stated its policy of high productivity and high wages.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps it would focus Senator Campbell's mind if I draw his attention to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS> report on the Dun and Bradstreet survey of small business in which small business was asked if the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 would lead to greater productivity. Eighteen per cent of those surveyed said yes, and 82 per cent of those surveyed said no.

The words `full employment', of course, come from the charter of the Reserve Bank and a whole range of mechanisms have been created over the last 40 to 50 years to give effect to that objective. Indeed, in the last two or three <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> weeks your own government has recognised the priority of employment, jobs and job creation and presumably either full or high employment, because it has created a jobs committee comprising a range of senior ministers.

A key institution is going to have a different focus, a conflicting focus, with that of the charter of the Reserve Bank. The Reserve Bank is going to carry out a range of measures designed to achieve full employment. This particular institution is to be amended to achieve a different purpose and one queries how the two are going to achieve a common end. So I ask the parliamentary secretary again: what levels of unemployment or underemployment will be achieved and what is acceptable to this government in the foreseeable future?</PARA></SPEECH>

What I am trying to flesh out&mdash;it is not a trick question&mdash;is: what are the sorts of jobs that the government aims to have created by this legislation?

Is it a matter of just more people being employed for fewer hours, or actual numbers of people being employed in more meaningful jobs? What are those jobs going to look like?

International competitiveness, in the context of the Australian economy, is an absolute irrelevancy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have an economy of something in the order of $400 billion. Our exports are something in the order of $40 billion to $50 billion per year. The overall bulk of those exports are commodities, low value adding and lesser ETMs. The percentage of our GDP allocated to exports is less than eight per cent. Hence, increasing international competitiveness of low value commodities and the like has a negligible impact on the domestic economy and the growth of GDP. It certainly has an impact on productivity, but little on the domestic economy. That is why I asked the question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If competitiveness and productivity are different things, not similes, why is international competitiveness important to domestic production, which is the overwhelming bulk of production in this country? Goods that are produced internally for internal consumption, not for trading and not for export orientation, account for 90 per cent of the production in this economy. It is irrelevant what is done in the United States, China or Malaysia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition supports the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996 and particularly welcomes the initiatives to assist defence force personnel. Importantly, the bill provides for a reduction in eligibility for loans from six years to five years and extends the eligibility to include reserves and emergency forces. Let me stress that these measures are welcomed by the opposition; indeed they are measures which Labor committed to prior to the last election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the position that the government took on these matters during the campaign itself, the Liberal Party's policy statement did include certain matters that are contained in this bill. The relevant section from the Liberal Party's own document says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coalition will increase the maximum loan value under the ADF home assistance scheme from $40,000 to $80,000 and the eligibility period will be reduced to five years. This will come into effect by 1 July 1996, not 1 January 1997 as proposed by Labor.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>As I read the Liberal Party's election document, there clearly are parts of the document that have been supported in this bill. In other words, part of the commitments made have been honoured. When the government indicated that its scheme was better than the Labor Party's scheme because it operated from 1 July, I suppose some of them actually believed it, though I suspect not all of them did.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of those in uniform, trusting and loyal individuals that they are, did take the coalition at its word. When the coalition said that it would be available from 1 July, they did not <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4879"> think that meant the bill would be introduced on the second last sitting day in June, some time in August the parliament might get around to dealing with it, some time in October it would be listed for consideration in the Senate and perhaps some time in November it would be given assent by the Governor-General in Council so that, in fact, defence force personnel would be eligible for it in December. When the government said they would be eligible on 1 July, I suspect they actually thought you meant it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This one provision for a home loan subsidy for defence personnel was actually part of a number of initiatives the Labor government was addressing before the last election. They arose from the Glenn review, established by former Minister Punch. During the Glenn review, he identified a range of issues that required improvement if we were to ensure that defence personnel conditions kept pace with their needs and with contemporary employment practices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things that was mentioned then was an increase in the maximum amount available under the defence home owners scheme. On 10 December last year, the then minister, Minister Punch, issued a statement on behalf of the Labor government undertaking to implement that commitment. It was not just that one commitment; it was not in isolation. This was not a bandaid approach to address the needs of defence personnel. This was part of a coordinated approach to ensure that the net of services, benefits and remuneration available to people in defence was the best to attract high quality people and to retain them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also gave commitments in relation to child care, occasional care, family day care and an ADF spouse employment program. We gave commitments in relation to exemption for ADF members from changes to the superannuation preservation rules. We also gave commitments in relation to improvements in compassionate leave, the extension of education assistance provisions, the introduction of reunion travel for dependent tertiary students, the introduction of spouse emergency travel, the introduction of pre&hyphen;posting travel for members with special needs and dependants, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> an extension of remote locality leave travel provisions and also the removal of the anomaly in tax rebates for United Nations deployments. All of these things were part of a coordinated approach that Labor was committed to prior to the last election, one of which was the improvement to the home loan subsidy scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say again: the opposition will support this bill. We support the improvements in the home loan subsidy scheme and we are waiting to hear what you are going to do about a number of other issues. As I have indicated, I think we are going to have here a piecemeal approach&mdash;a bandaid approach, if you like.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am interested also in listening and understanding in the future whether the government will endeavour to sidestep the entire Glenn review process. The recently released Glenn review identified the need for a long-term, strategic personnel policy which appropriately recognises the importance of manpower as a defence asset. In the words of the coalition:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to other measures identified in this policy, the Coalition will implement a long-term strategic personnel plan in accordance with the principles identified in the Glenn review.</PARA>
<PARA>The question is: where is it? It seems to me that the government has gone AWOL since the election on these matters. You don't let people talk about the Glenn review any more. You have not come out with a coherent policy statement in relation to defence personnel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as it goes, I believe that this bill makes good sense. But it does not go far enough, because it does not honour the election undertakings which the government made great play of during the election campaign. It is not satisfactory, because, of course, it is ad hoc and piecemeal. It is taken in isolation, and it does not address in a coherent and considered way the problems which were identified in the Glenn report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that the government will not be continuing to deal with defence personnel matters on such an ad hoc and impromptu basis. I hope that we have a far more considered and planned approach. If the objective and direction of the government's approach is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4880"> to ensure that the defence personnel of the three services are properly remunerated, are properly rewarded and are better placed to do their job, I can assure you that you will have my support and the opposition's support. It is for these reasons that, as I have indicated, the opposition will, in the circumstances, be supporting this legislation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(1.01 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Defence Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996 amends the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 and the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Act 1990. The Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 is to be amended to close a loophole which stops ADF members serving overseas from being prosecuted for offences such as sexual assault and other serious offences. Of course, the Greens would support this, because it is important for many reasons, including Australia's good standing, for this to be able to be clear in any case of such alleged incidents occurring.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also amends the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Act 1990 to increase the maximum amount of a subsidised loan to $80,000 for each member of the forces, and to reduce the period for eligibility from six years to five years. This has been mentioned already by Senator Faulkner. This is another incentive to try to keep people in the ADF and give them nicer conditions. The Greens would support this as well. The bill, in itself, is not controversial. However, we would be seeking to amend it at the second reading stage to get the Australian government to review the status of forces agreement between the US and Australia with regard to codes of conduct and procedures for sexual assault and harassment incidents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There seem to be three legislative mechanisms covering sexual assault by defence forces. The ADF are governed by the Defence Force Discipline Act for offences, including sexual offences, here and overseas; and the United States military forces are covered by the US uniform code of military justice legislation, which includes punishment for crimes such as rape and assault. With regard to transferability between the two, in 1967 both the United States and the ADF drew up <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the SOFA&mdash;the status of forces agreement&mdash;which is a bilateral agreement meant to subject the forces to a clear legal framework for crimes committed and procedures for claims for compensation or damages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a need for a comprehensive legal framework and for prevention strategies to bring justice to women who suffer from assault and harassment by visiting overseas personnel. I suppose, in that case, that it could be for men as well. According to the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, in our region United States military personnel have chalked up an unenviable record in Okinawa, where the abduction and rape of a 12&hyphen;year&hyphen;old was most recently in the headlines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But that is only one of at least 4,700 known crimes and incidents committed by US personnel in Okinawa, including the rape and murder of women.It is also not possible to rule these acts of violence out during training in Australia. We have had a spate of cases of sexual assault in Western Australia which were confirmed by the Western Australian Sexual Assault Referral Centre. This resulted in a visit by senior US military personnel to investigate three sexual assault complaints in July 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legal situation may seem fine and dandy to the forces, but it does not go far enough. Many assaults and rapes that are committed in Western Australia while US forces visit do not get to the prosecution stage. The women complain, but are too threatened by military processes to take the complaint further. The true legal situation has also been questioned in that the military are meant to come under Western Australian laws, but apparently the military have some scope to refer the matter back to military courts where the matter is dealt with internally. And apparently, once the person is back on board, the US military refuse to hand the person over and say that the matter will be dealt with internally. Therefore, the punishments are not transparent or accountable, and there are reported incidents where personnel are docked pay or recreation leave or are delayed promotion for serious offences.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4881">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To circumvent this situation, agencies such as the Sexual Assault Referral Centre in Western Australia have decided to work with the United States military, through the consulate, to develop education and prevention strategies for personnel while they are in Western Australia on visits, recreation leave, and so on. At the moment, this kind of work is irregular because it is based on the will of the particular agencies to do the work. What has been achieved in Western Australia by way of video presentations, talks, leafleting and procedures for passing on complaints of sexual harassments or assaults to senior military personnel has apparently been very successful. Therefore, there needs to be some kind of encouragement of this as a framework to be implemented across all states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has been suggested by some non&hyphen;government organisations and women's organisations is, first, a review of the SOFA agreement to bring it up to date with the changing conditions; second, an enforceable code of conduct for personnel visiting Australia to prevent misconduct; and, third, continuing programs for dialogue and cooperation between state and federal agencies and US military representatives for education and prevention strategies for US military personnel. That explains the rationale and purpose of my second reading amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I move my amendment, I would be keen to hear if there is a response from the ALP because the shadow minister, Mr Bevis, indicated in discussion that he might not be prepared to support a second reading amendment. We went through various stages where what was said was, `It's not usual' or `It's not the right place.' But as I have explained, this bill is exactly about that, and about clarifying the situation&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="FAULKNER " NAMEID="5K4">

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DX5">Senator MARGETTS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is fine. This is exactly the right kind of bill on which to move it, because we are doing the right thing in clarifying the situation of Australian personnel overseas so it is exactly the right place to move an amendment to clarify the situation for visiting US personnel in Australia. The commitment by the shadow minister&mdash;and I <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> hope it will also be given serious consideration by the government&mdash;is to consider the amendment I am moving, but to consider it at a later date by way of a motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So if it is not supportable simply because it is in the bill and because members of the House of Representatives are not as used to amendments of this type in a second reading as the Senate is because, for various reasons, the Senate has a different make&hyphen;up, I am very keen to continue with the debate and move my amendment at a later date in a motion if it does not get support today. I would still love to see it get support today. The world as we know it will not fall apart if what we are doing is carried out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the other comments by Mr Bevis was this. The amendment said, `The Senate resolves that there be laid on the table, by the first day of sitting in 1997, a report.' He said, `You haven't mentioned who the report should be done by.' But I am advised that, under the Acts Interpretation Act, when it is not mentioned who is to produce the report there is an automatic assumption that it is the minister who is responsible for the ministry which administers the act. So the automatic assumption in the amendment is that we are asking for the minister representing the Minister for Defence to present that report to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second reading amendment is asking for an input into the adequacy of the agreement and of current procedures to give an indication of the incidence of alleged sexual assault and of the incidence of sexual assaults that have resulted in award of damages. It is asking for an enforceable code of conduct to implement and improve existing measures. It is asking that the review consider submissions from the public and allow public comment. It does not say that this is what shall be done, that this procedure shall be changed; it is simply asking that a well overdue review take place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are talking about a review that to my knowledge has not been conducted for over 30 years, since the 1960s. Things have changed over 30 years. The amendment was commended to me by the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. I <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4882"> received a phone call from the Armed Services Association. They were dealing with this bill and I assumed that they were saying, `Look, what are you doing moving amendments. We like this bill.'  But no. They rang and I asked them about the bill, and they said that, in fact, they were the people who recommended that the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom should come to the Greens because they assumed that we would be able to give them assistance and put this amendment through in the bill. They thought that it was a reasonable amendment and that it was something that really must be dealt with, if not in this bill now, at some time in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do think that it needs proper consideration. I would like it to be taken seriously and, if necessary, debated with the relevant committees, if that is necessary to have a reasonable debate. I do not think that the world will end if there is a review of these procedures. I move:</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DX5">Senator MacGIBBON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;(1.12 p.m.)&mdash;The government will not be supporting the amendment moved by the Greens on this bill. I really do not know why Senator Margetts is so obsessed about American service personnel raping, looting and burning their way across the Australian countryside. I am not aware that the incidence of criminal activities by American service personnel is any higher than it is for Australian personnel and, off the top of my head, I would think that in both armed forces the incidence of criminal activities is at a considerably lower level, by virtue of their training and their discipline, than it is in the civilian community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I accept that there are breaches of law from time to time by service personnel, because the human race is not infallible and it is not perfect. But we have seen in recent decades a very high standard of discipline and conduct by uniformed personnel when they are on leave and when they are visiting. I think that it is getting it quite out of perspective to equate what might happen in Australia with what might have gone on&mdash;and we have no way of checking those figures&mdash;in Okinawa, or anywhere else. With the greatest of respect, those matters are quite irrelevant to the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My mind goes back to Senator Margetts's predecessor, Senator Vallentine. For months <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4883"> we were besieged with stories about how the incidence of venereal disease was far higher in Perth and Fremantle as a consequence of the American carrier battle groups coming to Western Australia. Ultimately, when the figures were released by the Public Health Department of the Western Australian government, it was found that since the visits had started, there had actually been a decline. So I think that you have got to get some statistical basis for these concerns, senator.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Put succinctly, the bill remedies some of the problems in the Defence Force Discipline Act, and makes attractive changes in relation to the defence home ownership scheme. The amending bill serves to correct a reference in the Defence Force Discipline Act of 1982 to offences against the New South Wales criminal law, to bring the legislation into line with 1992 changes in status of the ACT criminal law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As it has not been explained in any other terms, I assume this amendment is a tidying up exercise, because items 1 to 4 of schedule 1 of this bill make the amendments required. Essentially, the existing section 61 of the Defence Force Discipline Act makes it an offence for a Defence Force member or a defence civilian to do any activity that would constitute an offence against the criminal law of the Jervis Bay territory. There is also a section which ensures that Defence Force members can be prosecuted under the Defence Force Discipline Act for offences committed overseas whilst on deployment or on exercises. Section 61 relates to offences in the Jervis Bay territory. These offences are defined by referring to the New South Wales Crimes Act of 1900. The Jervis Bay Territory Acceptance Act 1915 makes the laws which are enforced in the ACT apply to the Jervis Bay territory. Prior to 1992, the New South Wales Crimes Act 1900 was in force in the ACT and, therefore, in the Jervis Bay territory. Since 1992 the ACT Crimes Act has applied, and the Defence Force Discipline Act was not amended to reflect that change in status to the ACT law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In making this change, the bill also seeks to retrospectively validate any section 61 prosecutions, if any exist, by providing that the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> amendments should be taken to have commenced on 22 May 1992, the date the appropriate ACT legislation commenced. I wonder whether the minister, in summing up, would be able to advise the Senate if she has access to data on whether any section 61 prosecutions will be validated by this retrospective change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also amends the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Act 1990 to extend eligibility, through a change in eligibility criteria, to members previously unable to apply for a subsidised loan. Items 5 to 13 of schedule 1 reduce the period of service required to become eligible for the home loan from six years to five years for either full&hyphen;time or composite service. Further, the definition of eligibility is extended to include members of the reserve forces or emergency forces who complete the requisite training period and are not otherwise covered by the Defence Service Homes Act 1918. Changes made under items 24 to 43 of schedule 1 include increasing the amount of the loan from $40,000 to $80,000 and increasing the maximum amount of loan available to a couple of joint eligibility from $80,000 to $160,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In making these changes, the government is both fulfilling an election commitment and recognising the dedicated service given by defence personnel, and the unique nature of that service. It is also moving to change the existing system in an endeavour to assist in the process of retaining in the Defence Force the services of the very fine group of Australians who presently serve. The previous system was taken up by less than 2,000 people, so it was not a very great success. This scheme should prove much more attractive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a fact that, thanks to the Labor government, there has been a significant slump in morale in the Australian Defence Force, with concomitant high resignation rates. When you have got annual reductions in budgets, reductions in training and exercise time and, above all, continual reductions in staff numbers, reducing the strengths of establishment, then&mdash;whatever you might call those reductions in numbers by glorifying them with titles such as `management initiated voluntary <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4884"> redundancies' or `retirements'&mdash;such reductions have an absolutely devastating effect on people's morale and on their career hopes and ambitions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen, for many years now, annual reductions in the defence budget, and it really has had a most corrosive effect on morale in the ADF. One of the good things about this government is that it has held the line on budget allocations and has given a commitment to do that for the life of this parliament. That stand&mdash;coupled with measures such as the home loan scheme amendment&mdash;will, we hope, mean that there will be a turnaround in defence staff morale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the years, I have expressed here a concern regarding the apparent failure of the Australian Defence Force to imbue its structure with a culture of responsibility and accountability. On too many occasions in the past decade or so, military inquiries have been followed by boards of inquiry, and by further inquiries, until the statutory period under the Defence Force Discipline Act has passed&mdash;a period which, as the Senate will remember, is only three years&mdash;and then nothing can be done about the breach of discipline. Unfortunately, this is a pattern that has become very familiar in recent years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senators will remember that, earlier this year, the Senate committee of inquiry into the Nomad crash reported before we rose for the winter recess. That Senate committee made the recommendation that the period be increased from three years to five years, so that intentional or unavoidable extensions of time in the course of inquiries did not preclude action being taken under the Defence Force Discipline Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would hope that the government is looking seriously at this matter because it is as real today as it was when the Senate report came down. Having said that, I am not for one moment suggesting that there is a problem across the Defence Force where unlawful or unacceptable actions can be performed with impunity&mdash;far from it. I am saying that when actions of a major nature occur, which have unintended consequences, seldom is anyone brought to account for them.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have always maintained that the ADF is a unique organisation, but that uniqueness does not justify there being a lower standard of accountability or responsibility in its operations. In fact, I would argue the contrary&mdash;that, considering the nature of service in the ADF, and the objectives and the commitment of the force to what it has to do, there is a need for higher standards of accountability than in the civilian role. With those words, I wish the bill a speedy passage.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously, I would be very concerned about any amendments delaying this bill which might have the effect of denying ADF personnel access to improved home loans. The opposition will not be supporting Senator Margetts's amendments.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But having said that, let me say on a more positive note that, from the opposition's perspective, I think we would look favourably on giving Senator Margetts an opportunity in the future to debate this motion. I do not say that that indicates a position on the substance of the amendment that Senator Margetts has moved but I think she ought to interpret that as an acknowledgment on the part of the opposition of the importance of the issues that her amendment canvasses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us be clear: I think this second reading amendment crosses the invisible line of those that it is appropriate to debate fully and argue within what has been a fairly broad interpretation of appropriate second reading amendments.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank honourable senators for their contribution to this debate. Of course, as the former shadow minister for defence, it is a matter of great pleasure to me personally to see this legislation coming forward. As Senator Faulkner pointed out, it was a coalition commitment at the last election. I would have been happier still if we had been able to bring it forward earlier than this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Faulkner would well know, having been a minister, the pressures of the legislative program often means that legislation does not come through as fast as you might like. There was an opportunity for this legislation to come through a couple of weeks ago. Unfortunately, the Senate was not in a position to take it through on the Thursday lunchtime. I understand that it is to take effect from the date of royal assent. We hope that that will be very shortly so that the eligibility of defence force personnel to the increased home loans will become available very soon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apart from the increase in the size of the loan, there are two things about the bill that I am pleased about: the reduction in the waiting time for eligibility to five years and, more important than anything for the long&hyphen;term good of the defence forces, the extension of the scheme to reservists. The previous government did talk about the total force concept, but this is one of the great symbols that reservists are part of that total force. It is one force. The extension of the eligibility in a proportionate way to reservists is very important and will be welcomed widely throughout the defence forces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Faulkner also mentioned the ad hoc nature of the introduction of measures out of our policy. Perhaps he is not aware of the fact that funding has already been set aside for the eight 30&hyphen;place child&hyphen;care centres around Australia for the defence force personnel and of another measure which I think is very <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> important&mdash;that is, the spouse employment database. One of the very big problems for defence force personnel is that their spouses find it hard to get employment as they are moved around the country to satisfy the needs of the government and the Department of Defence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator MacGibbon asked about the validity and the need for this amendment. I am advised that there have been 16 prosecutions since 1992 and that the advice from the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department is that those prosecutions were valid. However, Defence, through perhaps an abundance of caution, is proposing that this amendment be included in this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn now to Senator Margetts's contribution and refer to the important matter covered by her amendment. I take her concerns very seriously, as I would as the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women. Violence against women can never be condoned. I would be very concerned to see that Australian women were being subjected to violence which was not being dealt with by disciplinary action or that there were not legal consequences to any such actions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the government considers that the arrangements that are already in place fully address the concerns raised by the amendment. The Australian, United States and other foreign governments take the issue of the conduct of military personnel very seriously and are determined to ensure that the highest standards of behaviour are maintained. The government does not consider that SOFA arrangements in general, particularly the SOFA covering US forces in Australia, fall short of appropriate standards and, accordingly, sees no requirement for those arrangements to be amended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4886"> Senator Margetts flagged that there may well be other mechanisms available to her if she wants to pursue the issue. As Senator Faulkner flagged, the government would not be trying to stifle such a debate, because it is, as I said at the outset, an important issue. We do not believe it is appropriate to amend the second reading motion of this bill; therefore, we are not able to support your amendment, Senator. I thank everybody for their contribu tion and I wish the defence force personnel who are going to be the beneficiaries of this legislation the very best for home ownership.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on this group of appropriation bills and to put forward some views on behalf of the opposition. I will concentrate specifically on matters that relate to education. I begin by indicating that I believe that these bills, in essence, encompass the lies and the broken promises that this government has perpetrated on the Australian public since the election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The broken promises affect all groups in the community. They do not single out any particular group, not the elderly, the sick, the poor, the workers of this country, the unemployed, the social security beneficiaries, the families, or the mothers and fathers of children in child care. They are quite indiscriminate in their abuse of the Australian people, in so far as they grossly mislead the Australian people as to the intentions of this government. These bills bring forward the first tranche of that betrayal. Of course, we expect to see further betrayals in the coming budgets in this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They encompass a hidden package of right wing ideology which assumes that small government is somehow or other the answer to all our prayers and that the private sector is somehow or other the answer to all the problems this country faces. And they are wrapped in the lie that, somehow or other, we are facing massive economic problems which can only be responded to by undermining the rights of Australian people&mdash;rights to services <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and to facilities that they have a right to expect from government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This rhetoric goes to the basic proposition that this government is effectively dominated by a group of free&hyphen;market zealots who are based on the Lyons group that operates as a faction within what we would call the caucus and the H.R. Nicholls Society. This is a generation coming to full flower. We have seen them work on these schemes in secret and acquire little covens all over this country for many years. They get into government and now they have the opportunity to vent their spleen.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AW5">Senator CARR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Conroy points out, they give their mates the odd contract on the way through. What this is really all about is institutionalising advantage and privilege for the few at the expense of the many. This rhetoric of protecting privilege is nowhere more clearly demonstrated than in the education portfolio. In DEETYA, we see that this government proposes cuts across the forward estimates period of $4.3 billion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We hear a lot about these cuts in the higher education sector where we will see cuts of $1.8 billion. We see it in cuts to labour market programs at a time when unemployment is becoming increasingly a social problem in our country. When the demand for government services is growing, we see the retracting of government services under this government. We see it in the schools sector as well&mdash;something we do not often talk about at the national level&mdash;where we see $128 million being taken from government schools across this country and a direct transfer of resources from the public to the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A pattern is emerging from this. In the budget, Commonwealth outlays in relation to DEETYA for the 1995&hyphen;96 financial year were about 11.1 per cent of total outlays. It has been reduced to 10.7 per cent for the 1996&hyphen;97 year, 10.4 per cent for the 1997&hyphen;98 year, 9.6 per cent for the 1998&hyphen;99 year and 9.1 per cent for the year 1999&hyphen;2000. So we have a two per cent drop in overall outlays from DEETYA.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4888">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That indicates quite a substantial and very radical change in government priorities in this budget period. The government is fundamentally shifting priorities away from education, training and employment services. These measures will most severely impact on future generations and most severely curtail their hopes, their aspirations and their opportunities. I have already seen this pattern in Victoria from governments dominated by extreme right wing ideologues.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Grahame Morris has been mentioned as an example of this in terms of the advertising approach that is being presented.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the health system we understand the cuts impact directly on the community. People often respond most acutely to attacks on the health system because people die as a result of cuts to government expenditure. In education, it takes a little while longer, and that is the problem. Nonetheless, the impact is still very dramatic. In social terms it is huge because, as a result of these cuts, we will see that the level of disadvantage for some in our community, and advantage for others, is exacerbated. It reinforces inequality, it reinforces the distribution of privilege and it reinforces the notion that certain people in our society, already wealthy, already powerful, the cream of our society&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;the cream or our society or, as Senator Conroy has said, the rich and thick, will take particular benefit from government actions, while the people that need assistance the most, the disadvantaged in our community, are left to fend for themselves. That in itself is something that ought be condemned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only yesterday we received information about just how dramatic these cuts are in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> student assistance. For example, in an answer to a question on notice from the budget estimates, the department revealed that over one in five students now eligible for Austudy will be affected by the government's budget measures, either by losing the entire entitlement or by receiving a cut in the range of payments. Up to 125,000 students in Australia will be affected by the range of cuts totalling $138 million in the first full year of these particular budget measures. Over a four&hyphen;year period the budget cut will be some $514 million in student education assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Austudy changes go much further. We have seen the allegations based on the fabricated and bogus family presented as the Wright family which was designed by this government to highlight and express all of those most negative attitudes in terms of public opinion about the beneficiaries of public assistance. We had all the allegations about the 5,000 millionaires on welfare predicated on the bogus information presented by Senator Vanstone using the estimates process to propagate a lie and to try to condition the public to assume that the withdrawal of public benefit from Australian citizens was somehow a legitimate process to undertake. About 8,500 Austudy and Abstudy beneficiaries on homeless rates will now lose their schooling incidental allowance. We are talking about homeless people here, not millionaires! Homeless people! In terms of these budget measures, some 2,600 single Austudy and Abstudy beneficiaries who share accommodation will have their rent assistance reduced because of the lowering of the maximum rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I note that this is one measure that does not apply to the halls of residence at the universities. The wealthy graziers of the Western District of Victoria will still be able to pump&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="CONROY" NAMEID="3L6">
<TALK.START>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AW5">Senator CARR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And, of course, Gippsland. I am sure that the great McGauran family of Gippsland will to be able to pump their sons and daughters of the region into the halls of residence and they will be looked after at public expense. But the people where I live, in the northern suburbs of Melbourne, who are trying to cope with the rigours of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4889"> economy at the moment, will not have access to these sorts of benefits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another measure is to raise the independence of Austudy from 22 to 25 years old. That will affect some 12,000 people who will become ineligible because of their parents' assets. We are talking about people who may be as old as 30 and who, under this government, are alleged to be dependants. People as old as 30 years of age being assessed as if they were dependent upon their parents&mdash;an extraordinary measure! We will see the toughening of the actual means test. Not only will 13,000 students be caught under the particular measures that Labor took as a government to ensure that there was a tightening up of the means test, but a further 71,700 students will be affected under the coalition's tightening of the assets tests in relation to the means test for Austudy. This will undoubtedly affect many less than wealthy families, as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And, of course, it is being dressed up as if it were some sort of glorious attack upon millionaires. Nothing could be further from the truth. The Austudy measures are on top of the draconian changes we have seen to HECS. Not only are we hitting students for student support services that are provided by government, but we are also attacking students by charging them higher fees to go to university. And, in terms of ancillary fees that are being proposed under this government, students will pay more for the use of the library, computers, and a whole lot of services that one expects would be part of academic and university life. Then we have charges in terms of the HECS repayments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does that mean for ordinary folk who are trying to use the university system as a means of providing themselves with qualifications? How can we bring pride in this country by ensuring that we have the skilled personnel necessary for us to develop as a nation? Let us look at what this will mean for, say, school teachers. The time taken for them to repay their HECS will increase from six years to nine years. The average amount paid per year will increase from just over $1,600 to $2,400, or about 50 per cent a year in which the payment actually occurs. This will be a gross <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> disadvantage. Given the measures that are being taken by this government to make education more expensive, I would think that many people will have to reconsider whether they undertake studies to gain these sorts of qualifications. These measures provide an advantage to the wealthy: if you are wealthy you can buy a place at the university.</PARA>

It will not be a disallowable instrument in terms of these guidelines regulating what courses universities can charge for. What we will see is that some 17,000 Commonwealth funded places will be withdrawn as a result of these government charges.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is in the area of schools education where the ideological obsession of this government is most evident. The market approach is encouraged and equity is outlawed under its so&hyphen;called broadbanding proposals. The whole concept of the distribution of targeted and quality education programs is removed from the guidelines. In fact, equity is presumed to be some sort of socialist concept. Of course, we cannot have that under this regime of free marketeers!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4890"> The principle of universal free public education is abandoned and our public schools are left to wither on the vine. Hundreds of millions of dollars have been withdrawn from the public sector as a result of the so&hyphen;called enrolment benchmarks and placed with the private sector. I have seen ads in papers in Melbourne recently where Christian fundamentalist colleges are now advertising on the basis of changes to this government's policies. They say in their public advertise ments that, in an effort to attract people away from the public education system and into these particular colleges, fees can now be dropped by some 30 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The abolition of the new schools policy that this government is proposing is but one example of where we will see the deregulation of an industry. It will have dramatic effects on the established educational providers, be it the public education system, which is one I strongly support, or the Catholic education system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me turn to the targeted education programs. Under this government, my state of Victoria will lose some 11 per cent of its funding for the disadvantaged schools program. Also, the Catholic Education Office will lose $1&half; million for its funding in Victoria as a result of this government's proposals. This is a proposition that has much deeper roots than just an attack upon schools themselves. A philosophy is being promoted through this budget&mdash;an ideological obsession&mdash;which seeks to highlight a view of government and society whereby the private sector is good and the public sector is allegedly bad.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me quote from a recent article in the Academy of Social Science newsletter, written by an education academic, Professor Connell, from the University of New South Wales. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We might wonder how a group of businessmen and economists who are rather ignorant of education&mdash;and did little to learn about it&mdash;claim to overturn a generation of educational debate, negotiation and institution&hyphen;building. Yet the National Commission of Audit report of June 1996 is not an aberration. Business intellectuals believe that in the market that they have, almost literally, an answer for everything. The view is that education is mainly a private good, for which individuals should, in principle, pay; that education institutions should be forced to compete with each other, to produce efficiency; that the government provision is an `intervention' in the market which should be reduced, if not eliminated, while private provision is increased.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>These ideas are, of course, vigorously contested by teachers, unions, academic economists and educators. Yet they have enormous influence&mdash;especially within this government, I might add. The deregulation of education, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the abandonment of planning provisions for new private schools and the open slather `compete or die' mentality adopted by this government can only have one consequence: that the rich pay for their quality education while the poor rely on a public sector devoid of resources and strapped for cash. Professor Connell also points outs:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Making the Difference</EMPHASIS> , my colleagues and I found a well&hyphen;developed market articulating ruling class in schools, with the ruling&hyphen;class families who provide their social basis. What families were buying in this market was not an educational service as such&mdash;that was available to them free of charge in the state schools. They were buying an education and social advantage for their children.</PARA>
<PARA>This situation has been most clearly seen in Victoria, where the federal government has abandoned restrictions on new private schools and the new state government is implementing harsh new planning provisions for government schools. We have seen, in recent days, some 113 schools targeted for closure.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I might point out that two&hyphen;thirds of those happen to be in Labor seats, despite the fact that we, in Victoria, hold one&hyphen;third of the seats. The closures are targeted at secondary schools with fewer than 400 students, and at multicampus schools with fewer than 300 students. How do the same provisions apply in terms of the private sector? At best, 60; and fewer than 40, for the primary schools. Only in Victoria is there any provision at all for minimum enrolments, and there the issues are, quite clearly, inequitable.

I am only sorry that we are not being broadcast, because I am told that some 30,000 to 50,000 people listen at any one time to the broadcast, and it would have been good for them to hear that speech. It was vintage Senator Carr. Senator Carr, you run a close second to Jennie George. Next to Jennie George, you really do take the prize for being locked in the Cold War rhetoric of the 1950s.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have not got the time to address, line by line, your ridiculous speech. I dare say that, when you send out, it will be to a very narrow audience. I simply say this to you, Senator Carr: on analysis, what about the Lindsay by&hyphen;election? That really does bury everything you said in your speech. What about the Lindsay by&hyphen;election? Lindsay is pure Labor heartland: John Curtin's old seat in full. You obviously are not hearing the message that came out of the Lindsay by&hyphen;election. Our budget has been accepted. The measures, as tough as some of them are, are being accepted because, for once, there is a strategy behind them, and that is a downward pressure on interest rates.

Just have a look at them, Madam President. The same old crowd.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has allocated $2 million in 1996-97 to support the electricity reform initiatives. This will support the operation of the National Grid Management Council in facilitating the introduction of the national electricity market and allow for corporatisation of the Snowy Mountains scheme by 1 July 1997. The electricity supply industry used to be characterised by poor productivity, over&hyphen;investment and hidden cross&hyphen;subsidies. Electricity is a very important business input, and reducing the cost of power will make Australian firms much more competitive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth and states are, therefore, implementing a range of reforms that will create a genuine national electricity market. New South Wales and Victoria now have competitive markets at a state level. Those states and the ACT will operate as a harmonised market from February next year on the basis of their existing state codes. The states and the Australian Capital Territory will be progressively harmonising their codes and will be introducing integrated dispatch and interregional hedging arrangements by July.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Grid Management Council, under the chairmanship of Mr Landels, has done a great job. He should have a great amount of pride in the development of the national electricity code and in the establishment of two organisations that will run the market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The National Electricity Market Management Company will be located in Victoria. I am sure Senator Ferris will be interested to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> know that the National Electricity Code Administrator will be located in South Australia. This agreement was reached by all the participants. The code will be formally submitted to the ACCC for authorisation as soon as the Senate passes the Trade Practices Amendment (Industry Access Codes) Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge the Senate to recognise the importance of an electricity reform process which will lead to lower electricity prices, reduce greenhouse gases and offer higher levels of service. The question is often raised as to how it will reduce greenhouse gases. In the past, the states were constrained by their own boundaries, as honourable senators will probably know. This meant we had this oscillation from brownouts to oversupplies, and nothing challenged the minds of state ministers more than brownouts. We are now in a situation where there is a surplus of electricity in Victoria and New South Wales and somewhat of a shortage in Queensland.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has always acknowledged that the implementation of the surcharge will involve costs and there has been no debate on that issue. We have consulted widely to ensure the lowest cost option would be implemented. We believe that these costs are minor compared with the benefits which flow from a fairer and more equitable superannuation system. The government believes the overall community compliance cost of reporting will be higher under the alternatives which transfer reporting obligations to employers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is nothing simple or cost effective about the alternative proposals which have been favoured by the superannuation funds. The preferred fund option would lead to yet further imposts on employers and small business. As noted in my speech, employers <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4902"> will be required to modify their current payroll systems.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to Senator Vanstone, the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. Are we correct in inferring from your answer to a question without notice from Senator Carr yesterday that the setting of quotas for government funded undergraduate student places is simply a matter of ministerial discretion? If this is the case, what is there to prevent your successors from succumbing to the ever increasing pressure from universities to make up the shortfall caused by your government's cuts by selling off more places? Have you briefed Dr Kemp on the guidelines you have decided to adopt? After the reshuffle when he is sent in to clean up the mess you have created, what is there to stop him changing your quota to only 70 per cent or 60 per cent of the total places in each course?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Hogg for his question for two reasons. Firstly it gives me an opportunity to repeat what was indicated yesterday. Since there seems to be a pattern in this place of questions either being asked in the other place and then here, or being asked here and then again the next day, let me spell it out for you. Basically what you assert is that the conditions in relation to the sale of places to full fee paying Australian students will be in the guidelines, and that is correct; and the guidelines are not subject to disallowance, and that is correct.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is exactly the same situation as is the case for the fees and regulations covering the sale to Australian postgraduate students, as established by previous Labor governments. That is the first aspect of the question that I choose to deal with. The second is your assertion yet again about our cuts to higher education and that does give me the opportunity to repeat it for you yet again.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Carr is interjecting and saying $1.8 billion. He just cannot face the truth. Universities are not being cut by $1.8 billion and he knows it, but he comes in here and he misleads every day. He has been told before there will be more increases in undergraduate places&mdash;5,000 more undergraduate students. Last time he <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4903"> was told that he took the opportunity to say that it was untrue. I notice he is not doing it today, probably because he recognises that it is true. He has finally caught up with the facts, I suppose. I do notice that he has not come in here and corrected the record, despite the fact that he comes in here week after week and interjects lies and mistruths into this place. He does not bother to come in and correct the record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me repeat it for you again. Something like $680 million over four years will be coming out of university funding compared to something like $20 billion worth of funding being put in over that time. The savings that the government is making with respect to higher education are coming by asking for a higher contribution from students. That is, the people who get the benefit of going into higher education are the ones who are going to have to make a higher contribution. The contribution they are going to have to make is higher simply because they enjoy half the unemployment rate, higher incomes and a better pattern of employment for the rest of their lives. They are not asked to pay as they learn; they are asked to pay as they earn. They do not even have to pay a cracker under our system until they are earning $20,700, and even then it will only be about $12 a week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, in summary, Senator Hogg, the proposals that we have put forward for the reform of higher education are of great benefit to universities and of great benefit to students. The reasons are simply that the cuts to universities are very small. The total government funding per student remains effectively the same. If you judge quality by the dollars per student, there is no drop in quality for that reason. But if you accept that quality can be improved by increased competition, allowing Australian students to buy places, once the government&hyphen;funded places have all been filled, will give another injection of competition between Australian universities to repeat the sort of injection of competition when you allowed international students to come and buy places here. We will also return the HECS contribution from overloaded students, which will be of great benefit to universities <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> who have got some unused space. Those sorts of things will increase the quality of delivery of higher education for Australian students. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></ANSWER>

I myself have visited Social Security regional offices around five states and, on the whole&mdash;in fact, entirely&mdash;in talking to me they have expressed considerable interest in the project because my staff realise that the better the service that goes to the customers, the less distressed the customers are when they actually receive attention from the staff, the less aggression there is and, therefore, a very much better working environment for the staff.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Government assistance through this measure is going to be a great deal more accessible to busy Australians. The new agency is going to have a charter and will have guaranteed standards of service. The public sector will provide a level of service equal to or better than the private sector. It will reduce the complexity which constituents find when they go to receive help and will avoid the waste of time that they currently experience, having to provide the same information to the two departments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are now seeking to find a chief executive who has the necessary skills, expertise and experience for such an important position.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill), to questions without notice asked by Senators Bob Collins and Margetts today, relating to the Jabiluka uranium mine.</PARA>
<PARA>Madam President, I did not hear anything from the minister to indicate that he disputed that the senior traditional owner of the Mirrar people has the authority to make a decision in this regard. The reason the minister did not say that is that he knows that the senior traditional owner, Yvonne Margarula, has the authority to make that decision for the Mirrar people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are parallels here in relation to situations where judges make decisions on whether or not, when a woman says no, they mean no or really mean yes. In this particular case, it could not have been clearer what the response was from the senior traditional owner. If that is the case, then the legalities of that become extremely important. The situation with social impact studies is that over time&mdash;and even the Northern Land Council are very concerned about this issue&mdash;social impact studies have been used by government and proponents to be the vehicle for managing an issue.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4906">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Northern Land Council, in their submission to the uranium inquiry, indicated very clearly that that is their concern. They want to make sure that there is a real commitment in any social impact study so that the views of the people in the Jabiru region are taken fully into consideration. They do not want yet another report done on them. They certainly do not want a report which is a vehicle for a proponent for a later attack.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The interesting thing is that the minister is not committing himself to whether or not he accepts the decision of the senior traditional owner, yet the company does. In a letter to the Northern Land Council, the ERA has said `the company accepts with disappointment your decision'. So the company has accepted that decision. They accept the authority by which that decision is made. The minister is not yet admitting that same authority. He has spoken to the senior traditional owner. He knows that there is no lack of clarity in that decision. To continue without admitting that is a breach of proper process. That whole lack of proper process has been very obvious all through the latest issues with regard to any additional moves for uranium mining by this current government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current new mine at Ranger&hyphen;3 did not go through with the proper environmental impact statement. There may well have been blame on the previous government for giving that approval, but it did not go through with the proper environmental impact statement. This proposal at Jabiluka is not the same proposal that it was before&mdash;it is not the same company&mdash;and therefore it cannot go ahead without the proper approval process. If the minister in any way thinks that is the case, we have to wonder about anything that the minister has said in relation to uranium mining. He has always set the highest levels of environmental standards, but so far all we have seen is shoddy process. So far he has only said that the views will be taken into consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we need to know from the minister right away for the benefit of people who are having their poverty used against them instead of having those things addressed separately from uranium mining is to make sure that the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> minister understands that no means no and find out what his government is going to do in response to relieving that concern and pressure that they are feeling at the moment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak briefly on this issue. The Mirrar people have made their wishes  abundantly clear. Through Yvonne Margarula, who spent time this week speaking with many of us in this place, including the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron), their wishes are very clear. They are united. There is no dissent among the people who own that country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The support goes further than just this particular group of traditional owners. It includes other traditional owners in the area who will also have foisted upon them many of the other impacts that will come from mining. Listening to the people who are promoting this mine as of great benefit to Aboriginal people, the only reasons they give are reasons that relate to the provision of basic services&mdash;services that the territory government or the federal government should be providing for them. Why should people be forced to see their land destroyed and their land mined in order to get basic health services? Why should people be forced to agree to mining in order to get decent housing? Now I hear a Northern Territory government minister suggesting that they have to have their land mined in order to improve the educational opportunities for their children. What has happened to the Northern Territory government and its responsibility to these people?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I was able to visit this part of the country earlier this year I was appalled at the quality of housing that many of these people have to endure. I could find very few benefits flowingd to the community other than some of those benefits provided by way of tourism facilities that will earn an ongoing income for these people. In terms of actual benefits, they are very few and far between. Indeed, if you look at the amount of money earned by the company and the small amount of money that has found its way back into the hands of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4907"> local Aboriginal people, it has been minute, to say the least.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People ask, `If they are going to get economic benefits, why on earth do these people not want their land mined? Surely they can put up with some of their land being mined and get the benefits that flow from it.' In speaking to people, both during my trip to Kakadu and also here, there is a vast number of reasons. Firstly, it relates to wanting to protect their land for environmental reasons, in particular. They do not want further intrusions onto their land. They want to protect their culture. They do not like what they see happening, thanks to the mine that is already there, and they do not want any further intrusions into their way of life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These people believe that the first mine was forced upon those who were speaking for the traditional owners at that stage. They were left with virtually no option but to agree to the mine going ahead. Many of the undertakings that were given then, particularly the undertaking that Aboriginal people will continue to have a direct say in what was happening to their land, have never been fulfilled. In particular, they talk about the lack of contact with the Office of the Supervising Scientist and their inability to get briefings on particular issues, such as the discharge of contaminated water. They had to resort to court action about 18 months ago to stop a release of contaminated water onto their land. Yet they were promised that this simply would not happen, that they would be consulted on an ongoing basis, that they would be kept up&hyphen;to&hyphen;date with what was happening and that they would have free access to data that related to the environmental impact of mining.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you look through the many problems that this mine has caused for the traditional owners, you can well understand their objections. Hopefully, this government will not only listen, as the minister has promised to do, but will actually take notice of what they are saying and act in accordance with the wishes of the traditional owners. There is not just a legal obligation to do so; there is surely a moral obligation on us to listen to the traditional owners. Many of the traditional <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> owners are concerned that this government may be planning to attempt to circumvent the law, change the law and find other ways of forcing&mdash;as they feel that their forebears were forced&mdash;the traditional owners to put up with this mine.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought it appropriate to rise and make a few comments in this debate because I was one of the senators involved in the references committee that visited Kakadu National Park and a number of other sites in recent times. As all senators know, significant contributions were made from a range of Aboriginal groups to that inquiry, both publicly on the record and, on a number of occasions, privately during the afternoon and after hours.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thought it appropriate to put on the record my preliminary observations as this debate goes on and before we trundle off to a range of other sites in the next two or three months. I must admit that the clear impression that I got was that the Byzantine world of Aboriginal politics equals that of the trade union movement. For every 17 persons, there are 18 different perspectives and different views and there appears to be no unanimity and no cohesion in those. I suppose it is no different in that respect from any other organised grouping in our society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that the firm impression that I gained after hearing submissions from a range of Aboriginal groups and their representatives from the Northern Land Council and others is that there is no unity of view. What was conceded both privately and publicly on the record in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> is that there has been a range of developments in that area that have occurred by and large against the will of a range of Aboriginal communities.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4908">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nonetheless, it has occurred in the past and further development is almost inevitable. The groups expressed the view that they were opposed to economic development, to European development, to tourism development, to mining development, to uranium mining development and to any other form of metal mining. But the clear impression that I did not gain was that they were opposed to uranium mining per se, and that was clear from specific comments they made both privately and publicly. They had been opposed to the development and they wished it to cease. However, they also recognised both publicly and privately that the development would occur; and hence their appropriate response, as expressed by the leadership of the Northern Land Council, both in the press and to us privately, was for a range of negotiations to be entered into and concluded relatively quickly so that some of the financial benefits that might be available could be distributed to the Aboriginal people and the Aboriginal communities in those areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They did not want development but it had occurred and it would continue to occur. Their primary position, as expressed by their leadership and my understanding from reviewing the transcript in recent days, is that their best interests were advanced by entering into the negotiating process to gain some benefits for these people.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Bishop made the point that the Aboriginal owners do not want development in their land. He went on to say that they were not concerned about uranium mining per se. I got the exact opposite message in speaking to traditional owners when I was at Kakadu in April this year. Senator Bishop then went on to say that, seeing development is going to occur, we then have to look at the best way in which that can be levied in the interests of the Aboriginal people. There is a loss of logic there. The best interest of the Aboriginal people is for the uranium mine not to go ahead. That is what they want. That is what they made clear to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) in this parliament just the night before last.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the minister's answer today, he said two things. Firstly, he said, `If that was the wish of the Aboriginal people, their wish should be adhered to.' Secondly, he said, `However, we are going on with a whole range of other processes and investigations with a view to having a uranium mine.' There is an inherent inconsistency there and all the alarm bells are ringing. If the minister is going to be honest and straight on this matter, he would be saying that he has now heard the Mirrar people, that he knows clearly from their leaders that this mine is against their wishes and, because he stands for them as the arbiters of this matter, that is the end of it. What is the point of proceeding further down the line? </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4909">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister is trying to dupe not only the Senate but, far more importantly, the people who are involved. We can draw only that conclusion because on the one hand he is saying that he will respect their wishes but on the other hand he is hell-bent on getting around their wishes. What an invidious position to put these people in. At least, it shows a complete inability to understand the anxiety they have. They feel they got rolled in the establishment of the Ranger uranium mine. They know they were deceived by the promises of the goods and the largesse and the improvements in their life that were going to come out of that. They wish that mine had not gone ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now we look at Jabiluka. The people involved there know that it is against their interests. They have had the trial run. They have seen the broken promises. They have seen the broken land. They have seen the broken hearts. They have seen the broken lives. Yet we have a minister saying that he will abide by their wishes: `I know you don't want to go ahead, but I am proceeding anyway.' That is what he is doing. He is proceeding with a series of moves aimed at forcing this mine on that land against the wishes of those owners. It is duplicitous, it is dishonest and it is disgusting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister ought to be ashamed of himself for the way in which he is misleading not only those people. The intent of this government is to foist that mine on them, regardless of their wishes. It is going to be a case of this nation standing with that small group of all mightily important people, their land and their wishes as the government proceeds down that line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This issue will escalate because this minister is hell-bent on escalating it. He is not going to stick with his word. If he were, he would accept the situation now. He would save the further expenditure. More particularly, he would save further heartache for these people. It is a deplorable process that he and his government are engaged in. At least the people of Jabiluka have come here and told him what they think.

They cannot argue with the ship's captain or the owners because it is well known that some of them at least have been thrown overboard during the night for doing so. They cannot stand for themselves.

They will be under threat of fines of up to three&hyphen;quarters of a million dollars for taking action. They lose that power. It means that those ships coming into Australian waters are going to be doing so with little less inhibition on the mistreatment of their workers than they have elsewhere in the world. We are going backwards in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will have quite a bit more to say on that issue when we get to the relevant section in the legislation. As far as the objectives of this bill are concerned, why can't we call a spade a spade? Why can't we say this bill aims to make it easier for the employers in this country&mdash;particularly those with power and a bank of silks, a bank of barristers, behind them&mdash;to advance their position as against those employees who might be without tertiary education, who might not have their first language as English and who might be isolated in their workplace but who know there might be 12 other people in a queue at the door to take their job if they complain or try to get their rights as they have been able to through union representation in the past?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a bill whose objective&mdash;whether its architects know it or not&mdash;is to further divide this country of ours. It is a bill which deserves no amicable reception in this place. It is a bill which ought to be rejected by the Senate, and, if it were not for the Democrats, would be rejected by the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We certainly will revisit the issue at much greater length under the secondary boycott schedule, but I think it is relevant to these amendments, particularly since they concern the International Labour Organisation standards, which we have put back into the bill. I will briefly respond to some of the issues which have been raised today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do want to make the point that secondary boycotts are illegal under the current law, and that situation has not changed. The Democrats' view was that it was a political impossibility to ask a coalition government to change law which had been established by the coalition and the Labor government. Whether this workplace relations bill is passed or not, secondary boycotts by maritime workers, even on environmental grounds, are illegal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Proper concerns have been raised about the ships of shame: ships flying under flags of convenience of countries which do not comply with international maritime working standards entering Australian ports. This issue has been properly raised. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority has wide powers to force ships flying under flags of convenience to comply with international maritime safety standards, including the power to detain ships and prevent them loading or unloading until environmental and safety standards are complied with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year the authority inspected 2,712 foreign ships, with 247 ships having been destined for repairs. Also, it has recently <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4915"> received considerably increased funding&mdash;which is one of the areas in which the government has increased funding&mdash;to enable its inspection services to complete implementation of the recommendations resulting from the House of Representatives <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS> inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats will oppose any attempt to reduce safety standards and conditions on ships in Australian waters. We understand that these issues are in legislation which is separate from the workplace relations bill. It is shipping reform legislation that will be dealt with in due course, and we will support appropriate amendments to it when it comes before the Senate in order to maintain proper standards in Australian shipping.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Maritime Union, as has been outlined correctly by Senator Sherry, have played a very strong role in attempting to get international standards on ships improved and also in trying to make that work, particularly in Australian waters. We have had an approach from them today&mdash;as have all sides of the house, I would hope&mdash;in which they have raised concerns about human rights abuses and their ability to deal with those.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have answered them on matters relating to industrial action, and it is my opinion that those matters have been dealt with appropriately in the bill. But with the human rights abuses, we have asked for a briefing from Minister Sharp. Once we have that advice, we will consider how we should respond on this matter. I advise the Senate that, once we have had that advice, we will come back at an appropriate time.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also just want to raise some matters with respect to Senator Murray's earlier contributions, the first made this morning and the second just then, on the issue of international obligations. As I understand Senator Murray's argument, he says that the amendment they have proposed&mdash;which is the insertion of an object (k)&mdash;is sufficient to cover issues that we are raising and that, therefore, there is no necessity to insert into the objects section the opposition's proposed amendment, which would be to insert the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> words `encouraging the right of employees to bargain collectively'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Adherence to international conventions of course is something that is required by governments who are signatories to those conventions. Australia has a fairly good record in terms of being a signatory and adhering to ILO conventions. The problem, however, as I see it, is that in this legislation there is, firstly, the removal of very important objects that are in the current act which of themselves ensure that the act is directed at protecting employees' rights, whether they be rights with respect to conciliation and arbitration, rights with respect to organisations or rights with respect to award entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If objects in an act are to mean anything, then the people who will be affected by the operation of the act have to understand them. I do not think there is any doubt that those involved in the industrial relations system in this country understand the intention and the impact of the current objects of the act. They have been there for a very long time, and there are numerous legal and other precedents to ensure that people clearly understand what is intended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But here we have a new act which does substantially change the objects, firstly, by the removal, as I have said, of some very important objects, such as the object to encourage the registration of employee and employer organisations under the act. That is something that has been in there since the act, I think, came into force in 1904. So the removal of such an important object sends a very strong message to the participants&mdash;a message particularly, I would say, to the employers that `you are now free to put pressure on your employees not to join a union'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That may not be the intention. But that type of a change, the removal of such a longstanding and fundamental part of the objects of the act, as I have said, does send a strong message. If under the current act, as we have seen in recent years, major companies such as CRA have endeavoured through various means to force people out of unions, to prevent people from negotiating collectively&mdash;if they have been able to run that campaign through their work force&mdash;then, by removing <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4916"> objects such as the one I have just mentioned, they will say that they have a green light to go for broke, and a whole range of other employers will pick up on that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that there is an ILO convention, which Australia is a signatory to, that requires the encouragement of collective bargaining is something that we all in here know and something that industrial relations practitioners know, but it is not something that is generally known by the work force and people out in the country. People do not carry around with them copies of ILO conventions. I do not think that there are too many senators who carry them around.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right; they do not carry around with them acts of parliament&mdash;but they are going to have to carry this one around with them for a while. Given, firstly, that we have the removal of some very important objects and, secondly, that other sections of the act which really carry out the objects have also been neutered, deleted or amended in such a way that the rights formerly enjoyed by trade unions and workers are not only not going to be expressed in the act but also in some cases will be denied to them, it is important on this occasion to make sure that these objects are understood and do not have to be interpreted in the way that they will have to be interpreted if they stay in their current form.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will come back to the issue of section 89A. I have already argued that it is one thing to have an object in the act which refers to resolving industrial disputation by conciliation and arbitration, which is in the current act, but, of course, it is another thing when, in the current act, there is a whole process which ensures that all award provisions can ultimately be arbitrated by the commission. In this bill we have an object, which I accept the Democrats have amended, which relates to conciliation and arbitration of industrial disputes. But then we have another section which severely limits the application and the intention of that object. It does not ultimately leave <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> it&mdash;even as a last resort&mdash;for the commission to arbitrate on all award matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation, as I have pointed out, takes awards that currently exist, and may have existed for many years, rips them in half and takes out a whole range of provisions. That, in my view, is not a process of simplification, which is what was intended and stated to be in the coalition's policy. That is a process of removal by legislation and then forcing employees to go back into a bargaining position to try to get those conditions back&mdash;and not even back into an award.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the employer and employee agreed on a specific provision which, for instance, relates to health and safety in that industry and want to have it in a consent award, they would not be allowed to. They have to have it in some attendant agreement, because the allowable matters do not allow for that.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="COLLINS" NAMEID="GB6">
<TALK.START>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="656">Senator FORSHAW</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is correct. And that is notwithstanding that the parties would like it in a consent award. There are very good reasons why you should be able to have consent awards, and I will be moving to other sections later. Many employers in industries subject to rise and fall clauses in contracts  will tell you that you need certainty. Therefore, quite often they need an award regulation through an arbitral process to enable them to seek adjustment in their prices&mdash;for instance, in relation to wages.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will come back to the ILO position. I have been to the ILO on a number of occasions and have had a fair amount of experience with it in my 18 years in the industrial relations system and working for a trade union. I can tell you that the hardest thing in the world is to get an agreement at the ILO. If you think that we are going to be spending a bit of time in this chamber debating these issues, then note that the ILO will debate the meaning of a word for weeks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For instance, to get any recognition of the term `trade union' at the ILO is virtually impossible. The resolutions that come out of ILO committee meetings and particular industries have to have been agreed to. So <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4917"> you get down to the lowest common denominator, where the workers' groups, the employers' groups and the government groups agree on the terms of a resolution or convention, or whatever it is. They will always use the words `workers' representatives' or `workers' organisations'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have battled and battled to get the ILO to accept that, generally speaking, trade unions&mdash;certainly in the case of free and democratic unions&mdash;are workers' representatives. But they do not like the term `trade union'. It is also the case with the concept of collective bargaining. Getting an agreement at the ILO that it should be a fundamental principle that workers have the right to collectively bargain took a lot of effort. From my experience, it is still not something that employers generally throughout the world actually like. If they can find a way to dodge it, they will.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I would ask Senator Murray to rethink his position on the opposition's amendment. Our amendment will add strength to his amendment which refers to a recognition of international obligations. It actually adds to it. The problem that I have is that if you do not have specific reference to collective bargaining, for instance, or to, as Senator Sherry has said, commitments to better pay, then those who are preaching that these things exist will be the very first who will endeavour to ensure that it does occur.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All right. I just ask you to look at how this has developed. I am going back to the old Conciliation and Arbitration Act, 1 February 1904, which had the objects of the act in section 2. Those objects were ones that fitted in with the constitution in the sense that it talked about promoting goodwill in industry and settling disputes. It kept itself concerned with that particular issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That seemed to continue until the last government introduced the Industrial Relations Act 1988. The act then talked about settling industrial disputes, which promotes the economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia. What the act was saying was, `Look, let's promote industrial peace as a means towards that.' A concentration of the whole act was upon settling industrial disputes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems that what has happened here in these latest proposals is that we have made a quantum leap beyond the attempt to settle disputes in the work place, to make for a happy workplace and to go after all these other things such as low inflation and international competitiveness. I am just wondering whether that opens up such a Pandora's box that it becomes a problem keeping those objectives there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the discussion over the last couple of days is a great illustration of just what will happen. I have not met a lawyer who does not want to get through the case quickly and smartly and directly. What happens is that parliamentarians give them all these words to play with. What else can they do when they are given these things, when these words of wisdom are forced upon them by the legislature, but interpret them in the court? I think that is what is going to happen with this act. There is going to be a long involved process of sorting through these objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was just wondering whether&mdash;I do not want an answer now&mdash;the act wouldn't run <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> more smoothly once it is put through. Wouldn't you save a lot of difficulties before the commission and the courts if you restricted these objects and, indeed, perhaps abandoned them? Otherwise, you are going to get long discussions in court as to whether or not a particular situation promotes international competitiveness and that sort of thing. I know from past days that lawyers are very learned in economics and know all these sorts of things, but even they might take different points of view. What I am really asking is: isn't this very productive of a lot of litigation, which could better be avoided by striking out a lot of these objects and perhaps even abandoning the courts? The act speaks for itself.</PARA></SPEECH>

But the very important difference which I would like to put to the Democrats&mdash;I think perhaps the government is beyond the pale, because they really are seeking to disadvantage all workers&mdash;is that I do believe they are trying to get a result that is fair. The trouble is that the Democrats have accepted the completely passive approach of the coalition, and that is that it is all by agreement. There is no sense of the real dynamic that exists in industrial relations: where people bargain, where they are empowered to argue it out, in many cases being helped by unions; of course, the employers are helped by their employer associations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4919"> That is a fundamental tenet of the system. It is a system that gets over the imbalance of power between the employee and the employ er&mdash;with the natural power that the employer has over the employee&mdash;giving the rights to the individual, that is, the employee, through a collective process. I think this is important because the bargaining process is essential for people who are disadvantaged&mdash;people with poor English, women, and others. People of any type who are not skilled in negotiation need to be helped. The emphasis on bargaining is important. The words `effective agreement' are completely passive and are not acceptable. I do believe that it is naive for the Democrats to go along following the coalition in that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to return to another area where the Democrats have been equally naive, and that is with regard to the other section dealing with the other objective that has been referred to, bargaining collectively, and the implications for the seafaring industry. It is not good enough to talk about the ILO alone, and my colleague has referred to the limitations of the ILO. When we talk about industrial relations on the waterfront, we are talking about very hard people. The people involved, the employers involved world wide, are some of the toughest employers in the world. Seamen and waterside workers on so many occasions over so many years have been prepared to stand up and risk all on the basis of fighting out human rights issues. They have done it time and time again. The Liberal Party, in a previous guise under the leadership of Pig Iron Bob, sold iron ore overseas. There has been case after case. There has been betrayal by the conservatives and the common law experience of workers on the waterfront is that they have always stood up for human rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With that background, it is very disappointing to hear the Democrats' Senator Murray wimp out. He said that the ordinary maritime safety legislation is going to be the way the horrendous cases of disadvantage to seamen who come to our shores from across the world are going to be dealt with. The experience has been that some of the very large employers in international seafaring will take that union on and set out to bankrupt the union.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unless we face up to our responsibilities when we vote on the objectives, we will be <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> allowing the naked power of capital, internationally and in Australia, to dominate. I do not care whether the Minister for Industrial Relations or his parliamentary secretary do not like it. The truth is clear. That is what the government is setting out to do.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two points in relation to that, Senator Cooney. Firstly, your own party&mdash;you may disagree with your party&mdash;has moved a substantial amendment in its own right. In many of its words and sections it is, as I said earlier, in thunderous agreement with the coalition. You mention international productivity, which I know Senator Bishop is concerned about. You mention rising living standards, and so forth. So, Senator Cooney, I presume your previous intervention in the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4921"> debate was speaking against the opposition's own amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The objects of the act, as you would know, do provide a general guide to what the legislation is about. A court may be called on to adjudicate on a matter arising out of the operation of the act and, in so doing, may be required to determine the meaning of a provision in the act. If the court considers that in taking account of the wording of the provision alone its meaning is unclear or ambiguous, the court will take into account the objects of the act as an aid to the interpretation. I think you would have known that already. The coalition clearly would like to see these objects included in the act. We think they are important, and we wish their con sideration by this committee of the whole a speedy passage.</PARA></SPEECH>

What has happened is legislative creep. I am not too sure when objects were first put into the act, but they were very modest objects when first put in. But now it seems&mdash;I used the word `parliament' advisedly before&mdash;that the legislators seem to be intent upon putting most policy statements into an act which has to be interpreted, and I am not sure whether it is a wise thing. Perhaps we can get some information about when objects were first put in, what the basis of that was, and why we have suddenly, as a parliament&mdash;I do not want to be party political about this, Senator Campbell&mdash;launched forth to encourage, as it will, advocates to give tribunals and courts lectures on economics, social policy and all sorts of other things that I think we as legislators would be better able to deal with. That is what worries me a bit. I am not sure whether we can get any help on that as to when these objects were first put in&mdash;when objects of any sort were first put in.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to take up a contribution from Senator Murray. He is, unfortunately, not with us at the moment. We do not have a Democrat representative here, but nevertheless I know that what I have to say will be listened to. I refer to paragraph (e), which says that the object of this act is to provide a framework of rights and responsibilities for employer and employees in their organisations which supports fair and effective agreement making. What about the plight of those seafarers coming into Australia who, when they come under the umbrella of Australian law, have no rights when it comes to agreement making.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Murray said that he would consult with the Minister for Transport and Regional <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4922"> Development (Mr Sharp) on the matter and come back to the Senate on it. That raises two important things about these objects if they are to be carried out and true, and if the designers of the legislation are going to stick with them. Are the Democrats going to insist on an amendment to the legislation if it infringes these objects&mdash;if it is found that those seafarers are left unprotected under this legislation, as the Maritime Union say they are? I am concerned that after such a long piece of negotiation, the Democrats do not in fact know the answer to that. They are assured that the ships will be safe&mdash;they will looked over and their seaworthiness will be ensured&mdash;but they do not know about the human beings aboard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The maritime unions have an extraordinary and meritorious record in this country of looking after those interests. That is where we all ought to be alarmed that this legislation is disempowering those unions to continue that job. If that is the case, we are moving to a situation where we will also be removing the protection for people under the law in this country to ensure that their rights, their freedoms and their ability to not only make agreements but also have the employers honour those agreements are not taken away by this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we have an objective set out here, but the reality is that the bill is doing the exact opposite to the objective. It is internally inconsistent. We ought not, as a house of parliament, allow for that contradiction. I think we should have the facility to come back and amend this set of objectives, if Senator Murray finds that the Maritime Union's ability to protect seafarers in Australia is being trammelled. It is a very serious point that has been raised by the unions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am concerned that the Democrats were apparently not aware of this problem. I am concerned that after the agreement has been struck, advice now has to be sought from the minister. But I am much more concerned that, on the public record, Senator Kernot has indicated that they have signed a document which binds them to the provision of this legislation. I ask, through you, sir, what the Democrats are going to do if they find that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this appalling change of fortune for seafarers coming to this country is, in fact, embodied in this legislation and the government says, `But we're not going to change it because we're out to get the unions, particularly on the seaboard of this country.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the bargaining power for Senator Kernot in that situation? Has she or has she not signed away her right to rectify what is manifestly a very great wrong being perpetrated on not 10, 20 or 100 but thousands of seafarers who will come to this country over the decades to come? Are we returning not only to the `ships of shame' situation but also to a deliberate trammelling of the process whereby maritime unions have been able to come to the aid of those people? On a raw reading of it, if they exercise the power they need to to pull up the flag of convenience shipowners and their captains, they could face a three&hyphen;quarter of a million dollar fine for taking such action. It would put them out of business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We would end up with a situation that apparently pertains in New Zealand where the best the unions can do is say, `I hope your ship is going to Australia because over there they have not yet got the draconian industrial relations legislation that we have in this country which ties our hands. The best we can do is picket.' Is that going to be the situation pertaining in this country after the passage of this legislation? If it is, the Democrats have an invidious responsibility on their shoulders to change it now, to know exactly what they are doing as far as this legislation is concerned. I do not care whether or not Senator Kernot has signed on the dotted line: honour says she must put the plight of those people before that hasty signing of a document&mdash;a signing away of her rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I appeal again, through you, sir, for the Democrats to look closely at the objects of this bill and make sure that they are fulfilling those objects as laid out and, in fact, have not signed an agreement which does the exact opposite to what, in particular, object (e) in this bill purports to do.</PARA></SPEECH>

Nations certainly do compete but there is no such thing as international productivity. It is a domestic concept related to domestic economies. During the luncheon debate, I took the trouble to get some information from the Department of the Parliamentary Library and they advised, on the June figures to this year, that 16 per cent of GDP production in this <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> country relates to the export of goods and services and 84 per cent relates to domestic production.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the basis that 84 per cent of our production is related to the domestic economy and the overwhelming majority of our export GDP relates to capital intensive industries, how does any emphasis at all on international competitiveness in the domestic economy result in higher employment, improved living standards or low inflation?

Anyone who works in the domestic economy creating goods and services to be consumed domestically is, even though Senator Margetts would like it to be different, competing as far as import replacements go.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it very hard, but I am beginning to understand why the Labor Party in government had problems. If a parliamentary secretary has to stand here and explain to the opposition what productivity means, what international competitiveness means and what higher living standards mean, I think the people of Australia can begin to understand why you made such a hash of industrial relations when you were in power, such a hash of the economy and such a hash of employment, and cost millions of people their living standards.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4925">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is committed&mdash;it is in this bill&mdash;to higher living standards, international competitiveness, productivity and more productive and effective workplace relations. I thought you backed those concepts by proposing opposition amendment No. (1), which backs all of those concepts. If the meaning of any of those words are unclear to you, I strongly recommend that you go up to the library with Senator Bishop. There are lots of good books on international competitiveness. There are lots of books about how you measure it, lots of debate about it, lots of discussion about it and lots of discussions about the concept of pay. Most of the papers that are coming out now say that international competitiveness has very little to do with pay rates; it all comes down to effectiveness and efficiency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said to Senator Bishop, if your objective is to stay here until 7.20 p.m. and have a discussion about productivity, international competitiveness, living standards, various measures of it and what the impacts are, it is a fascinating debate, but it has very little to do with getting into the core sections of this bill, which Senator Sherry has assured us we will get to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If your objective is to fill the time between now and 7.20 with these sorts of notions, I guess it will be an interesting debate, but it has very little to do with the details of the bill. In fact, they are not contentious because, Senator, your party has agreed&mdash;I presume at its caucus&mdash;even though you do not seem to have moved this amendment yet. Maybe you are backing off from it. All of these words are actually agreed. They are entirely non&hyphen;contentious because they are in your own amendment. The Labor Party amendment No. 1 reads:</PARA>

<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">All of those matters are non&hyphen;contentious. If you have so many problems with them, I have made a suggestion to Senator Mackay: go to Senator Sherry's office at lunchtime and cross them out with crayon. She was going to cross out `the pursuit of high employment' because <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> she is backing off from that. Labor does not want high employment as an object of its industrial relations system in Australia. You do not want `productivity' and Senator Bishop does not want `international competitiveness'. Borrow Senator Mackay's crayon and go to Senator Sherry's office, maybe at afternoon tea time, and cross it all out. Tell the Australian people that you do not want the industrial relations system to have those objects. We do but, if you do not, do not proceed with your amendment.

Instead, when we looked at the various elements of the principal object, like the ALP we realised that, rather than try to make individual amendments, the best thing to do would be to rewrite a new principal object. Therefore, that is what we have done.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have proposed an alternative clause that is based on the existing object clause in the Industrial Relations Act. Our amendments to that clause include: firstly, the promotion of industrial harmony, which is certainly a part of Greens policy through and through; secondly, encouraging a high level of consultation between employers and employees and their organisation, which likewise is very much part of Greens policy; thirdly, deletion of the reference to the desirability of reducing the number of organisations in an industry or enterprise; fourthly, encouraging employers to provide employees with access to training and career path planning; fifthly, encouraging and promoting collective bargaining; sixthly, incorporation in the discrimination clause of workplace harassment and extension of the clause to incorporate people with a transgender identity; seventhly, the incorporation of the goal of satisfying work for all employees; and, eighthly, the incorporation of a note with respect to Australia's international obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the last point, it is important that we do not just see something as meeting Australia's international obligations without having some idea of what they are. So we have mentioned those relevant obligations, agreements and commitments Australia has made in the object of the bill, and that is set out there in the note following our new principal object.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do believe those objects, such as prevention of discrimination and prevention of workplace harassment, are important in the object. Part of getting a fairer Australia and a more productive Australia that is meeting people's needs is through actually making sure that, as far as possible, workplaces are in harmony and groups of people are not singled out for poorer treatment than other workers, for whatever reason.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to commend my amendments to the Senate. I hope this can be seen as a model instead of a narrow viewpoint that somehow or other we will translate economic rationalism&mdash;or irrationalism, as I call it&mdash;or economic fundamentalism and put that in as the object of the workplace relations bill. Instead, we should be seeing what it is we are hoping to achieve in the workplace. This is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4932"> what I think we should be hoping to achieve in the workplace so we do actually have a more productive workplace with better outcomes for all people involved.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The approval function follows on from the amendments to schedule No. 11, which will allow the Employment Advocate to approve AWAs where there is no doubt that they fulfil the `no disadvantage' test. This ability to approve clearly above&hyphen;award agreements will allow a fairly simple administrative procedure to formalise the largely unregulated above-award contracting already going on in most small business workplaces. It will be quite clear that any AWA which looks doubtful will be referred to the AIRC in accordance with a protocol developed by the President of the AIRC with the concurrence of the advocate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The three considerations that will be added to 83BB place a heavy onus on the Employment Advocate. The importance of these provisions will become apparent as we move through schedule 11&mdash;that is why I make reference to them now&mdash;particularly in relation to judgments that the advocate has to make about the bargaining process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amended bill will contain a wide range of protections of the bargaining process, including a requirement that all AWAs include appropriate provisions on discrimination; the requirement that the AWA is offered to all comparable employees in the same terms as should fairly or reasonably be offered the AWA; the requirement that the employer explain the effect of the AWA to the employee; and, most importantly, the requirement that the employee generally consents to making the AWA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The considerations will also be important in the development of the information statement, prepared by the Employment Advocate, which all employers will be required to give to employees prior to signing the AWA. The considerations will also be important in the general assistance provided by the Employment Advocate to employees and employers, particularly in relation to representation for breaches. This also relates to proposed <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 83BB(2)(c), which carries a very pro&hyphen;active function&mdash;the requirement for the advocate to actually promote better work and management practices and to do that through AWAs.

Amendment 5 provides for an appeal to the commission in relation to the determination by the Employment Advocate on free legal representation. Amendment 7 prevents the Employment Advocate from delegating its powers and functions in relation to prosecution, inspection and assessment of breaches of AWAs or contraventions of part VID or part XA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On amendments 4 and 5, as I have said on a number of occasions, it is really quite important that, if you have agreements&mdash;and they really are agreements&mdash;and there is no bargaining that is actually part of the bill, and those so-called agreements are broken by the employer, the employees have at least the ability to access a remedy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If companies have the ability to use their wealth to use the law against or intimidate employees, then it is hardly a fair contest. We think that, if people have a case that needs to be answered, they do need to have access to legal representation. If that is not available, then I guess it has to be admitted that are not dealing in any way, shape or form with anything like a level playing field. Both the ALP and the Greens have admitted that we do not see that this is any way, shape or form a level playing field. But if there is no access to legal assistance, then what we have is a farce.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment 7, as I have mentioned, prevents the Employment Advocate from delegating its powers and functions in relation to prosecution, inspection and assessment of breaches of Australian workplace agreements. What on earth is going to happen if we have <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4936"> this precedent set, perhaps again and again, of delegating out prosecution? Who eventually is accountable for administering a law in that sense, to the point of prosecution, if those powers can be delegated out? I do not think it is appropriate that we have an Employment Advocate delegating those powers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The perception of bias or the perception of corruption cannot be far from the surface when such important powers are delegated out. We believe it should also not include the delegation of powers of inspection, assessment of breaches of AWAs or contraventions of part VID or part XA because, basically, you can certainly delegate out advice functions. We look at that in our amendments. There are, I believe, not enough people around within the Employment Advocate to actually provide the full advice that we think is going to be necessary for all of the people who are going to need assistance with Australian workplace agreements. The assessment of breaches as a delegated function, I think, is not appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, I would urge the Senate to support Greens' amendments 3, 4, 5 and 7 because, if there is any semblance of access to remedy, at least we have to see whether or not there is any support for providing the resources for that. If the argument is that we have only provided $2.9 million for staffing for the Employment Advocate, you will have to ask: how will that assistance be available? If that Employment Advocate is, as has been mentioned, an employer advocate, how do you divide $2.9 million worth of staffing resources so that you really do provide&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to amendment No. 4, the onus on the advocate under the proposed bill to provide representation is already very high. The amendment, in our view, pushes that onus much too high. The fact that we are providing pre-vetting of agreements before they take effect to some extent reduces the need a little for representation, and we think the limited discretion in (g) should be retained. Indeed, the amendment could have the unintended consequences of removing resources from the advocate's important approval and vetting roles to representation. So we oppose that amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment 5, schedule 11, will provide that doubtful AWAs will be referred to the AIRC. We have also expanded the right to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> bargaining agents to appear in hearings. Given the higher approval conditions set down and the limited discretions given to the advocate, we do not believe that this amendment or the appeal is necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are opposed to amendment 7.

Perhaps you will be able to enlighten us, but it does say, `1996&hyphen;97'. Obviously, there will be different salary outcomes based on when this starts in the 1996&hyphen;97 year, and, obviously, `Running costs' and `Other' does not relate to salaries.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These issues are very pertinent to the questions of what kind of remedy and assistance is available to people on Australian workplace agreements. The Employment Advocate has been used so often in the debate by the government as the means by which we can be assured that decency and fairness&mdash;and whatever other words have been thrown around&mdash;can be attained.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The reason I am asking these questions is that we are going to get to the stage of finding this bill rammed through by agreement. So how long will it take before the first  people are lining up at a door that does not exist yet to get assistance?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The kinds of questions I am asking in relation to my amendments are: roughly how many people can you assume will be available around Australia to assist them? If our figures have been wrong, perhaps let us know because does it mean that there will be coverage in regional Australia? Does it mean that each state will be covered in some way?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> We assume that, when royal assent of this bill has been given, the individual contracts will start coming in, like the situation in Western Australia. Hamersley Iron was ready on the knocker when the Western Australian legislation came through. So we are not talking about something in the dim, distant <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4939"> future or something that might start occurring some time after a bill goes through because the evidence is clearly not that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The evidence clearly is that those companies which would like to access the ability to put their workers on Australian workplace agreements are not going to be waiting until royal assent for their preparation. They will be ready on the knocker. A number of corporations and companies&mdash;a whole load of businesses throughout Australia&mdash;will be ready on the knocker for whenever this bill comes into law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Therefore, if there is no real idea of what kind of numbers of actual people in places will be available, then any assurances we are given about the Employment Advocate are going to seem rather hollow. What will be the situation if, after this bill has gone through and whenever it is likely to get royal assent, we do have a line&hyphen;up of people who do not know where they can go or, worse still, you do not know where they can go to get that assistance which you claim will be the linchpin of fairness for Australian workplace agreements.

Given that the Employment Advocate will take on a sort of inspectorate role in relation to AWAs, I wanted some advice as to what is to occur to the section of the department which used to do the inspectorate role in terms of awards. I think it has most recently been called awards management section. I wonder if you can indicate whether or not the department will continue to play that role as inspectorate in terms of awards in the same way it has in the past, and whether or not its resources are going to be downgraded in order to provide inspectorate services within the Office of the Employment Advocate?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I understand the proposition, the Employment Advocate will take on inspectorate&hyphen;type services for the monitoring of AWAs. The debate we have been having has been about whether the allocation of funds is going to be sufficient for that task. I, like Senator Margetts, have some concerns about that proposition, because I think we found last time the coalition went down this path in the 1970s that the structure they set up to replace trade unionism in the Industrial Relations Bureau failed to meet that task of monitoring, inspecting and enforcing awards.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just following that through, I would have thought that, if the bill is ultimately passed, the act would empower and direct the Employment Advocate as to his duties in a very broad sense. I am extremely curious, given the answer, as to what directions might be given which are not already in the act. I would have thought that there is already direction in the objects of the act, if the objects ultimately become part of the act, to look after these specially disadvantaged people, or other classes of people, that you suggest might be considered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the concern that this provision generally raises&mdash;I take note of the comments of Senator Murray about them perhaps being administrative&mdash;would be better contained in relation to administrative instruction. Certainly, I would take it that the powers which would be vested in the Employment Advocate under the act would be subject to the financial provision by  government for services. That will be a matter, as I understand it, proposed to be the subject of annual reporting to the minister and to the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Otherwise, I fear the circumstance will arise, as it has done with similar aspects of the industrial relations law in Tasmania, where there is provision for the minister, and only the minister&mdash;outside of the parties to an enterprise agreement in that state&mdash;to intervene in proceedings. In the case of the minister not intervening by regulation in a particular matter, the minister is open to criticism because he or she is the only person who can intervene.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you follow this process of having to be gazetted, the steps which would need to be taken for the minister to intervene in any <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> matter may well occur after the actions that the minister wanted to intervene in had taken place. It would seem to me to be a particularly clumsy aspect of this bill. It seems also to me to be drawn from other examples. My only experience of a similar example was an utter failure. I think that was evidenced in the evidence that the committee took when it went to Tasmania about the operation of the industrial relations legislation there and the complaints that the former enterprise commissioner made about the non-intervention of a  minister in those circumstances.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To go back to the earlier point of your discussion, the functions are well and truly enumerated in the bill, as you would have read. This is a way for the minister to direct the Employment Advocate, particularly in an area where there was a need. For example, if you or another honourable senator were to come into the place in a couple of years and say, `Look, this is an absolute disaster; you said in the Senate two years ago, Senator Campbell, you were going to look after disadvantaged young Aboriginal people and there are examples all around the north-west of Australia or Queensland where they are not getting access,' the minister could create such a direction to ensure that the Employment Advocate assisted those people.

The particular section says:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>It does not say that the minister will be able to direct the Employment Advocate as to those people he or she will help or in what direction he or she will do it. It really goes to the issue of the machinery provisions as to how he is to carry out the particular objectives. It does not, as I read it, in any way deal with the objectives to which the Employment Advocate may direct his efforts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even if this section does allow the minister to direct the Employment Advocate as to where he or she might best place his or her efforts, does it not, as has been said, give the minister an overriding power? No doubt he or she would normally exercise it properly, but I doubt whether the minister would be the one who would be exercising the power. Does it not give those who in fact exercise the power the ability to pick and choose between those who may be helped and those who may not be helped? As has been pointed out before, does that ability that has been given to the minister not take away&mdash;to a significant extent in any event&mdash;the ability of the Employment Advocate to act independently?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA>It is the Greens' belief that, if the Employment Advocate is to be effective, it must be independent of government and ministerial direction. In the aftermath of this move to individual contracts, an effective independent source of advice and assistance is absolutely essential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Industrial relations law is complex even for those with a reasonable grasp of law and the industrial relations system. If an illiterate worker is given a contract by a prospective employer, they need to have the confidence to turn to an organisation such as a union or the Employment Advocate for advice that is seen to be independent of government interference. This was highlighted by the National Pay Equity Coalition in their submission to the committee. They stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Employment Advocate is not independent. The Employment Advocate can be directed in carrying out his or her functions by the minister and the staff are public servants provided by the secretary of the Department of Industrial Relations. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4944"> </PARA>
<PARA>We received what were intended to be assurances by the parliamentary secretary who said, `Don't worry; they will be from the Department of Industrial Relations.' But I do not think that necessarily helps. The provision that the Employment Advocate can be sacked for `incompetence and inefficiency' is another control mechanism. The submission concludes the section about the independence of the Employment Advocate by stating:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The role can have no credibility while it is subject to direct ministerial control and direction</PARA>
<PARA>Amendment No. 6 simply omits section 83BC and replaces it with a new section 83BC `Independence of office' which simply states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Employment Advocate is not subject to control or direction by the Minister.</PARA>
<PARA>Amendment No. 10 is a consequential amendment which deletes the reference to annual reporting of ministerial directions under section 83BF. If our amendment No. 6 is successful, the minister will not make any directions and therefore will not need to be reported to. I think it is reasonable if there are firm statements of goals for an Employment Advocate that that office is able to carry out those functions. I do not think it will be necessary for the minister to say, `Operate in this office or operate in that.' If there are firm functions, then, as a so&hyphen;called independent advocate, it should be possible for that responsibility to be taken, providing those goals are clearly stated, and the need will direct the operation, I would assume. I cannot see that ministerial directions in this sense, or having people operating under the direct control of the minister, will be of assistance in creating that independence which I think will be necessary.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA>These amendments relate to the delegation of the Employment Advocate's advice role to community based advice centres. As indicated earlier, the advice role of the Employment Advocate is going to become increasingly important with the advent of individual contracts. The Greens propose that this advice function would be most appropriately delivered by community based groups, such as working women's centres and others, and that the Employment Advocate should be able to delegate that role to such groups and remunerate them accordingly. The National Women's Justice Coalition made the suggestion in their submission to the committee and stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If, as a result of these major changes, individuals are to be left to enforce their rights, public education about rights at work must be undertaken. In this context we note with disappointment the abolition of the Outworkers Entitlement Campaign which would have informed particularly isolated workers of their basic rights, especially those from a non-English speaking background. Employees will also need access to independent advice services to help them understand their entitlements and enable them to negotiate appropriate pay and conditions. We recommend that the Working Women's Centres and the Women's Legal Services should be involved in the provision of information, education and advice and should be properly resourced for this purpose.</PARA>
<PARA>Amendment 8 allows for the delegation of these roles by the Employment Advocate and amendment 9 requires the reimbursement of reasonable costs to those community based centres. It is my understanding that there will not be sufficient staff available at the Employment Advocate to provide that advice. If that Employment Advocate is operating for both <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4946"> the employee and the employer, then it seems reasonable that people should be able to access advice that they can feel comfortable with in relation to Employment Advocate services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are people who are already providing that kind of advice&mdash;they are already very strained in their ability to provide the services that are being required of them even now&mdash;but it does not seem unreasonable if, in reality, people are seeking independent advice and are directed to these other sources of independent advice that those sources be able to access resources and some form of remuneration for the service they are providing. That is why I am commending amendments 8 and 9.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If as an outcome of the bill, which is likely to be passed, we are going to put a great deal more pressure on people providing services, I believe it is reasonable that those services be at least adequately resourced.

It is important that the officers of that body have appropriate skills to deal with vulnerable workers. The National Pay Equity Coalition also highlighted this issue in their submission. They stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Employment Advocate should be required to ensure staff are adequately trained to provide <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4947"> advice and information for members of disadvantaged groups. Provision will have to be made for translators to be employed and/or funded and for Employment Advocate services to be widely available at the local level perhaps through contracting with youth organisations, working women centres, migrant resources centres or youth access centres, et cetera.</PARA>
<PARA>Amendment 11 deals with the need for authorised officers to have received or be receiving training in the provision of advice to disadvantaged groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment 12 deals with the need for authorised officers to have appropriate language skills. We realise this training might not be able to be right on the knocker should this bill come into force. However, it does not seem unreasonable that those people who undertake that role should be in the process of receiving training to make sure they are able to handle those requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is obviously the people from the most vulnerable groups who have these greatest concerns. They want to know that there will be recognition that this last line of defence, the Employment Advocate, is going to be not only possibly able but able to handle properly these kind of concerns from the most disadvantaged groups who are already being shown to be disadvantaged by enterprise bargaining, let alone what we are likely to see under individual contracts under the Australian workplace agreements. I commend amendments 11 and 12 to the chamber.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do think I need to make a comment in relation to Senator Murray's statements. So far awards have been put together in a certain way, with the negotiation of unions, in Australia. However, where there has been negotiation and agreement up to now is in relation to the 1993 industrial relations bill, which allowed for enterprise agreements. In the 1993 bill it was the Greens also who, amongst others, were calling for the ability of those people in the work force without English as a first language and who were in a minority in the workplace to be taken into consideration. We were out there batting for the same groups of people back in 1993.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to say that there were some improvements in the 1993 bill for enterprise agreements. It is not sufficient to say that the awards management branch does not have those skills and requirements. Awards were quite different from, firstly, enterprise agreements, which did end up with some changes which allowed for checking to make sure that minority groups within an enterprise agreement were satisfied and understood the conditions .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, what we are dealing with here is individual contracts. That makes it much more important in relation to those skills being available than was the case under awards, because at least with the awards people knew what they were up for. They did not have to individually fight the system. They did not have to individually negotiate their own agreement. That is what the difference is, and that is why it is even more important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think it is sufficient to say it did not exist under the awards management branch, because this is a whole new shooting match.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer now to government&hyphen;Australian Democrat amendment No. 14, which proposes new section 83BT. This, in our view, is a very important provision. It makes it clear that the Employment Advocate can publish and make available copies or extracts from AWAs and ancillary documents provided the identity of the parties is kept secret. Obviously the EA would have to have regard to the right of the privacy of the parties in accordance with established privacy principles, but this would be balanced against the important public interest considerations in ensuring that appropriate bodies, such as HREOC, have the information to track what is happening in the labour market and whether it is fair. Salary comparisons are particularly important in determining whether equal remuneration or equal pay principles are being applied.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment fits the requirements set out by the unions, ACOSS, HREOC and the Senate inquiry that the content of AWAs must be capable of research and analysis to ensure that trends in bargaining are tracked.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to be very brief because I do not want to make a comment when we get to a broader debate in opposing this section later on. I am surprised you say, Senator Murray, that this is a very important amendment when the word `may' is in there. If it was the word `shall', I could understand. But the final decision about the publishing of anything is left with the Employment Advocate. The Employment Advocate decides that if he or she is not going to publish then they are not going to publish. Again, we do not see, frankly, that this is much of an improvement other than that `perhaps some information may be published'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You raise the issue of the researchers. They may not get access because of the word `may'. If you wanted to limit it purely to researchers for publication and some overall evaluation of the worth of AWAs, why not have the word `shall' in there and some quite specific provisions in relation to access for researchers as matter of right? We certainly do not see anything significant or very important about the word `may' when the Employment Advocate can still do what they like.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for the broader issue of secrecy provisions, we vehemently oppose them and I am sure we will make much more comment about that later on when we get to award matters.

<PARA>We are reconsidering schedule 3. That is the procedural process we have to go through in order to deal with the amendments that we have circulated. As I indicated earlier, we are fundamentally opposed to the creation of the Office of the Employment Advocate and my colleagues will outline a range of their concerns about the creation of this position and the associated officers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe the Employment Advocate is totally ill-conceived and unnecessary. In fact, it reminds us in many ways of the old Industrial Relations Bureau.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="FORSHAW" NAMEID="656">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="656">Senator Forshaw</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It's just as faulty.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. One of my colleagues will comment in greater detail about the old IRB, but it certainly seems to us <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4953"> that this is the recreation of the old IRB in another form.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe the Employment Advocate is ill-conceived because it has potentially conflicting functions of advising and representing both employees and employers, and I am sure my colleagues will draw the Senate's attention to the areas in which that conflict occurs. It is unnecessary because all the proposed functions of this new Employment Advocate can be, or are, performed by the Department of Industrial Relations. We had an example of this earlier when my colleague Senator Evans and others asked questions about the budgeting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We already have the Department of Industrial Relations providing advice and assistance about awards, AWAs and investigations into breaches or contraventions. Why set up another bureaucratic organisation&mdash;I do not use the term `bureaucratic' as a form of abuse&mdash;a dual purpose organisation, a second organisation, when we already have an effective operating organisation in the Department of Industrial Relations?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recall the rhetoric of the government in the lead-up to the last election&mdash;certainly, for years preceding that&mdash;complaining about bureaucratic overlap, duplication and additional costs. As we touched on earlier, the Employment Advocate will cost $12 million in the first year. We do not have the budget details for subsequent years, but it will certainly be substantial. Why this added cost?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> As a matter of observation, we have heard complaints from the government about the enormous size of some of the acts. We often had reference to the various tax acts in respect of their expanding nature, their detail and of hundreds of pages being added. As a consequence of this whole range of amendments, we will be adding to the industrial legislation. As a matter of principle&mdash;for reasons we have outlined and will continue to outline&mdash;we just do not believe it is an appropriate approach. The commission files AWAs. Why are we creating another organisation to overlap? The Employment Advocate that is proposed is also flawed, because it will provide free legal representation only where it considers this <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> would promote the enforcement of the provisions of the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Margetts, in her questions earlier, raised the issue of what the budget allocation will be in respect to people who want to access it. We do not know what it is going to be at the moment. Knowing this government's performance with respect to budget matters&mdash;we have already seen it with legal aid&mdash;there will not be sufficient moneys allocated even in the restricted form in which it is proposed under these provisions. We also have the additional problem of its independence being compromised because it is subject to ministerial direction, albeit we now have a disallowable instrument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In our fall back amendments that have been circulated we create another body called the Employee Ombudsman. That is obviously not our first priority. That Employee Ombudsman is to provide advice, assistance and representation to employees only. The provisions concerning the Employment Advocate are amended so that it will provide advice and assistance to employers only. So we eliminate this conflict of interest embodied within the government's schedule 3. Also, the Employment Advocate that advises employers will be able to represent small business employers. We also provide for free legal representation that is not subject to any qualification, and we ensure that both bodies are completely free of ministerial direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In briefly outlining some very fundamental concerns about the Employment Advocate and in outlining our proposals, my colleagues will make contributions about specific areas of their own concern. But I would like to draw the Senate's attention to the report of the Senate Economics References Committee and quote Senator Murray again&mdash;surprise, surprise! Page 343, under the heading `Office of the Employment Advocate', states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats do not agree with the conclusion of the Majority report on the role of the Employment Advocate, although we share the concern that the role and the independence of the Office are not properly refined in the bill. Professor Ron McCallum argued that the office is being given two largely incompatible roles of advising employers and employees on AWAs and investigating breaches. He concluded that these two roles would be <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4954"> difficult to operate together. He advocated the adoption of the Employee Ombudsman model from the South Australian legislation, which has the function of advising employees only.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>The Democrats see merits in this approach. So do we&mdash;we see merits in this approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I am happy to dub this amendment that we are to move the Murray amendment No. 2. We are happy to move, at the urging of the Australian Democrats, an amendment that is based on the fundamental flaws they saw in relation to the Employment Advocate. It really is a matter of regret to us, Senator, that, in reaching your deal with the government&mdash;the apparently signed, sealed document that has been circulated&mdash;you did not recognise the fundamental flaw that you did recognise some months ago when the committee was meeting and then reporting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, we are fundamentally opposed to the creation of the Employment Advocate, but we do believe that, if we have to compromise by putting forward these fall-back amendments that you suggested, it is certainly better than what we are confronted with in respect of the Employment Advocate both in the original bill and the amendments that we have just been considering.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Sherry has already put before the Committee the ALP's position on the splitting of the Employment Advocate into bodies that do not have internal conflicts of interest. In relation to a body of this sort, there is nothing in history which is able to demonstrate and, therefore, convince us that this is workable. That a conflict of interest is fundamental.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A similar body called an enterprising bargaining unit was established by legislation in Tasmania. I had the personal experience of dealing with a case involving an enterprising bargaining unit in the relevant department which was charged with the responsibility of similarly advising employees and employers and facilitating these sorts of agreements. The conflict of interest was impossible to overcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It came to a point where a group of employees, all under the age of 20, employed in a small bakery in Burnie were confronted with an agreement which had been drafted by the enterprise bargaining unit&mdash;the equivalent of this Employment Advocate. They were advised of their rights in relation to the agreement&mdash;whether it was right or wrong or whether there were any problems with it. At the same time, that unit&mdash;the equivalent of this Employment Advocate&mdash;was advising the employer on how they would go about getting the agreement approved. It was an impossible conflict of interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The agreement ultimately was not approved in that case. In these cases we will be dealing with one-to-one circumstances. But ultimately the unit was disbanded because it was so fundamentally flawed as an authority which would purport to give advice to both sides of the picture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We go on to other questions. Even if you can get over that fundamental problem, which I suggest you cannot, the Employment Advocate, who is obviously one person, is going to have staff to do all this work. The advocate is going to delegate some of those duties to persons who are employed by a state or a territory, apparently, and they are also going to delegate functions to other persons, who, at this point, are not identified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4955"> I turn to the function of the Employment Advocate. They are going to look at these Australian workplace agreements and make a judgment as to whether the agreements satisfy the tests that are laid down in the legislation. There is nothing in this bill which says anything in relation to the standard of the person&mdash;what qualifications or training that person would undergo. On the other hand, the Industrial Relations Commission has a signifi cant team of professional people who are able to review these matters in the light of legislative tests and make decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would think that the Democrats, and certainly Senator Murray, would have to be extremely concerned that what is going to come out of this is some bureaucratic arrangement whereby class 2 or class 3 public servants are going to be making these decisions that at the moment are being made, in a variety of circumstances, by members of the Industrial Relations Commission. For example, in the state of Tasmania this would be effectively the equivalent of a deputy presidential member of the Industrial Relations Commission. But in this case there are no guarantees whatsoever, other than it is going to be vetted by the Employment Advocate, but more likely by a delegated Commonwealth public servant who is appointed or employed under the Public Service Act of 1922.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, that act might change. There has been some comment in the media about what might or might not happen with the Public Service Act. So the next thing that we might find in relation to this bill is that the intent is outflanked by a change to that act. So there are not very many guarantees at all that the Democrats have received in relation to the Employment Advocate and there are no certainties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To the extent that the Employment Advocate can delegate powers only to that class referred to in 83BE(1)(a), there is at least a little certainty, but not very much. But the other functions can be delegated to any person who is employed by a state or a territory. No qualifications are specified in the bill. No requirements are specified in the bill. The functions can be delegated to any person. It is a pretty shoddy piece of legislation in that regard. Section 83BE(2) states:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The Employment Advocate may, by written instrument, delegate a function referred to in paragraph 83BB(a), (b) or (c) to any person.</PARA>
<PARA>Effectively (a), (b) or (c) are the advisory functions&mdash;either individually to employees or employers or collectively to those two groups. There is no certainty as to who the Employment Advocate might appoint. There is no <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> direction in the legislation. If the Democrats are relying upon ministerial direction, the only power they have over that is possibly having that matter come before this Senate and disallowing it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there is no positive power that this body has in relation to those directions. It is only a negative power. So, if no direction is given and if it is an inadequate function, this parliament has effectively said, `We have no control other than by perhaps censuring the minister.' So this is an aspect of the legislation that is full of holes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I heard that under New Zealand's legislation the Hell's Angels motorbike gang were setting themselves up as bargaining agents. Perhaps it is possible that they will be seeking to become advisers.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="FORSHAW" NAMEID="656">

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8O6">Senator O'BRIEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. It would be a very interesting exercise to establish these people as advisers. In trying not to be too flippant about it, I understand that some employer organisations have stated that they would be prepared to accept the responsibility of giving this advice. Recently, I put before the Senate an example where, under the Tasmanian legislation, an employer organisation did just that in relation to the enterprise legislation that applies in the state of Tasmania under state law. It was an entirely unsatisfactory position: the employer controlled the circumstances, and the employees were receiving advice from the employer's industrial relations adviser. At the same time, when the unions sought to give advice, the employer directed employees to tear up a small written document&mdash;which made a few basic suggestions&mdash;and throw it in the bin.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So here we have a situation where the Employment Advocate can legitimise that and say, `Well, we are directing the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry to be the adviser to the employees and the employers in connection with AWAs, to advise about the relevant award and statutory entitlements and about the relevant provisions of the act.' That really is an entirely unsatisfactory set of circumstances that arises out of the bill before <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4956"> the parliament. It ought to be reconsidered in that light.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can only say that, in terms of the many other problematic aspects of this bill, when you combine this extremely shoddy schedule with the tests that are to be applied&mdash;and I accept that the Democrats have made some moves to make them somewhat more acceptable&mdash;to this absolutely unworkable and demonstrably flawed section of the bill, it is going to be a disaster in implementation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you come to the question of how many people will be needed to perform the functions that are required&mdash;remembering that there is nothing in this bill which guarantees just how many agreements will be approved&mdash;you need to consider that there is a possibility that there will be many thousands of employees who are asked whether they want to sign an agreement. If you take the most generous view in the world about how people will have real freedom of choice&mdash;which we have said in many cases will not exist&mdash;and there are thousands of people out there who want advice, where are they going to get it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly, with the budgetary allocation that has been suggested, there is no way that the Employment Advocate is going to be able to employ people and establish offices in all of the centres and all of the regions where employers operate around the country. I can tell you that, in my state and in most others, the state governments do not have the resources to provide the advice. The state governments do not have the resources to do the policing. They do not do it now in relation to their own state awards, so why are they going to accept an additional responsibility unless the Commonwealth is going to give them additional funds? The state governments are basically going to say, `If you're not going to pay us, why would we want to be appointed?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So more money is going to come out of the budget if you are going to do this properly but, if you are not going to do it properly, this provision will be a sham. In terms of the evidence, this provision will be a sham. There will be no proper advice. You will have the situation where there will be pressure. If the agreements are going before the Employment <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Advocate, how many public servants are there going to be available to vet the agreements and give them proper consideration? How much are you going to pay them? You have been talking about how much money the Labor Party needed to spend. If you are going to do this job properly, there will be many millions of dollars that need to be put into this area. Alternatively, it just will not work properly and it will be even more unfair.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam President, can I say that it certainly gives the appearance of being dishonest with regard to things that Mr Smith says. When I read some of the public statements that he has made, then I think that will become a bit clearer. I go firstly to the issue of the Tasmanian package&mdash;the big promise by the then Liberal opposition. John Howard announced this package on 7 February 1996. It says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tasmania has a unique place in the Commonwealth. The federal government has a special responsibility to achieve equality for Tasmanians in developing opportunities for their state. The coalition accepts this responsibility and in government will implement the initiatives detailed in the Tasmania package. The Tasmania package financial commitments, which amount to $67.15 million over three years, will be funded over and above the financial assistance grants made by the Commonwealth to the states.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to outline a few things with regard to the Tasmania package and what will be provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In so far as legal services are concerned, in this case as they relate to the Family Court in Launceston, due to the budget cutbacks of this government, the Family Court in Launceston has closed as such. But Mr Smith made a number of public statements, both prior to the election, during the election and after the election&mdash;since he has become a minister, in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4959"> fact. I would like to refer to some of those statements. In May 1995, Mr Smith attacked us in government and made comments in a press release that he issued on 28 May 1995. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During last week's visit, John Howard met with Mr. Steven Smith, the State Secretary of the association&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the lawyers association&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to discuss the implications for people living in Northern Tasmania and is very concerned at the downgraded and much more expensive service that Labor now wants to foist upon us.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Smith said he would be urgently contacting the Shadow Attorney General, Senator Amanda Vanstone, to ensure that the Family Law Court in Launceston would not be downgraded.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It shows yet again how out of touch the Labor Party is when it comes to the basic needs of people living in our area and how arrogant they can be when they expect people to pay an extra $500 to $600 for a service they need when in a state of emotional upheaval.</PARA>
<PARA>In another press statement of 7 August 1995 in part he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What is Silvia Smith&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the then member for Bass&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">doing besides nodding in agreement with everything that Paul Keating wants to do?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Justice Statement should be justice for all and, unfortunately, northern Tasmania is being treated with injustice by Labor.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on further in a press statement of 12 November 1995 to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Federal Member for Bass, I would ensure that a future Coalition Government sees that Tasmania receives the necessary share of social resources to help alleviate this problem.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The situation in Launceston is very serious with the current Family Law Court very overcrowded. A visiting Family Court Judge is here in November for just eight days.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Warwick Smith believes this is unacceptable.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will continue to fight for a full time resident Family Court Judge to be in Launceston. The need is clearly evident, and must be met.</PARA>
<PARA>He was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Examiner</EMPHASIS>  in August 1995 as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He said that the coalition would maintain the status quo&mdash;  <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>that is, a Family Court judge based in Launceston&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that saw one judge based in Launceston and two in Hobart before Mr Justice Butler's move.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Smith said he had discussed the issue with Shadow Attorney General Amanda Vanstone, whom he believes will visit Tasmania soon.</PARA>
<PARA>In July this year&mdash;since he became a minister&mdash;Mr Smith wrote a letter to the editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Examiner</EMPHASIS> . In part, it says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is of deep concern that an understanding between the Chief Justice and the Family Law practitioners at their meeting in mid&hyphen;June that no decision would be made until a further meeting took place is of concern. The Court administration has gazumped a full consideration of all matters put to the Chief Justice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current practice of the Court arrangements being left solely to the Court is questionable in my view. Clearly this issue and the proposed arrangement by the Court administration will need to be reviewed in the light of experience and some most fundamental questions of court administration and access continue to require attention.</PARA>
<PARA>It is signed Warwick Smith, federal member for Bass and minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, we know that we have been going through the estimates process. In questions that I put to the Family Court people in estimates they indicated that the Family Court has closed and there will not be a Family Court judge in Launceston. But the decision relating to the appointment of a Family Court judge is a matter for the government. Warwick Smith made fundamental commitments to the people of Bass and to the people of Tasmania, public commitments that he is clearly not prepared to keep. He has had the opportunity to have this question addressed by the now Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams). I am not aware that he has taken any steps to do so. Indeed, on another issue he has called Tasmanians `whingers'. It is totally unacceptable that a minister who would be aware&mdash;because he was previously a shadow minister and was even once touted as a potential leader of the Liberal Party&mdash;</PARA>

As I said, questions to estimates indicated that they were still going to seek to have the Family Court judge not replaced in Tasmania, but based in Melbourne. The supposed savings that have been touted about as the reason for not having a Family Court judge based in Launceston would seem to me to be somewhat diminished. There may be some savings because, as I understand it, the Family Court judge used to travel from Tasmania to the mainland, Victoria in particular, to do work there.

Either he should apologise for that or he should go to the Prime Minister and say, `I haven't adhered to the ministerial code of conduct, I haven't been open and honest in my public dealings.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unfortunately, I was not able to catch the comments earlier by the minister, Senator Vanstone, but I suspect that the topic that she was referring to, the issue of course costs for Australian university students versus the costs of Danish students, is an issue that I will have to take up in another adjournment debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I rise to discuss a number of education issues, including some comments made in question time yesterday by Senator Amanda Vanstone, strangely enough attacking me again over issues that I have raised in this place. It is important to get on record an issue I raised today in relation to the dependent spouse allowance. An issue of great concern <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is the fact that this chamber had, in effect, disallowed certain Austudy regulations and, in doing so, reinstated the dependent spouse allowance. That took place on 10 September this year. Unfortunately, more than seven weeks later we are yet to see any of those eligible recipients getting those dependent spouse allowance benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The DSA is paid to students who have a dependent spouse or at least one dependent child. I would like the minister to turn up in this place some time next week and explain that those students who are eligible to apply have been informed that they are eligible and that all those students who have previously been in receipt of those DSA benefits are actually now receiving them, and also to refute the claims and the evidence that we have&mdash;and it is advice that comes to the Australian Democrats from the Senate Committee on Regulations and Ordinances&mdash;that DEETYA are stating the reason that these benefits are not being paid, or that students are not being informed, is that the computer does not allow for the DSA any more. That means the computer software, presumably, has been lost or taken out of the computer and has not been reinstalled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a consequence of that, up to 15,000 people could be affected by this change and the Democrats are very concerned that these students have not been paid, despite the fact that it is the will of the Senate. I argue that this government is defying the will of the Senate by failing to provide those needy and eligible students with the payments to which they are entitled. However, in her answer to me today the minister raised the issue of drought affected students and their families and used that to attack the Australian Democrats yet again.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are quite happy to fix that up. You will note&mdash;through you, Madam President&mdash;that Senator Panizza mentions the issue of drought affected students. Not one drought affected family is affected by the change. We could put those regulations back tomorrow and they will not have missed out on any payments, as opposed <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4961"> to those students who are eligible for the DSA who are missing out on dollars every week. We are talking about struggling families here with dependent spouses or children. Unfortunately, the minister has seen fit to attack us on a number of occasions using that example&mdash;she certainly found the time to write a number of press releases on it, I believe&mdash;but she has not yet found the time to inquire what is happening with DSA recipients or those people who would be eligible to apply for the DSA.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In another issue that was raised yesterday, Minister Vanstone took issue with some figures that I used that demonstrate that students in Australian higher education institutions would, after the coalition's changes to higher education policy, be paying some of the highest tuition fees in the Western world. In fact, the evidence that we have seen demonstrates that we would be second highest in the entire world, second only to South Korea. I would like to cite the minister's comments because she has come up with some very different figures from those that I used in the chamber yesterday. The minister claims:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have estimated that on average with the benefits, taking into account the benefits of the implicit interest subsidy under the deferral option used by some&mdash;that is, the deferral of their payment&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>it sounds like something from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yes, Minister</EMPHASIS> &mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and the up&hyphen;front discount used by others, students will contribute, on average, about 27 per cent of the cost of their tuition.</PARA>
<PARA>We did not find it particularly difficult to place Australia in comparison with other countries using the World Bank table to which the minister also referred. In Australia, operating grant expenditure per equivalent full&hyphen;time student unit is $10,670. That is what it is in 1996. This figure is actually taken from the government reports, the 1997&hyphen;99 triennial report, using tables 4.3 and 4.4, for the record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Using this figure, Australian students currently pay fees&mdash;that is HECS&mdash;equivalent to 21 per cent of recurrent expenditure. This currently places Australia in eighth highest position on the World Bank chart of 33 countries, even at current levels of the contri bution of the HECS. That is not taking into account the proposed changes or the HECS hikes by this government. That means we are two places behind the United States of America.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the proposed new changes and the differential HECS scheme, students will be paying $4,500 on average, or perhaps even a little less, because of relative numbers in each HECS band. This would actually place Australia at the top of the table with over 42 per cent. I look forward to the minister coming back to explain how she managed to come up with a figure of around 27 per cent when the calculations that have been done by my office, by me, by the National Tertiary Education Union and, I imagine, by a number of other bodies using the same system outlined by the World Bank and the World Bank charts, show that we have reached a figure of 42 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regardless of the&mdash;I think the words that Senator Vanstone showed me just then were `fanciful' or `difficult'&mdash;statistics that we were using, under the proposed changes Australian students will be paying fees that are prohibitively high. They are exorbitant fees. As we heard on Monday during a public hearing of the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, they will shift the composition towards the wealthier students in this country. We will ensure that those people who have the money to pay will be those who are entitled to access higher education in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not surprised that the minister is playing with figures or that she has misled the parliament on this issue as well as on a number of issues. I am willing to stand corrected on this one, but it adds to a long list. In the last couple of weeks we have seen so many slips by the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. The Democrats could not help but take offence at some of the accusations made at us and pointed to us regarding our home page on the Internet. To accuse us of breaching privacy provisions was absolutely outrageous. To accuse us of compiling lists for mailing and other services was just outrageous.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4962">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am only glad that the minister had to come in here and apologise, not for that accusation&mdash;she is yet to take that one back&mdash;but to admit her error that she had not received faxes from students and from members of the community who were protesting against higher education contribution changes, or Austudy changes for that matter, through our Internet and e-mail service. The minister had received faxes and we had transmission records as evidence. I am glad that the minister chose to apologise on that issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We only need to mention the words `Wright family' to bring a shiver to the spine of the minister. That is another example of an error that was made by the minister and by her department. Again, thankfully, she has apologised for that mistake. But it has done nothing except perpetuate the stereotype that Austudy and student financial assistance in this country is easy to access and it is particularly generous when we know that eligibility criteria for such an scheme are incredibly tight, very stringent and imposed very strongly by the department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this parliament over the last fortnight the most recent argument we have had involving the minister has related to her comments about employment projections and the achievability of the five per cent unemployment target by the turn of the century. The minister has been forced to acknowledge, and hopefully will concede further, that she made a mistake on that issue as well.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I was going to devote my speech on the adjournment debate to some very ill-considered comments of the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, who referred to parliamentarians on both sides of this parliament&mdash;both in the lower house and here in the Senate&mdash;as `bastards, bitches and ignoramuses' and somehow thought that by using that description he would increase the tone and level of the euthanasia debate within this country and inject some maturity into the debate. I simply say to Mr Stone: if you want to increase and raise the level of the euthana <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> sia debate within this country, you ought desist from using those sorts of words; you do not increase your own stature by trying to cut off at the knees those who seem to oppose you.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I simply make the plea to the Chief Minister that he restrain from that sort of extravagant language, come back down to earth and realise that people on all sides of this parliament are giving the euthanasia debate serious and genuine consideration and that that sort of terminology employed by him does no benefit for the debate and, above all, does him no credit whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The matter that I want to debate this evening is the exciting announcement by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) and the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) this evening of the new woodchip licences. That is a great boost and boon to our economy, particularly that of Tasmania. It will provide security for jobs and potential for extra jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that the previous Labor contributor in this debate just continued with his normal attacks. Yesterday it was on Senator Newman about her office. Tonight it was on the member for Bass, Warwick Smith. He gets into these personal attacks rather than getting on with the real job. That is what the government has been doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that the Labor senator who devoted 10 minutes of his time to a personal attack on the member for Bass also rejoices in the title of being president of the CFMEU in Tasmania, which allegedly represents the forest workers. We know that that honourable senator voted against the very export woodchip regulations which have now allowed Tasmania to benefit in such a very real way and provide extra jobs for Tasmanians. The announcement will provide certainty for timber workers and investors alike. There is the prospect of even further jobs in the timber sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The allocation of licences is the culmination of the Liberal government's commitment to Tasmania's timber workers and communities. The small sawmillers in Tasmania will be big winners, as will be the private tree growers. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4963"> This is a victory for all sectors in the timber industry, especially for workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After a decade of bungling this issue by the Labor Party and the Labor government, the Liberal Party has now successfully delivered certainty within the first 12 months of government, in fact, within the first eight months of government. So the people out there can contrast 10 years of bungling and uncertainty with the delivery of certainty, job security and, indeed, more job opportunities within only eight months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This shift and definite action shows the high priority that the government has given to providing security for timber workers. That is in stark contrast to Labor which is still wallowing in the aftermath of its shameful failed attempt to defeat the regulations which allowed for these new job and investment opportunities. Timber workers can now be absolutely satisfied right around Australia in regional seats, and especially in my home state of Tasmania, that it is the Liberal Party that genuinely delivers job security and opportunities for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been actively involved, ever since being appointed to the Senate, in pursuing the interests of the timber workers and the timber industry and in providing security and certainty for them. Within the two and a half years that I have been here, this really is the culmination of very important decisions that have been taken and it has allowed people to realise that we, in the Liberal Party, are genuinely concerned about the timber industry, about workers and about providing job opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our first task was to win government. The second task was to bring in appropriate regulations. The third and final task has been delivered this evening in the provision of those licences. I can understand that senators opposite feel somewhat concerned whenever the issue of woodchips is mentioned. The federal campaign consultative panel of the Australian Labor Party in New South Wales said that there were certain real problems in their strategy. They said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was, however, a number of issues involving ministers during the final term of the government which had damaged the image of the party. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>Do you know what they were? They were: Carmen Lawrence, the whiteboard affair and woodchipping. What do they do? They appoint Carmen Lawrence as Shadow Minister for the Environment. She has opposed the creation of every single one of the new jobs that are going to be provided as a result of these decisions. We do not even have to rely on the New South Wales division of the Labor Party because a state colleague of mine, Senator Sue Mackay, Labor senator for Tasmania, assisted the Labor Party federally in analysing the problems that Labor had at the last election. She wrote, along with Barry Jones, the national president and the national secretary Gary Gray, these words under the heading, `Priorities and balance and what went wrong'. The first item was woodchips, jobs and environment. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The logging dispute and the blockade of parliament house exposed seemingly intractable conflicts between two of Labor's important constituencies&mdash;workers and environmentalists.</PARA>
<PARA>They tried to sit on the barbwire fence and it did untold damage to both sectors during the last election. But they were pushed off the fence when they voted on the export woodchip regulations. When they voted on those, they jumped off on the side of the environmentalists, thus deserting the workers. Undoubtedly, that is why people such as the honourable senators opposite, such as Senator Murphy, come into this House day after day trying to engage in personal attacks on Senator Newman, the member for Bass, rather than dealing with the real issues&mdash;because they know. Senator Murphy, himself, is allegedly the president of the forest workers union in Tasmania. He voted against the regulations which provided them with certainty. He voted against the regulations which would provide new job opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a party, within the first eight months of government, we have delivered certainty and security to this industry, something that Labor could not do for over a decade. Why? Because they were trying to play off both sides. We unashamedly say that we want environmental responsibility but we also want to provide security.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4964">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people of Australia need to realise that a lot of these extra export woodchip opportunities basically are from sawmill residues which would otherwise have been burnt or from waste which lies on the forest floor and, under Labor's environmental policy, it lies there either to rot or burn. We say, `Let us export it. Let us provide jobs. Let us provide environmental responsibility and let us provide jobs for the unemployed around this country.' Today's announcement has been very welcome, especially by the people of Tasmania.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<STATE> (Australian Capital Territory)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(7.50 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this evening to talk on an issue very close to my heart, that of child care. Child care was certainly a major issue for me in considering entering this place and in putting my name forward in the election. Quality care for my children was an absolute priority and, in fact, a prerequisite to my making that decision. I knew that many of my nights would be spent in this place like this evening or at other commitments that come along with job and I needed to be very confident that the care my children were receiving was not only adequate but also the very best that I could afford.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that the bulk of my salary is paid for that care makes me no different from most other parents in the work force. This is not often experienced even by senators and I think that most senators are rarely in a position these days to use formal care on a day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day basis. If they had to, I suspect that the government would not be so keen on making their changes to child&hyphen;care arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To more easily understand the commitment that many families are making towards child care, consider this: the cost of sending a primary school child to, for example, Canberra Boys Grammar is comparable to the cost of sending a one&hyphen;year&hyphen;old to full-time care. For most of us, a private school education is out of reach and this interesting fact was brought to my attention by a constituent. I thought it would be most helpful to those opposite to understand the commitment parents make to ensuring that their children receive the best quality care available.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to offer those in this place who have never personally confronted the issue of finding full-time care a little history lesson, if I may. Child&hyphen;care centres developed from a need. The majority were centres established and organised by parents or community groups like the local parish church or the YWCA. They often used any large building they could access cheaply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of Canberra's first centres, Black Mountain, was set up in a scout hall 17 years ago by parents who could not find care for their children. The scout hall, with its wooden floors and high windows, was the only place available. There was not any heating, other than an open fireplace, and that could not be used because it was too dangerous for the young children. Children from toddlers to preschoolers shared the same space and there were a few swings outside.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The hall had to be cleared of furniture each evening and every time it rained heavily the stormwater drain outside would overflow and flow into the hall, and the workers would have to form a bailing line to bail out the water. It was pretty tough going. The conditions, by today's standards, were atrocious, but one parent using the care at the time has described the workers as always being terrific and never complaining. Often parents themselves would come down to relieve sick workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The toll on both parents and workers was great, but the return was even greater. Within months of opening, the centre was full and had a massive waiting list. Regardless of the accommodation, the love of the carers and the quality of the program offered brought parents to the centre's door. But I am sure that Black Mountain was not unique. There was a need and parents in the community responded. That need is no less today. But in 1996, this government has set out to destroy these community centres by abolishing the subsidy they had been receiving to assist with administration of the centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are non-profit centres. They fundraise tirelessly to buy new toys, subsidise excursions and upgrade their facilities, and they are often the only places that will take in very young babies and special needs children. The <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4965"> operational subsidy is recognition of the professionalism of the parents who manage the centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the dogged philosophical pursuit of competition, this government is demanding that these centres compete with private centres, centres run to make a profit. I simply do not understand this approach. Community centres are non-profit organisations. They do not make money. Indeed, one should probably consider them as a charity. Yet this government wants to cut all the assistance it provides.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To add salt to this wound, the government has made a pretty back&hyphen;handed offer for financial counselling from consultants to the value of about $8 million. This government has little understanding, obviously, of the insult this proposal is. Not only does it say that they don't think community centres run by parents and community groups should exist, but this government does not think they can manage their own financial affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These centres have been managing their own affairs for the past 20 years&mdash;centres on a shoestring, maintaining high standards and flexibility for families in difficult times. This government's actions are an insult to them. Abolishing subsidies in centres will either close them or they will have to charge parents an extra $30 a week. For the senators opposite $30 a week probably is not so much, but for most parents out there $30 a week may well be the difference between working and not. It may well be the difference between formal, qualified care and over&hyphen;the&hyphen;fence, backyard care. Parents may be forced to remove their children from supervised care and place their trust in someone who may be caring for numerous children, in unsafe homes, with no knowledge or regulation or guidance as to what occurs once the door closes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is what child care in Australia has been dragged from. This is where the past 20 years of lobbying and hard work has taken child care. To consider a return to such conditions raises great concerns amongst the long&hyphen;time workers in the industry. This government has no regard for the consequences of their actions.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was honoured to speak at a family picnic day last weekend that concluded Children's Week in the ACT. Ignoring the storm clouds, hundreds of people gathered at Commonwealth Park to celebrate quality child care and the people who deliver it. Speakers included child&hyphen;care workers, parents, students and directors of centres. Family day care, community centres and private centres were represented. The various sectors of the industry in the ACT have shown an unusual solidarity in opposing these all&hyphen;encompassing threats to child care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of the speakers spoke of the consequences of the other changes this government intends for child care. The 50&hyphen;hour a week cap on child&hyphen;care assistance does not recognise the needs of shift workers, workers who work overtime or students. Centres, whether private or community, will either charge more or restrict hours. Parents who already use extended hours will either lose their jobs or have to find more money. The tampering with the eligibility for child&hyphen;care assistance will mean fewer families will get assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish senators opposite could meet the people who work in child care. The fact that we get so much for so little&mdash;we pay workers who care for children less than we pay a person to tend plants&mdash;is pure dedication. They are so dedicated and care so much about the standard of care they provide. The thought of taking child care back 20 years concerns them and most have been around child care over those years and have worked hard at giving Australian children one of the very best child&hyphen;care systems in the world. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator Hill</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The recent adoption and opening for signature of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), in which Australia played a major role, is an historic step forward in global efforts to advance nuclear non&hyphen;proliferation and disarmament goals. Australia was very concerned that time was running out for the international community to have a CTBT open for signature by September 1996, as had been called for unanimously by the UN General Assembly last year. That is why, when all avenues were exhausted in the Conference on Disarmament, Australia acted promptly and initiated action which allowed the draft CTBT to be adopted and opened for signature by the international community at the UN General Assembly. Before making the final decision to go ahead, we consulted several key countries, including the nuclear weapon states, but the decision to take the CTBT to the United Nations for adoption was purely an Australian initiative. Australia's action was the natural conclusion to more than twenty years work to achieve a permanent end to nuclear testing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)(a)  The CTBT adopted by the United Nations General Assembly and opened for signature on 24 September 1996 will enter into force 180 days after the date of deposit of the instruments of ratification by all 44 states listed in the treaty, including the five nuclear weapon states and India, Pakistan and Israel, but in no case earlier than two years after the treaty's opening for signature.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Australia is urging all states that have not yet done so to sign and then ratify the CTBT as soon as possible, so that it can be fully implemented. If the CTBT has not entered into force within three years of its opening for signature, there will be a Conference of States Parties to consider and decide by consensus what measures consistent with international law may be undertaken to accelerate the ratification process in order to facilitate the early entry into force of the treaty. This process will be repeated at subsequent anniversaries of the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> opening for signature of the treaty, until its entry into force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even if the CTBT does not enter into force for some time, signature of the treaty will constitute a political and moral commitment to renounce nuclear testing. There is also a principle of international law that a state which has signed a treaty is obliged to refrain from acts which would defeat the object and purpose of the treaty even before its entry into force. Each of the five nuclear weapon states&mdash;the United States, the United Kingdom, Russia, France and China&mdash;signed the CTBT upon its opening for signature at the United Nations in New York on 24 September. The fact that over 100 countries have signed the treaty since 24 September demonstrates the strength of international feeling against nuclear testing. By bringing nuclear testing to an end, the CTBT is a vital step in the nuclear disarmament process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) No. In its recent advisory opinion, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) unanimously agreed that there exists an obligation to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control. The Canberra Commission on the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons carefully considered the merits of setting out a precise timeframe for the elimination of nuclear weapons, but elected not to do so. The Commission recommended that nuclear weapon elimination should be conducted as a series of phased, verified reductions, and emphasised that "the process followed must ensure that no state feels, at any stage, that further nuclear disarmament is a threat to security." The Government does not see any advantage in being prescriptive as to the detail, timing or sequence of nuclear disarmament. That is also the approach taken by the Commission. See also the answer to question 5.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) As noted in the answer to question (1), the CTBT has been adopted by the UN General Assembly and opened for signature. For the first time, the international community can reasonably hope and expect that nuclear testing will not be part of the future to be faced by succeeding generations. The Australian Government recognises that the CTBT is not a perfect treaty. However, as the overwhelming vote in favour of the CTBT resolution at the United Nations demonstrates, the vast majority of countries believe that the CTBT adopted by the UN General Assembly and opened for signature is as fair a reflection of the middle ground as it was possible to achieve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is committed to the twin goals of preventing proliferation of nuclear weapons and working through progressive balanced steps towards complete nuclear disarmament. However, neither this nor preceding governments in Australia have supported the concept of a so&hyphen;called timebound <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4969"> framework for nuclear disarmament. The Government's priority in this area is to focus on practical, realistic steps to achieve the ultimate elimination of nuclear weapons. It considers that calls for a restrictive timebound approach to the disarmament process are not realistic, and therefore do not advance the cause of disarmament in any concrete or practical way. What is required to advance the cause of nuclear disarmament is a patient and dogged pursuit of the various interlocking steps on the path to the complete elimination of nuclear weapons. In the Government's view, it simply does not make sense to advocate the sort of tight, sterile linkage that holds one negotiation or process hostage to the conclusion of another. The most likely outcome of such an approach would be impasse. The Government believes that it is more productive for the international community to concentrate on actually achieving further progress towards nuclear disarmament rather than seeking to debate an artificial timetable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) There were no proposals to alter the text of the CTBT at the resumed UNGA 50 session.  The UN resolution adopting the CTBT and opening it for signature was adopted by an overwhelming majority of states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) As noted in the answer to question (5), the Government is committed to the twin goals of preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons and working through progressive balanced steps towards complete nuclear disarmament. Among the most immediate tasks will be to work for the early commencement of substantive negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament on a convention prohibiting the production of fissile material for use in nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices (known as a "cut&hyphen;off" convention).  This is widely acknowledged as the next logical multilateral step after a CTBT and would be a major new addition to the process of nuclear disarmament and to strengthening barriers to nuclear proliferation. Australia is also interested in working for agreement in the Conference on Disarmament on an appropriate framework for the discussion of nuclear disarmament questions, as part of a future comprehensive agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The nuclear weapon states will continue to bear the major responsibility for steps to reduce further their nuclear stockpiles, with a view to their ultimate elimination. Australia will continue to encourage the nuclear weapon states to maintain the good progress achieved over the past several years in bringing about significant reductions to their nuclear stockpiles/arsenals. The recently released report of the Canberra Commission on the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons, which the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer, presented to the UN General Assembly on 30 September 1996 and which the Government will present to the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Conference on Disarmament in January 1997, makes a significant contribution to new international thinking on nuclear disarmament.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Negotiations on the political future of New Caledonia are under way between the French Government and the principal political forces in the territory. These negotiations are being held in the context of the Matignon Accords, a set of agreements reached in 1988 which followed a period of serious unrest, during which some fifty people were killed. In April of this year the French Government indicated that it did not see a transition to independence at this time as consistent with efforts to attain a broadly&hyphen;supported consensus resolution of uncertainties about the territory's constitutional future. At that time the French Government expressed a preference for increased autonomy in the territory, without however ruling out further constitutional evolution in due course.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Through the Major Projects Feasibility Study fund, the Commonwealth Government contributed $65,000 to a pre-feasibility study of a medium density fibreboard (MDF) plant in Tasmania. The study was completed in September 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Based on the positive outcome from the study, an investment brief was prepared which the Commonwealth Investment Promotion and Facilitation Program (IP&amp;F) circulated through its investment counsellor network in Asia, North America and Europe.
