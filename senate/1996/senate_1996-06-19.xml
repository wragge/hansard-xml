<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The statement read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Purpose of Bill</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are currently limitations on the transfer of the Development Allowance benefit where ownership of a project is transferred to another entity after application for the allowance but before registration; and across different entity structures after registration but before pre&hyphen;qualification for the Allowance. The amendments will allow all types of project restructures of a bona fide nature and for genuine commercial reasons, and are conducive to completing the carrying out of the project. To be effective, they will be retrospective and will apply from 1 January 1993, which is the date applications <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1755"> for the Allowance closed. The Bill also contains minor technical amendments to Infrastructure Borrowings provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reasons for seeking introduction and passage of the Bill in the 1996 Winter sittings</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Priority status was obtained for these measures for the 1995 Spring Sittings. However, while the 1995 Bill passed all stages in the House of Representatives, it was not passed by the Senate due to the pressure of business. The main reason for the request to maintain priority status is that existing statutory deadlines for registration and pre&hyphen;qualification for the Allowance mean that passage in the 1996 Winter Sittings is considered essential.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> A project must be registered for the Allowance before it can apply for a pre&hyphen;qualification certificate which is a pre&hyphen;requisite for eligibility for the 10% tax deduction when the relevant plant is either used for the purpose of producing assessable income or installed ready for use for that purpose.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> An application for a pre&hyphen;qualification certificate is to be given to the Development Allowance Authority (DAA) before 1 August 1996.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Therefore, it is essential and time critical that the amendments on project restructures are both introduced and passed in the Winter sittings. Otherwise they may not be passed until the Spring Sittings in 1996, in which event it will be impossible for the DAA to register projects. As a result, the applicants cannot prepare and lodge valid applications for pre&hyphen;qualification.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Legal advice from Attorney&hyphen;General's have indicated that the DAA has no power to accept an application for pre&hyphen;qualification prior to registration. There is also no discretion to the DAA to accept an application for pre&hyphen;qualification after 31 July 1996 deadline. Eligible applicants under the amended provisions may miss out on the Allowance.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the Government's Law and Justice Policy foreshadowed a "statute stocktake" to repair existing Commonwealth legislation, with a view to having the repair process in sight of completion by 2001.  <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1757"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The processes for the statute stocktake, and a program for the next 5 years, are still to be worked out.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, this Statute Law Revision Bill begins the work of repairing the Commonwealth statute book.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill deals with four aspects of repairing the statute book.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, it repeals a number of acts whose operation is exhausted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, it corrects minor clerical and drafting errors in various current acts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The kinds of errors being corrected are spelling mistakes, mistakes in punctuation, mistakes in the numbering or lettering of parts of acts (for example, incorrect numbering of subsections or incorrect lettering of paragraphs) and misdescribed amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A misdescribed amendment is one that either incorrectly describes the text to be amended or specifies the wrong location for the insertion of new text.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although the intended effect of the amendments is usually clear, it can be confusing or misleading to leave these errors uncorrected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In particular, misdescribed amendments can delay the publication of official reprints, and can affect the accuracy of commercial consolidations of acts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For instance, an amendment that purports to require a new provision to be inserted after a non-existent provision would probably be given some meaning by a court if the general intention of the amendment was clear.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, it would be inappropriate to publish an official reprint when the act cannot be consolidated because the proper location of the new provision is not clear.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Correcting errors of these kinds does not change the law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, it ensures that consolidated acts can be published, and without confusing mistakes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In some cases, this may have a significant impact on the accessibility of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I confirm to the Senate that the Ministerial Council for Corporations has been consulted and, to the extent necessary, has approved the amendments to the Corporations Law which are included in this bill in accordance with the Heads of Agreement between the Commonwealth, the States and the Northern Territory on Future Corporate Regulation in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thirdly, the bill brings up to date a large number of references in acts to the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1988 the name of the act was changed from Remuneration Tribunals (plural) Act to Remuneration Tribunal (singular) Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although the old form of the title in legislation does not create any legal problems, it is desirable that all references to the act reflect the current form of its title.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, the bill continues the process, which has been going on for some years, of altering gender specific language in acts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main element in this process is the insertion of feminine pronouns to accompany masculine pronouns wherever they occur.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill, while not changing the law, makes many useful improvements to the statute book.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of this bill be adjourned until the first day of sitting in the Spring sittings, in accordance with the order agreed to on 29 November 1994.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<PARA>There is, I believe, a recognition of the urgency and importance of this chamber making a statement in relation to the situation in Burma. There is one important but small reason for that and one larger and significant reason. One reason is that today is the birthday of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. It is a time when all eyes around the world are looking towards the situation in Burma and feeling the pain of that situation on the birthday of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. That is the smaller reason for it being urgent today. The larger reason is that the situation in that country is increasingly concerning and we need to make a public statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I circulated a motion for formality. I believe the reason we have not been able to arrive at a formal motion is not any unwillingness to cooperate on the part of any of the parties in this chamber but because of the complexity and sensitivity of the issues in Burma. From discussions with both Senator Hill, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, and Senator Schacht, acting on behalf of the Labor Party in relation to this motion, it seems that I have some competing amendments.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe it is urgent that we get this debate under way so that we can reach a consensus in this chamber to achieve the greatest possible good in making a public statement that will illustrate the concern we have about the situation in Burma and to say that Australia is taking seriously these concerns and is making a stand on those matters. I urge my colleagues to support the motion for suspension of standing orders to allow us to debate a motion that will constructively assist in giving a voice to the people who are concerned about democracy in Burma now.</PARA></SPEECH>

These programs are listened to in Burma by people interested in human rights to know that the world is thinking of them. If this motion were carried today, that would be broadcast.

<PARA>I reiterate that what we are discussing today is not only an expression of greeting to Daw Aung San Suu Kyi for her birthday today, 19 June, but also the deep concern that people throughout the world have felt about the recent moves by the military regime in Burma against the democracy movement in that country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only recently, we have heard with grave concern about the increasing number of arrests of those people who were democratically elected in Burma in the elections of 1990 to prevent them meeting together. The movement of people throughout that country has been curtailed by the military regime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard very disturbing evidence of scorched earth tactics being used in the form of looting and burning in  villages in Kayah State. Heaven knows that the information is not as clear and comprehensive as we would wish in relation to other areas and the problems that are being experienced by minority groups in Burma.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We express our approval of the strong stance that this government and the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) have taken in response to the renewed oppression in Burma. We want to make sure that that stance is supported at every level by this parliament. That is why this motion does two things. It  expresses our concern and it urges this government to take its responsibility very seriously and to go even further than the previous government was prepared to go. In the United States moves have been made by the state legislature of Massachusetts to ban state contracts with companies doing business in Burma. As far as I know, that has not yet received total assent but there is pressure in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that it is time that Australia considered a stronger stance than the one we have taken so far because the situation in Burma is deteriorating rapidly. We can no <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1760"> longer say that constructive engagement is achieving anything. We are standing by and letting a disastrous situation get worse and we are remaining silent. We become culpable when we do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The motion I have moved calls on the government to actively discourage Australian companies from doing business in Burma. We read news reports daily of increasing attempts to exploit the situation in Burma, to exploit the willingness of the SLORC to entice trade as a way of building up their support. This is not acceptable. As global citizens we have to voice our protest against it. That is the reason for the motion that is being put to the chamber today. I have heard from the government and from Senator Schacht their concerns about the wording of this motion, so I welcome to the debate the suggestions that are supplied and indicate that we will be prepared to support anything that strengthens the stand of Australia and makes our voice much stronger on these issues.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA>It is the birthday of Burma's pro-Democracy leader. It is a good occasion, therefore, to recognise her courage and her determination to bring political freedom to her people. Anyone who has been prepared to accept the loss of his or her own freedom for as long as she did in an effort to focus the international community's attention on the plight of the Burmese people and to focus the attention of the SLORC on the determination of the Burmese people to obtain their political freedom deserves the admiration of all of us. Certainly she is an example to the whole international community of one who is prepared to suffer severe personal sacrifice to achieve a political end for her people which is just and fair. We admire her for that. We recognise her internationally for the democratic leadership that she offers the Burmese people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also an occasion to internationally condemn the policies of the SLORC. Those of us who have sat down with the SLORC generals from time to time and tried to influence them to a different way, both positively and negatively, by pointing out the consequences that Burma as a country suffers by not being accepted willingly within the international community, the consequences it has suffered as a result of lack of access to international financial institutions and the like, and the comparisons with other developing nations that are prepared to embrace democracy and become part of a civilised international community that respects human rights and freedoms, those of us who have tried, in a positive sense, to persuade the generals that a reform of their undemocratic regime would earn the respect of their own people and the respect of the international community, understand just how complex the issue is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The generals will argue, as all generals in these circumstances do, that their first responsibility is to maintain internal stability, that that is an essential for the wellbeing of their people.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You have heard this argument before? In this instance, through the history of Burma, it has always been the army <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1761"> that has been called upon to save the people from internal trauma and suffering that would result from the instability of political uncertainty. It is very difficult to convince generals who have been brought up within an isolated world such as we find in Burma that there is no reason for them actually to be frightened of change, that it can actually bring them great credit if they are prepared to embrace it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I only say that to try, in a simplistic way, to demonstrate that this is a difficult debate not only for us but internally within Burma. I have sat down in Burma and talked to dissidents who have just been released after months, in some instances years, in prison, and in appalling circumstances in prison. We have heard of the psychological pressure that is placed on them in isolation cells for months on end. Yet some of these dissidents say to me that the isolation of Burma, which is the trend of Senator Chamarette's motion, is the worst thing for Burma's future, that the best chance of change for Burma is if it is opened up to the world&mdash;opened up to pressure from the international community and also opened up in such a way that the Burmese people have an opportunity to appreciate the benefits that come from a different form of government, a democratic form of government, where political freedoms are treated as important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some, including Aung San Suu Kyi herself, argue to the contrary. They believe that by opening doors to the international community and the international community responding in terms of trade, aid and political contact, it actually takes pressure off the generals to reform. So the debate within Burma is a complex one. The debate for those of us in the international community who are trying to work out the best way to influence change in Burma is an equally complex one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No&hyphen;one has found the right formula. The ASEAN countries believe that a constructive engagement is more likely to bring about political change.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has held the view that that is probably not so. With the exception of the United States, Australia has probably had the strongest anti&hyphen;trade and investment policies of any country in the world. But that has not achieved the objective that we are <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> seeking, either. In fact, this motion is being debated in an environment in which the SLORC has just introduced new draconian laws to outlaw political meetings and political contact. So the correct set of policies for the international community is difficult to find.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is clear is that the only chance of the international community influencing positive change is if the countries of the democratic world work together, work through the issues and try to find a common position. There is no chance that a country such as ours, operating in isolation, will have any effect whatsoever on the policies of the SLORC or make any advance in seeking to achieve the political advantage for the Burmese people that is our objective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think, by and large, that the policies that were put down by the previous Labor government in this country were right&mdash;the benchmark set of policies whereby if positive changes do occur, they are acknowledged and supported and if they do not, we continue to apply all the diplomatic pressure that is open to us. We do not encourage Australian trade or investment in the country until we see an improved political outlook. But we do, both with the carrot and the stick, try to encourage some positive change. We can see no better set of policies than that at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our concern with the Greens' motion is that there is no evidence that it is actually more likely to achieve the outcome that we are all seeking. In fact, what concerns me is that it is so easy for us in addressing an issue as complex as Burma to pass resolutions that might make us feel good, to feel that we have done our bit by passing a resolution calling on the Australian government to actively discourage Australian companies from doing business in Burma, to use the words of the Greens (WA). But if that does not achieve any positive outcome for the Burmese people, then what is the real benefit of moving in that direction?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those reasons I have put down in the form of an amendment an alternative set of words. I think it encompasses everything that the Senate would want to say. It congratulates Daw Aung San Suu Kyi on her courage and determination. It condemns the SLORC for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1762"> refusing to accept the verdict of the Burmese people at their election. It particularly mentions and condemns the latest heavy handed attempts by the SLORC to curtail political opposition. It urges the Australian government to maintain the embargo on the export of defence and defence related goods, and the Australian government will do so. But that is an instance where the whole international community is in agreement on a sanction&mdash;breached in some instances, I regret to say. Nevertheless, it is mouthed by the whole international community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My amendment also urges the Australian government to work with other governments internationally to explore ways in which we can press the SLORC to release currently held political prisoners, to desist from practices of forced labour, which is the only way in which you can characterise some of the labour practices that they pursue, and to press the SLORC to respect basic human rights and freedoms and democratic expression. I believe the amendment is a better set of words to reflect the views of senators in this place and to encourage the Australian government to continue down the policy path that they are presently maintaining.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real reason these motions have been moved&mdash;although it is taking up some time of the Senate this morning&mdash;is because there is no doubt that in the world at the moment Burma is probably almost at the top of the list of countries that democratic countries look at as a consistent abuser of human rights. Yesterday in another context Senator Hill mentioned that I had some interest in the issue of Burma in the past. I have always had an interest in Burma. I had a chance to visit in 1989 and 1992 on a private basis. I am now very proud of the fact that in 1989 I was able to meet Aung San Suu Kyi just before she was put away for six years under house arrest in Rangoon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today is Aung San Suu Kyi's birthday. For me it is very appropriate that I can associate myself personally with these remarks on her birthday. As former Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, which looked into human rights, I have had an opportunity to meet many people around the world who have made major issues of human rights. Aung San Suu Kyi is without doubt one of the most outstanding figures on the world stage, promoting not just human rights in her own country but the general principles of human rights everywhere. The meeting I had with her was one of the most intellectually challenging I have ever had in relation to the issues she raised and the way she put them. There is no doubt, as is her right in my view, that if she were to be the democratically elected Prime Minister of Burma, she would be an outstanding leader in world terms. I hope some time in the not too distant future that we may be able to welcome her to this country as the democratically elected Prime Minister of a democratically run Burma.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1763"> We should point out that in 1990 the party she leads&mdash;the National League for Democra cy&mdash;in an election that SLORC allowed, which just shows us how out of touch they were, won over 80 per cent of the seats in the parliament. From time to time Labor and Liberal members in this country have prided ourselves on having a landslide win here and there. None of us has ever been able to match the landslide victory that the NLD achieved in the only free election that has been allowed in Burma since the 1950s. Of course, the SLORC immediately ignored the result. They were so shocked by it. They could not understand why the Burmese people would so overwhelmingly vote for Aung San Suu Kyi. The reason they do is that they recognise that she is the one person in their country at the moment with the commitment to democracy to be able to run the country in a democratic way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should also be put on the record on her birthday that she is the daughter of the founder of modern Burma, General Aung San, who achieved independence for Burma in the late 1940s from the British. Although she is her father's daughter, everybody in Burma recognises that in her own right she has made her way and established her credentials as the major leader, not just because she is her father's daughter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of us have been inspired by the fact that through six years of house arrest, completely cut off from the rest of the world, even her own family for most of that time, she never caved in to the SLORC and she never accepted any financial assistance to provide food. She paid for provisions herself, even though that was very difficult at times. She never gave in when the rest of us in the world would have given up in the end because of that pressure that was being applied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now we see those remarkable scenes each week of up to 10,000 Burmese citizens gathering outside her residence to show their support for her. There is no doubt that if you had a general free assembly in Burma millions would turn up, as they did in August 1988 when she made her first address to the public of Burma on the steps of the Shwe Dagon Pagoda. It was estimated by our ambassador at the time, who attended and observed that rally, that as many as three <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> million people may have attended a rally at which she spoke. Even if that figure was exaggerated by 100 per cent, it is still over one million people. That is a size that we in Australia have never contemplated, but again shows the support for her.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing that should not be underestimated about Aung San Suu Kyi is her ability to unify the country through her policies. Senator Hill has quite rightly pointed out that when you have talks with the SLORC, as he and I have both had, they say the main justification for the military regime is that they are the only organisation capable of keeping the unity of Burma. That is utterly false. Through most of the last 35 years of Burmese history, there have been insurrections and insurgencies by various minority ethnic groups who have resented the heavy&hyphen;handed military regime first of Ne Win and now of SLORC&mdash;unfortunately, its natural successor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Aung San Suu Kyi has proposed a democratic structure that would enable the minorities of Burma to have a fair say in the running of their own affairs, to preserve their own culture and to preserve their own language and education within a united Burma&mdash;something the SLORC is not capable of understanding. The only way they treat these issues is to send the army in on military campaigns against the minority groups within Burma. It is clear that the National League for Democracy is the one political party capable of bringing together, at a national level, the various views of the minority groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen in recent days why this resolution is so important. The loosening up of the regime&mdash;and we all welcomed the fact that they released Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest&mdash;was a step forward which we all welcomed. This was the point Senator Hill made. Unfortunately in Burma it is like one step forward and two steps back, and wherever you are in the steps you do not quite know what resolution you should carry. One moment you might be a bit more optimistic so you give the SLORC a little encouragement in a resolution or a public statement on behalf of the Australian government. The next <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1764"> week they snatch it back, so then you have to have a tougher position.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. The SLORC is really an enigma to itself, let alone to the rest of us. SLORC is an insular group of army officers. Most of them have never served overseas. Most of them have only ever had a career fighting the insurgents around the borders of Burma. When I was there and had a meeting with a group of its colonels in 1992&mdash;this was three years after the fall of the Berlin wall&mdash;they were still proudly pronouncing that Burma was neutral and non-aligned between the superpowers. So when I said, `Just a moment. Russia has had a free and democratic election; communism has been abandoned. The Berlin Wall has come down. Who are you neutral between?', the irony of my question went right over the top of their heads. They still argued that Burma's neutrality was of major importance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the problem with the SLORC. I met a former leader of the SLORC, General Saw Maung, who rose from the rank of corporal to be the head of the army and then the head of the SLORC. That was an hour after I had met Aung San Suu Kyi in 1989. The abilities of each of them were like chalk and cheese. Aung San Suu Kyi was a leader of great vision, courage and intellectual standing and the other was an extraordinarily narrow-minded general who had only spent his time serving in the Burmese army fighting insurgence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To my astonishment, one of the justifications the general made for the military coup in September 1988 that established the SLORC was that at that time the American 7th Fleet was sailing across the Bay of Bengal and if they did not take action to restore army control of Burma the Americans would have invaded Burma. I started to laugh at such an absurd notion when I realised that he was not just putting it to me as a propaganda point; he firmly believed that American intervention into Burmese affairs via the 7th Fleet was a real possibility. That gives you some idea of the mind-set of this military regime and why <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> dealing with someone like Aung San Suu Kyi is such a threat to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Rangoon there is a lake in the middle of the city. At one end of the lake is Aung San Suu Kyi's residence. For six years the army surrounded it to stop people getting in to say hello to her and offer their support. The army was there to keep the people from showing their support. At the other end of the lake is the residence which the former military dictator Ne Win lives in. It is also surrounded by the military, but, as local people will tell you, that is to keep the people from trying to get in and get rid of Ne Win. The army offers him protection from the people who resent his maladministration for nearly 30 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As some other people have commented, one way or the other these two figures have become the nub of the political outcome&mdash;that is, which one will, in the end, come to the fore and become leader. It is clear to me that, overwhelmingly, the Burmese people want Aung San Suu Kyi.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that on the issue of trade sanctions, which Senator Chamarette mentioned in her motion, which we have mentioned in our amendment and which Senator Hill has mentioned in paragraph 4 of his, it is not unreasonable to give fair warning that, if the present repression and imprisonment of political prisoners continues in Burma, at an appropriate time, irrespective of what ASEAN countries or other countries may do, Australia reserves the right to take trade sanctions in a positive way against Burma.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I agree with Senator Hill. It is very hard to say exactly when you should apply sanctions, how much encouragement you should give the SLORC to change, how much of a carrot you would give and how much stick you would use along the way. How much carrot you give and how much stick you use is a balanced judgment. I have no doubt that you cannot get the SLORC to change by offering them pure carrot, because they will take that as a vindication that they do not have to change. That is the ASEAN position, by and large. I do not think that will be successful. I also believe that if you have an absolute reliance on the stick, without offering the SLORC a way out to save some face for the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1765"> change, you will not get the change. So in the Australian parliament I think we always have to try to argue that we have the balance about right. There are shades of grey in it. I think from time to time we have to be ready to change our judgment according to circumstances as they evolve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to conclude on one very personal point about Burma. When I was chairman of the first human rights committee of this parliament, I dedicated the first report that we produced to a young man I met in Burma in 1989. He was Maung Maung Kywe, who, as a 16-year-old high school student at the local high school in Rangoon during the demonstrations of 1988, organised every day for the high school students to march in the streets to demonstrate for democracy. I have to say that that took a lot of courage, because a number of them were shot and killed, arrested and tortured, some of them were murdered in prison and some of them just disappeared. Despite those threats, those young high school students still marched in the streets every day knowing what the threats to them were.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I met him when he was on the run in Burma as a dissenter. Every day he would go down to the marketplace and surreptitiously hand out leaflets calling for democracy, knowing that if he was caught he would probably get, at the very least, very rough treatment. When I asked him why he was doing this, he said, `I want to have democracy for Burma.' When I asked him what that meant, he said, `It means I get the right to elect the government I want, and in three or four years time I get the right to unelect it if I disagree with it.' I thought, `I studied politics for three years at Adelaide University and that is a good enough description of democracy for me,' which I got from a 16-year-old kid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I returned in 1992 and asked quietly the woman who at one stage gave him shelter if I could meet him. She informed me that he had been killed fighting for democracy in Burma. I must say that that was one of the most awful moments I had in my political life, because only a few minutes later I had to go and have dinner with the colonels of the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> SLORC, those responsible without doubt for his death. I thought it only reasonable that he get some memory somewhere else in the world, in an Australian parliamentary document, about his contribution to democracy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For us this is a resolution of words. As Bill Hayden said, in diplomacy words are bullets. They are the ones that make the change. We should recognise that in Burma literally tens of thousands of people have quite courageously paid with their lives to try to get democracy for that country. No matter how little the time we take from time to time in this place to support those very brave people, including the memory of Maung Maung Kywe, I think we should do it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that the motions we have before us are very adequate for the occasion. This is an occasion for Aung San Suu Kyi personally in which we recognise that she is one of the great figures for human rights and democracy in the world.</PARA></SPEECH>

The main theme of what has been said so far in this debate&mdash;I do not think it will go on for much longer&mdash;is that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi is one of the world's great heroes. I think that everybody in this chamber would say the same; in fact, probably most people in Australia would say the same. We do wish her as happy a birthday as she can possibly have under the circumstances of her current habitation in Burma.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been a member of the Human Rights Subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence, and Trade almost since it was started. I think that I missed the first meeting before I was actually put on to that committee. We have looked at Burma over the years, from 1990 until now. We handed down a quite short but fairly thorough report, a quite recent one, in the last parliament on the situation in Burma and human rights in Burma.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report demonstrated that human rights in Burma is at an abysmally low level. It has to be one of the worst places, as Senator Schacht said, in the world today for human rights. Forced labour is everywhere. The army <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1766"> just picks civilians out from villages anywhere&mdash;anyone they feel like. It does not matter how old you are, how young you are, whether you are pregnant, or whether you have small children. Nothing matters. If you are an individual who can carry what the army needs to be carried, then you are picked up out of the village and you just go with the army.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You just drop everything&mdash;your children, your ageing grandfather; you may be the aging grandfather&mdash;and you go with the army until either they decide they do not need you, which does not happen all that often, or you drop dead, which does happen far too often. Forced labour is a real and very destructive problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Talking of destruction, there is also the destruction of entire villages, the burning of villages. If anybody is suspected of being against the SLORC, then the entire village might go. There is torture all the time, everywhere. There is repression and pervasive fear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">About four years ago I asked the then foreign minister Senator Gareth Evans where the heroin on Australian streets came from. I think that the answer was that about 80 per cent of it comes from Burma. There are plenty of heroin poppy&hyphen;growing areas in South-East Asia, outside Burma. If 80 per cent of it comes from within Burma then there is a reason for that. The reason is not just that that is the best area to grow the heroin poppy. The reason must be that it is easier to get the heroin out of Burma, and there must be a reason for that too. Burma is an absolute disaster area. But it well and truly should not be. The reason that it is is obviously the SLORC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember the first time that I heard the term `SLORC'. I think it was in 1990. To Senator Schacht, who at the time was the chair of the Joint Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee, I said: `What a dreadful acronym. Fancy calling something the SLORC. It sounds like a horrible, enormous squishy monster that comes and gets you.' Senator Schacht said, `Yes, it is an enormous, squishy monster that comes and gets you. It is a very accurate acronym for this body.' And it is.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is one of the most dreadful regimes in the world today. If we cannot agree in this parliament that we should take extremely strong action against such a repressive regime, then we have a problem. If there is any regime in our region that we should be taking incredibly strong action against, this is it. It is very obvious.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have two motions and an amendment in front of me at the moment, and I would say that I agree with everything in all of them. I think that we do have to take action with countries around the world. That is essential. The Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Hill) is absolutely right when he says that. I also agree with Senator Schacht when he says that we have to tell the SLORC that we are now  considering whether trade sanctions ought to be on the agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have to know that we are not going to just sit here forever and put up with what they are doing. What they are doing is wrong. It is not right. They have to have very, very strong signals from this parliament that what they are doing is wrong. We have to be able to tell them that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things Senator Hill said at the end of his remarks was that we will feel good if we pass some of the things in this motion but they will not achieve anything. That is an interesting comment coming from somebody who is a minister and who has been in opposition. I do not actually expect to be a minister in the near future. I expect to be in opposition for a fair while.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We would have preferred it if the motion moved by Senator Chamarette with our amendment were the only resolution. We have no objection to the items in Senator Hill's amendment&mdash;in the spirit of giving everyone a place in the sun on this issue, there can be no objection to the content of Senator Hill's amendment&mdash;but we believe that Senator Chamarette's motion, as amended by our amendment, puts greater pressure on SLORC. There is nothing untoward or unreasonably negative about Senator Hill's amendment but, because of SLORC's recent actions, we want to take things a step further, putting a bit more stick on SLORC rather than a bit more carrot.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Hill said he was a bit concerned about the reference to scorched earth tactics with the burning of villages in Kayah state. We do not have the exact number of villages that were burnt down but over the last seven years more than enough atrocities have been committed to fill pages of a resolution. The <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1769"> reference in this motion is modestly put so I do not think it is a real problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Hill also referred to that part of the motion that welcomes the moves of the state legislature of Massachusetts. He was concerned that we do not have the actual wording of its resolution. It is not an unusual practice in this place to quote in shorthand the resolution of another organisation, be it the United Nations, UNESCO or the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. I do not think we should be embarrassed about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My amendment to Senator Chamarette's motion puts SLORC on notice, and I think that is reasonable at this particular time. SLORC should be aware that there are members of this parliament who are willing to take the next step unless there is an improvement in the situation. I believe that is a useful mixture of carrot and stick to SLORC on this issue. Although it might appear in parliamentary terms a bit clumsy to have two separate resolutions, it means that Senator Hill has succeeded with his amendment on behalf of the government while the Senate as a whole has carried another resolution which is a bit stronger.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All in all, I think the government has addressed this issue well today. Although we might be going a bit further than Senator Hill would have liked, the general thrust of what this parliament is doing is more than acceptable to the Australian people; I think they would demand this level of action. If Radio Australia and the other national radio programs can broadcast the outcome of this motion, there will be many millions of people in Burma who will welcome it as a sign of support and a sign that they are not forgotten.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>The object of this report was to examine the allegations of improper bond trading by the investment committee of the Reserve Bank of Australia Officers' Superannuation Fund, referred to as OSF. The committee recognised the important position of the Reserve Bank of Australia in the economic life of Australia. Accordingly, it regards as crucial the upholding of the Reserve Bank's integrity in all its aspects. On the evidence before it, the committee is satisfied that the integrity has been both upheld and been seen to be upheld.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the committee's view, perceptions are integral to public confidence, and public confidence in our financial institutions is fundamental to our financial system as a whole. Thus, the committee felt that it was imperative to deal with the concerns that were raised. The committee believes that this inquiry has done that comprehensively, and those concerns have been demonstrated to be without merit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a very thorough coverage, the committee heard evidence from Mr Bernie Fraser, the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Alan Cameron, the Chairman of the Australian Securities Commission, and Mr Pat Barrett, the Commonwealth Auditor&hyphen;General. We found that the original allegations could not be sustained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the seriousness of the allegations of insider trading, the committee felt it was imperative to deal with the concerns that had been raised. The committee has demonstrated that the allegations have been completely without merit, and they have been now laid to rest. I thank the Senate.</PARA>

<STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(10.48 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was in mid&hyphen;sentence when my speech was interrupted last night. The remaining part of the sentence refers to the AIIA, the Australian Information Industries Association, which, in surveys of its membership, found that the multiplier for this scheme was a multiplication of one to 30. The best example of the multiplier that the EMDG scheme provides is set out in evidence to the Senate <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> committee by Mr Oliver of Austrade, who said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The multiplier found by Professor Bewley, who headed that evaluation, showed that across the scheme, if you considered all claimants, it is 10 to one additional exports. So last year just a touch under $200 million was paid out under the scheme. That in turn generated $2 billion worth of incremental exports. That is the assumption. If you look at claimants that are what we call `experienced' in the scheme&mdash;and they would be claimants from year three onwards and have some export experience&mdash;the multiplier is up to 25 to one, depending upon the industry and the number of years that the company has been in the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA>The multiplier is an effective one. This scheme makes money for Australia. That is the first of my two points that I want to make at this stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point is that the EMDG scheme is taxed. The government gets back&mdash;according to the findings of the report calculated by Professor Bewley&mdash;42 per cent of all its outlays. Therefore, in the year 1994-95, where the outlay was $211 million, the Australian government only outlaid $122.38 million. Given the projection that the outlay in the year 1998-99 will be $292 million, it will really be $169.36 million&mdash;$88.62 million and $122.64 million on those two figures respectively will be returned to general revenue for other uses by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just want to emphasis those two points. The multiplier shows that this is an effective scheme. Forty&hyphen;two per cent of the outlays, according to the most recent calculation, are returned to the government in revenue. So when we focus on the total cost of the scheme, reduce that by 42 per cent because that is the real cost to the government of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More importantly, though, the export market development scheme has to be compared not to its performance domestically in the Australian economy or costs to the government for running the scheme, or indeed even the multiplier, but rather to what other countries in the world provide to their companies, because we are now in the globalised economy. Australian industry competes on the world market. If Australians are not supported by their government and companies from <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1771"> other countries are, we are therefore at a commercial disadvantage in foreign markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No evidence has been provided to us as to what the other schemes in nations competing with Australia are, but what is known anecdotally by me is that there are a number of huge industry supports to companies in Japan, Italy, France, Germany, the USA and Britain&mdash;schemes that actually help those exporters win markets. If you were to diminish this scheme or remove it, it would be like asking Australians to compete in the Olympic Games over the 100 metres event in Blundstone boots saying to them that the extra handicap that they carry is an incentive to do better. It is a mockery; it is a joke, and the government is aware of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think those facts speak for themselves. This scheme is vital for the health of the export sector. Why industry is concerned&mdash;concerned in some detail about this bill but concerned, more importantly, about the intentions of the government&mdash;is that the rumours everywhere are that the scheme will be abolished. The government cannot sit back and say, `You can't assume that it will be,' because these are inspired rumours; they are leaks from within the bureaucracy; they are leaks from within government meetings. What has been transmitted to corporate Australia is a view that the future of this scheme is uncertain. Therefore, can you expect Australian companies to invest money in the exercise where this scheme actually repays them on their efforts while there is uncertainty hanging over it and they may not get their money back?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The very existence of the rumours about the future of this scheme is denying the impact the scheme provides for Australia in foreign trade. Indeed, given the level of the current account deficit, you would wonder why anyone with a smart brain or even half a smart brain would give source to those rumours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there are sustained leaks, and it is not just about the EMDG scheme. It is about the DIFF scheme; it is about the 150 per cent tax deduction for research and development; it is about NIES; and it is about a whole range of industry support schemes&mdash;all of which <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> undercut the confidence of industry about the security of those schemes in the future and lead to a more conservative approach by it. Of course, I will not go now into the mythical black hole that these cuts are supposed to feed, but it is passing strange and odd in the extreme that a government would stunt growth in order to balance its budget when it can balance its budget by accelerating growth and getting higher returns from its tax base as a consequence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is important that every company in Australia realises that the Commonwealth government, the coalition, backed down in the face of state pressure on sales tax on motor vehicles. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) backed down at an NFF meeting on diesel fuel rebate and rural research and development by giving them a wink and a nod that those two schemes for that sector will remain. It does show that there is some give by the government if significant pressure is applied. I simply encourage Australian companies and their industry associations to apply that pressure to protect this scheme. The letters of protest have been many, but I think the efforts can be redoubled and made sure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I say that if the scheme is diminished or abolished we will oppose it, I say that with a considerable degree of weight. One of the leaks that came to me was that on 4 June the ERC met and decided that they would impose a 24.3 per cent cut in running costs for Austrade. Austrade administer this scheme. If their running costs were cut by a quarter, the ability to administer this scheme at maximum efficiency, despite the redoubtable skills of the administration capability of Austrade, would be called into question. Companies would be waiting a lot longer for payment and that, of course, exposes them to high interest on the borrowings that they may have undertaken to finance their activities in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even if the scheme is kept intact but Austrade is savaged, we will oppose all of that. We will oppose it because of itself it ought to be opposed. Importantly as well, the government in its election promises&mdash;and I want to make this point with as maximum emphasis as I can&mdash;said that it would enhance <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1772"> this scheme. It did so by the Hon. Tim Fischer MP, the then shadow minister for trade, who spoke at the National Press Club on 15 February 1996. It was repeated on pages 1 and 8 of the coalition's industry and commerce policy document, released by the Hon. John Moore MP. Of course, some industry associations, in evidence to the inquiry, said that they had spoken to Mr Fischer about that, and he gave them assurances that the scheme would not be tampered with. If it is, the government is repudiating its election promise. That will give us perfect right to defend the scheme and hold the government to what it told the electorate at election time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make this comment to the government: the government should not assume that, because this is a bill we introduced when we were in office, we will support it now. It should never assume that, because we did not make the election undertakings that you made. Many of the industry associations before the inquiry said that when they heard those election undertakings they did not assume that this government, the current government, would pursue these changes. What was told to those industry associations, if you go back to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of the hearing, suggests that they have perfect grounds for saying that. I make the point that not all said it, but some said it. There is a degree of ambiguity about it, so the government should stand by its industry undertakings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing that is clear from the hearing is that this government had not consulted any of the industry. The evidence is that when we were in government we did consult about this proposal, but this government did not. Therefore, there is that reasonable question of whether they ever intended to proceed with the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of matters which I am going to have to pursue in the committee stage of this bill concerning the actual detail of the proposals put before the chamber. I just quickly say, in the few minutes available to me now, that what is clear in reducing the maximum per annum grant from $250,000 to $200,000 is that the government has not consulted industry on that. There is some <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> information known about the number of companies affected in the band $200,000 to $250,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you look at the industry break&hyphen;up of the evidence given to the inquiry by Austrade, the industry sector most seriously affected is the manufacturing sector. That is the one in which we have had the maximum growth in exports over the last several years under the previous Labor government, and it would appear that this would be the group that would be most severely affected by reducing the ceiling. However, I make the point that that has not been looked at by this government, nor has the impact been looked at on the small business area, where they can conglomerate together such as they do in the furniture industry and present themselves as an association and get that ceiling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other area of importance is administrative complexity. This government promised the electorate in stentorian terms that it would reduce red tape on business by 50 per cent. This bill actually increases it. The evidence from everyone is unanimous on that point. This is the voice of business saying, `You are now increasing red tape on us,' and this government is proceeding to do that. While I understand that Austrade is having consultations to try to make that easier, it is still a load that business will bear and is in itself a deterrent to business in actually applying for the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My time is up. There are a lot of other things I would like to say, but I conclude on this point: we will give passage to this bill, but it will be with the major reservations I have referred to. If the scheme is abolished, we will oppose it tooth and nail all the way down the line.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996. The purpose of the bill is to reduce from $250,000 to $200,000 the maximum grant payable to applicants other than an approved trading house, to introduce a series of measures to improve accountability and risk measurement and to introduce registration and grants entry testing of first time claimants. In fact, that testing&mdash;the so&hyphen;called <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1773"> market readiness test&mdash;tries to establish whether or not a particular business is strong enough to maintain its export push. Savings are estimated to be in the order of $32 million between 1996 and 1999 and have already been incorporated in the forward estimates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill must be seen in the context of this government's overall trade and industry policy, which even its own minister has described as `dreadful' in certain aspects that have been put forward since this government took office. During the campaign the Liberal and National parties assured voters that they attached `a high priority to the effective allocation of funding that assists the growth of Australian exports through providing support to businesses' and they vowed to introduce changes which would introduce a greater level of coherence and accountability into these programs. This bill introduces greater complexity but it is very doubtful whether it introduces a greater level of coherence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition has said that the role of Austrade and the range of export assistance packages offered to businesses is a cornerstone in the processes of developing an export culture. Yet since then we have seen or heard little but repeated threats and speculation about the axing or severe curtailing of trade and industry assistance programs now lambasted as business welfare, irrespective of the national benefit these schemes have rendered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has seemingly turned its back on its pre&hyphen;election commitment to develop a strong proactive and interventionist industry and trade policy. No longer does the government appear intent on building upon and enhancing existing support programs which clearly underpin economic growth, encourage exports, reduce the current account deficit, create jobs and contribute to greater public savings by increasing the tax revenue. Instead, we hear of cuts to the export market development grants scheme, the development import finance facility scheme, the research and development tax concession and the tariff concession scheme. It is unfortunate that the government is trying to please financial markets by cutting $8 billion from the deficit <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> but is doing so without any discernible rational policy framework.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bert Evans, Chief Executive of the Metal Trades Industry Association, has said that addressing Australia's national saving problem:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . by way of cutting our nation's productive and export capacity will render only a short term book&hyphen;keeper's benefit . . . Cutting these schemes is not saving. On the contrary, we are contemplating cutting public investment in programs which currently make important contributions to national saving through their positive impact on exports, and ultimately, on the current account deficit.</PARA>
<PARA>One can only say, `Hear, hear!' Such concerns have been echoed by the Premier of Victoria, Jeff Kennett, who attacked the Commonwealth government over these projected cuts, claiming they would discourage business investment and possibly stall national economic growth. I am delighted to be able to put on record that I wholeheartedly agree with Premier Jeff Kennett.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0X4">Senator SPINDLER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And in a very limited ambit of the statements that he is making, Senator Cooney. Mr Kennett said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You only have to talk to the federal ministers up there to know that they're going to these expenditure revenue meetings and they're being told what to do. Treasury mandarins are now back in control and must be laughing themselves stupid.</PARA>
<PARA>As I said, for once I am able to wholeheartedly agree with Mr Jeff Kennett. The ACTU and the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union have joined industry critics and have warned that Australia risks losing $4.5 billion a year of net exports by the year 2000 and up to 80,000 jobs if the government proceeds with plans to scrap trade and industry programs. The fact is that governments have an important role to play in the economy and in support of small business&mdash;a role the present government is doing its utmost to shirk. It is not surprising therefore that the government's policy inconsistencies are reflected in its approach to the export market development scheme. Even as it is threatening to cut the scheme out, the government is seeking amendments to improve it and to make it more cost&hyphen;effective.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1774">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One is, indeed, tempted to vote against the whole bill, to say, `What's the use,' and, in effect, to challenge the government to come back when it has irrevocably decided to continue it, as it certainly should. However, it is hard to imagine that even this government would wish to damage Australia's efforts to reduce our current account deficit. The Democrats will, therefore, address the substance of the government's bill and the measures it is proposing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I do that, let me put one more suggestion to the government which it may wish to incorporate in its further considerations of this scheme. It is one that the Australian Democrats have often raised, that is the threshold entry figure, which is currently at $30,000. Very clearly, when that was introduced it cut out a lot of people in small business, including those who are not able to get together into consortia to benefit from the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some areas in industry which continue to be in that position. We have had representations from recording artists in the industry producing CDs who are struggling to hold their own against Sony and other major competitors with ample capital to support their efforts. Recording artists, however, are usually individuals with very little capital strength and substance who are facing costs in producing their recordings which further sap their capacity. I believe the government should give consideration in its further examination of the scheme to allowing a lower threshold in particular circumstances such as the one I have described.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The EMDG scheme was established in 1974 and is the government's major export incentive program designed to encourage small and medium business enterprises to seek out and develop export markets and to promote an export culture in the business community. Administered by Austrade, the scheme currently provides cash grants of up to $250,000 per annum for approved enterprises and is based primarily on expenditure incurred by an Australian person or company seeking to create or expand exports of their products in overseas markets.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apart from two insignificant changes, the bill is the same as the one introduced by the former government in November last year but which lapsed with the dissolution of parliament. The present parliament has signalled that it may further amend or, as I have said before, even abolish the scheme in the context of the forthcoming budget deliberations and that any such decision will not be influenced at all by the introduction of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats hope that it will be influenced by the passage of this bill because, like the opposition, the Democrats are saying we will grant this bill passage with some reservations and some concerns which we will ask the minister to address. But we are doing so with the expectation that the government will come to its senses and continue this scheme after it has been adjusted to make it yet more cost-effective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill was sent to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee. A common concern among witnesses concerned the grants entry test or market readiness, which it was felt would introduce an additional level of administrative delays and costs and undermine the non&hyphen;discretionary nature of the scheme by allowing Austrade officials to determine whether an exporter is ready to export.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The market readiness test is introduced by schedule 9 of the bill, administered and formulated by Austrade and which first time applicants will be required to pass. For claimants who fail, the test is to serve as a diagnostic instrument to facilitate counselling and referral to appropriate services. It is the view of the Democrats that this counselling, referral, support, advice and so on should be available at all times, not just when a company is diagnosed as being likely to fail. We should not let companies get to that point and through Austrade we should provide the means of support for our export industries to continue that push overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The screening mechanism is designed to filter out those with little chance of success thereby reducing the number of firms dropping out of the scheme at a later stage before they progress to graduation after eight years. The drop&hyphen;out rate is of concern because it <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1775"> indicates a failure to develop export markets and possibly an ineffective use of public funds. To that extent, we certainly share the government's concerns in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, we are being asked to approve a test which will be administered by public servants who are not necessarily experienced in business. It is a fairly subjective test at the moment on the basis of the information that we have before us. We were very tempted to delete the market readiness provisions by an amendment. However, we have been provided with a list of the criteria that the government intends to develop in consultation with industry. While at the moment the list is little more than that, it simply enumerates the various factors that will be looked at.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have already suggested to the minister&mdash;and I repeat the statement here in the chamber&mdash;that we would expect the government to produce a list of criteria which is clear, detailed and appealable so that a business which is rejected on the basis of that test can appeal to the AAT if the judgment that is made by the person concerned in the department is found to be wanting. We have been assured that these criteria will be provided to the Senate as a disallowable instrument. I certainly suggest to the minister that the Democrats will reject that instrument if it does not measure up to the test we are suggesting; namely, that it is objective and detailed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that once again the applicants, particularly those in the category which is considered to be doubtful, should be supported by advice and training on information rather than be closed out of the scheme. I would like to receive some more information and assurances from the minister on that point when he responds later in this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one other provision that has caused us some concern; that is, a reduction in the grant level from $250,000 to $200,000, which was stated by many to be retrospective in its application to people who are already in the system.

<PARA>That, in any terms, surely is an adequate and indeed an excellent return for the investment of public funds. Since our whole efforts in our industries should be directed towards improving our balance of payments and to becoming competitive in international markets, it would be suicidal indeed for the government to remove that particular scheme.

<PARA>This bill before the Senate today is a very important one&mdash;not so much because of the terms of the bill but because of the debate that surrounds the future of the export market development grants scheme in this country. The scheme provides cash grants to assist Australian exporters in seeking out and developing export markets. Exporters are reimbursed 50 per cent of overseas marketing expenses above $30,000. The scheme's primary purpose is to support small to medium sized companies in their export endeavours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill we are considering today is identical to one introduced by the previous Labor government and the amendments contained therein seek to limit grants payable from $250,000 to $100,000 maximum, to introduce a grants entry test to limit grants to higher risk applicants and to provide greater guidance to small exporters, and to introduce accountability and legal measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill has been considered by the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee. The inquiry conducted by that committee was very useful in allowing industry to voice its concerns, not only about the bill we are considering today but also about the future of the scheme and the government's reluctance to endorse the future of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The particular concerns with the bill have been well covered by Senator Spindler from Victoria in his speech, particularly the concern about the new grants entry tests. Senator Spindler indicated that some assurances have been given regarding the use of regulations in this regard. I am sure the Senate will closely monitor those to ensure that the scheme continues to operate successfully and fairly. Despite the loss of Senator Spindler from the Senate after 1 July, I can assure him that we will be keeping a very close eye on the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason I decided to participate in this debate today was the concern of industry groups in my own state of Western Australia and elsewhere about the future of the scheme. They are concerned that the government is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> intending in the budget to either abolish the EMDG scheme or severely reduce its application. This concern is very real and has been heightened by the failure of various ministers to give any assurances to industry about the future of the scheme. I understand that there is always a bit of pre-budget argy-bargy and a normal policy of ministers to `neither confirm nor deny', but this scheme is very important to the future of high-tech and manufacturing industries in Australia. It is vital to the development of our export culture. I really do think that on this occasion the government ought to give an unequivocal commitment to the future of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This scheme has been a success. There are various industry assistance programs where people can have a legitimate argument about their efficacy and success. This particular scheme is not one of these. Introduced by the Whitlam government in 1974, it has been almost an unqualified success. In the last financial year, 3,500 companies utilised the EMDG scheme. Ninety per cent were small businesses with turnovers of less than $5 million. Twenty per cent had turnovers of less than $1 million. They were predominantly high technology and information technology companies&mdash;the smart companies that are needed to take Australia's economy forward. We heard at the Senate committee inquiry of the many success stories, where the assistance provided by this scheme had allowed companies to expand into markets that they would not otherwise have been able to access.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The EMDG scheme has been reviewed on a number of occasions. On each occasion the reviews have found that the scheme has been working well. Despite some modifications, it has continued to provide very beneficial assistance to industries in broadening their export markets. The last review in 1994 again showed that the scheme was meeting its objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1777"> I wish to stress quite clearly that the EMDG is not a handout to companies. Firms must spend at least $30,000 before becoming eligible for the scheme and often do not receive any moneys for two years. High levels of commitment from the company are re quired. It is a partnership rather than a handout.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has also been found that the scheme is very cost effective. Austrade estimates that for every $1 spent on EMDG $25 is generated in exports. The 1994 Price Waterhouse review for Austrade that Senator Spindler referred to found that the net cost of the scheme was only 58 per cent of the amount spent on grants. That is around $115 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The study found that 42 per cent of the cost of the scheme was recouped by the government because of the tax payable on the grants themselves and the additional exports generated. With the EMDG, Austrade estimates that the annual IT&amp;T and multimedia sector exports to North America will rise from $60 million in 1996 to $140 million in the year 2000. Without it, the exciting proposition of breaking into the lucrative North American market will be stifled. So the scheme is providing real success and very tangible benefits for the Australian economy and for our trade performance. The coalition, prior to the election, seemed to recognise this. The coalition trade policy, `Meeting the Challenges', at page 30 stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will maintain the export market development grants scheme.</PARA>
<PARA>That view was confirmed by Tim Fischer at the National Press Club on 15 February 1996 when he said: `EMDG stays,' in a style that only Tim Fischer can bring to such things. The reasons why there is concern about the future of the scheme are numerous. I suppose at the back of people's minds is the fact that the Liberal Party went to the 1987 federal election with a policy of seeking to abolish the scheme. There is a widely held view that Treasury has some concerns with the scheme and would rather see it largely amended or scrapped. I think the recent abolition of the DIFF scheme has heightened industry concerns about the whole future of industry assistance measures. The government's constant mantra about the $8 billion black hole and the search for easy targets for cuts means that generally people are concerned about a range of government assistance schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> There is enormous industry concern that the scheme may be abolished. This was highlight ed in the evidence given to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee when we inquired into this bill. I quote Mr Peter Campbell of the Australian Publishers Association, who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Last year we studied with great interest the policy statements of both parties and took great comfort from the fact that both the coalition and the Labor government promised to continue the scheme into the year 1999. As well as that, our industry group had a meeting with the then shadow minister Mr Fischer, who gave us his personal insurance that the scheme would continue to that date. We received a letter from him last week which concluded by saying `The process, as you say, has still not been resolved and will be an ongoing process. Consequently, I am not able to comment on the future of the scheme.'</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Russell Chandler, from the Australian Institute of Export, expressed concern also. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We can only assume that this extreme action is being contemplated by the Expenditure Review Committee on the basis of ignorance of the scheme, its needs, benefits and history, poor departmental advice, a perceived lack of support in relation to the other areas of potential cost cutting, or on the basis of pre-existing attitudes to government supported schemes in general.</PARA>
<PARA>These are just indications of the widespread industry concern at the implications of the elimination of the EMDG scheme. There were a number of submissions to the committee which gave very telling evidence as to the success of the scheme. I was particularly struck by the submission from the Lonely Planet book publishing company that talked about their particular history of involvement with the scheme and their experience of taking Australian publishing and Australian ingenuity to new markets. A range of companies like that gave very real, very concrete examples of how the scheme had assisted their firms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People need to be aware of the implications of the elimination of this scheme. In the last 10 years Australia's trade and export performance has been significant in the development of the economy of this country. Exports have more than doubled: $39 million to $92 billion. Most of that growth has been in non-traditional areas. Services exports trebled to $21 billion and manufactured exports grew <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1778"> fivefold to $17.5 billion. The export boom in manufactures and services has added almost $30 billion a year to Australia's output and perhaps created as many as 500,000 jobs. If it continues to grow at anything like the rates of the past 10 years, the next tranche of benefits will be two to three times that size.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the scheme is eliminated, either companies will move offshore to take advantage of the concessional tax arrangements for high-tech firms in other countries, which will result in jobs being lost as companies relocate offshore, or companies will simply exploit local markets and ignore the opportunities presented by overseas markets. Companies do need assistance to take that step to develop those export markets. The scheme is not a handout; there is an important role and a justifiable role for governments to play in assisting those companies to build their markets and, therefore, to build jobs and income for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Government policy of the past decade has placed a priority on encouraging companies to look at export opportunities. At a time when this culture is starting to impact on Australian business, the prospects of this government turning its back on industry are very alarming indeed. Mr Trevor Tappendan, of Ernst &amp; Young, National Entrepreneurial Services Division, has said recently:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The EMDG has been a saviour to Australian small businesses getting into new export markets. It has created an environment for them to increase our exports.</PARA>
<PARA>I cannot believe the government would be so stupid as to damage something that has brought such good results. Senator Spindler also referred to the recent report put out by the ACTU and the AMWU entitled `A Preliminary Assessment of the Coalition's Proposed Cuts to Trade and Industry Development Assistance', which looked at the impact of abolishing industry development programs. It highlighted the potential loss of jobs, loss of growth of new exports and the range of flow-on effects that come from that. In summary that report estimated that, if all the mooted cuts were implemented, there would be a potential loss of $4,500 million to the GDP in lost import replacement and export <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> expansion and a potential loss of up to 80,000 jobs from Australian industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are very important considerations in relation to the scheme and in relation to government policy generally. They are about supporting industry and export market development. From a WA perspective, I know there is a large range of Western Australian companies that have benefited from the scheme as they have sought to expand into markets, particularly in South-East Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A large number of high technology companies have been involved. It is interesting also that a large number of companies and activities associated with the WA universities have been beneficiaries of the scheme as we try to move into smart industries and develop Australian industry in new directions. EMDG has been a very important scheme for a range of companies in Western Australia. I have been impressed by the submissions I have received from those companies and from others who see the scheme as being highly desirable and effective in allowing them to grow and develop exports for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is real concern on this side of the chamber regarding the axing of the EMDG, especially following the government's announced plans to abolish other industry development programs such as the development import finance facility. We have used this debate today to express those concerns. The amendment I have moved on behalf of Senator Cook goes to the heart of those concerns. It reiterates the success of the scheme in enhancing our export performance, in creating jobs and providing a successful export incentive for small and medium&hyphen;sized businesses. The amendment also expresses its concern at the mooted abolition of the scheme. Finally, the amendment seeks to condemn the government for its failure to meet its election commitment to extend the EMDG scheme by making full export market development grants of 50 per cent available to the tourism industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1779"> The amendment moved by the opposition today is not addressing strictly the clauses of the bill, but is designed to give voice to the industry concerns and our very real concerns about the future of the scheme and the poten tial for the government in the budget process to do real damage to Australian export markets. I think it will be useful if I refer briefly to a quote by one of the economic writers, Tim Colebatch, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>. Talking about these sorts of schemes and the government's  attitude, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What is alarming in the coalition's policies and Budget agenda is the evident lack of any strategy for ensuring they will continue&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>`they', of course, being the trade and industry programs we have been referring to. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Trade and industry programs are being tossed up as targets for the axe with no sign that ministers . . . are weighing their importance to achieving the growth the Coalition and Australia need.</PARA>
<PARA>It is for this reason that we have taken the opportunity, in debating this bill today, to make the very strong point that the export market development grants scheme is fundamental to expanding our export markets, particularly in high technology areas, and assisting a range of industries in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are very strongly supportive of the scheme and we urge the government to continue and expand the scheme following its budget deliberations. If there is any attempt to downgrade or abolish the scheme, the opposition will be taking a very serious view of that and doing all in its powers to assist industry in maintaining the scheme.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;An essential dimension of this debate, as appears from what has been said by the speakers before me, concerns an apprehension, an anxiety or fear, about the future of this scheme. This is not a good thing. Australian industry and commerce, some of which have been referred to in the previous speech by Senator Evans, are entitled to be reassured about the future of the scheme. It seems to me that that has been the matter that has concerned everybody who has turned their mind to this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps the best way of going about the debate is to refer to the report from the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee. That is a committee of this chamber, and it is another indication of just <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> how successful the committee system is for the proper processing of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The chair of that committee is Senator Judith Troeth, who, I think you would agree, is a most competent and experienced chair. She was previously chair of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, which I now have the honour of heading. I know how good she is from the work that she has done there. The other members of the government party who are on that committee are Senator David MacGibbon and Senator Baden Teague, people with vast experience. They came into this chamber even before you and I came into it, you with considerable grace, Madam Acting President Knowles. The two people from the opposition party who are on that committee are Senator Cook and Senator Evans, from both of whom we have heard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point I want to make is that that was an all-party committee with the coalition parties being in the majority. It is interesting to see what they have to say. They turn to the question of the background to this scheme and that has already been described. It would be worthwhile, I think, for the purposes of those listening, to hear what the committee had to say about it. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Export Market Development Grants (EMDG) Scheme is established by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Export Market Development Grants Act 1974</EMPHASIS>  and is managed by Austrade. It provides taxable cash grants to assist Australian exporters in seeking out and developing export markets. Exporters are reimbursed 50 per cent of overseas marketing expenses in excess of $15 000 having attained a minimum expenditure threshold of $30 000 for that year. The Scheme's primary purpose is to support small to medium sized companies in their export endeavours. Companies who record export sales above $25 million a year are ineligible to apply for a grant.</PARA>
<PARA>That theme has been developed by previous speakers. The general thrust of it is that this is a scheme to help small to medium&hyphen;sized Australian companies enter overseas markets. On the face of it, it is quite an outstanding scheme. It is a scheme which has been operating since the 1970s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that this bill has been introduced and contemplates the continuation of the scheme&mdash;though a continuation in a different way in the sense that there is less money <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1780"> available than there was before&mdash;would indicate that the scheme is to continue. You would have thought that people would have had faith in the government continuing the scheme on the basis that the government has introduced legislation very similar to what was introduced by the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the report that I have referred to from the committee that was chaired by Senator Troeth is read it becomes quite clear that the people who gave evidence to the committee are quite fearful of the future of the scheme. It is proper that I read paragraph 12 of the report, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In evidence to the Committee two areas of concern were raised: first, matters relating to aspects of the Bill including the impact of the reduction of the grant, the grants entry test, a possible increase in the complexity of the administration of the Scheme and the possible retrospective application of the amendments; and secondly, the question of the continuity of the Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA>Later in the report&mdash;at paragraphs 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49 and 50&mdash;the issue of the continuity of the scheme is developed. It is too long for me to read it during this speech, but the whole thrust of it is that industry is clearly concerned about the future of the scheme. As we heard from the people who have debated this issue today, and Senator Cook who debated it last night, this is causing great uncertainty in commerce and industry. It is not right that commerce and industry should be kept in that state of apprehension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the give and take across this chamber when the opposition seeks to find out what is going to happen in terms of expenditure for the purpose of gaining a political point, it is reasonable for the government to fence that approach and say, `Well, wait and see.' But that proposition, which may be correct in terms of the political exchange across the chamber, is not a proposition that has any validity where commerce and industry are concerned. The people who provide the lifeblood of this country, the people who manufacture, the people who produce services, the people who sell those services and the people who provide the wealth of this country are entitled to get a clear message from government. That clear message should come at the earliest opportunity. It should not <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> be held up simply to gain a political advantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There may be some other reason why the government refuses to give assurances to the people who produce the wealth of this country. I see Senator Herron across the chamber, a person to whom we must give great respect. If he is responding to this issue, he might tell those people in Australia who want to know about the future of their business exactly why no clear message can be given now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps I should indicate to Senator Herron, through you, Madam Acting Deputy President, the people who did give evidence at this hearing. They include the Australian Business Chamber, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Australian Chamber of Manufactures, the Australian Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers Association Ltd, the Australian Publishers Association, the Australian Institute of Export (NSW) Ltd, the Australian Information Industries Association, Blades Mi&hyphen;Sporting Products Pty Ltd, Export and Commercial Research Services Pty Ltd, the Furnishing Association of Australia Ltd, Lonely Planet Publications Pty Ltd, the MTIA, Sunlovers Cruises, the Tasmanian Apple and Pear Growers Association and the Tourism Council Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That list covers a very broad range of industry and commerce in this country, including information industries, sporting products, Lonely Planet Publications, tourism, the metal industries, the business chamber and so on. All these people and all these groups have expressed, as I understand this report, an apprehension about the future. That apprehension is apparently not to be taken from them until, at the very earliest, 20 August.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is in that context that the amendment moved by Senator Chris Evans on behalf of Senator Cook is made. I will just go through the amendment. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the end of motion add ", but the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) is of the opinion that the EMDG scheme is:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> (i) a successful scheme which enhances Australia's export performance,</PARA>
<PARA>Nobody could disagree with that. I would not have thought that, since at this stage the government is going to continue the scheme, there would be any problem with everybody agreeing with that. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> (ii) a source of job creation and benefits Australia's balance of payments&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>From the speeches that have already been given, it is quite clear that that is correct. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> (iii) a successful export incentive for small and medium sized enterprises;</PARA>
<PARA>Those three propositions are all propositions that I would think nobody would have any difficulty with and should pass. The amendment then goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) expresses grave concern at the Government's mooted abolition of the scheme which would be: <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> (i) a cynical and blatant breach of an express election commitment to retain and expand the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA>I can imagine that the government may have some difficulty with the language of that part of the amendment, but if there have been these assurances given by ministers in the now government in the past, then the expression of a disappointment that that election promise is to be broken is a reasonable proposition. The amendment goes on:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> (ii) counter to any reasonable assessment of the evidence given to the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee in the course of the committee's consideration of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA>That seems to be a proposition that is undeniable, but the evidence given to the committee, from the way I have read it in any event, would certainly support the proposition put forward by Senator Evans for Senator Cook. The third part of the amendment says:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) condemns the Government for its failure to meet its election commitment to extend the EMDG scheme by making full Export Market Development Grants of 50% available to the tourism industry.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, the language is such that the government may have  considerable problems about supporting it. The general proposition contained in the amendment is that this is a good scheme that was guaranteed, while the present government was in opposition, to continue, and that it does produce, for the outlays that are made, a great return. If I remember rightly, and Senator Cook might be able to help me, the committee reported that the multiplier for the return for the outlay was something like 15 to 25 times. Senator Cook has acknowledged that that is correct. It would seem, simply by that proposition, to be a foolish thing to take away a scheme that has a multiplier such as that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a scheme that clearly should continue, and the legislation should continue. It is interesting that the government has chosen to continue this scheme by introducing this legislation. The one thing missing is a guarantee that the scheme will continue into the future. For the sake of the commercial health of these exporters that rely upon the scheme, a clear message should be given that the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1782"> scheme will continue. That is the very best thing that could happen. But if it is not to continue, they should be given as much notice as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The best thing the government can do is guarantee that the scheme will continue. The second best thing the government can do is that, if they are going to stop the scheme, they should tell these commercial and industrial people now that it is going to discontinue. The worst thing that could happen is for them to be left uncertain, which is what the government is presently doing.</PARA></SPEECH>

Since the measure was actually announced at the last budget in May 1995 by the then government, and introduced in November of that year, we feel the industry should have had enough time to understand that reductions were under way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an issue of potential retrospectivity that was raised. The issue concerns what to do about businesses that knew the grants were to be cut but then, when the bill was not passed before the election, planned for higher grant levels on the assumption that the bill either would not be passed or would apply from the next year only. I can understand that people may have got themselves into trouble in relation to that, but I think they were certainly taking a bit of risk and skating near the edge if they made business&hyphen;critical decisions on that basis&mdash;in the face of the budget announcement and the introduction of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> It is an issue of concern, but I will say that I am not really inclined to support the notion that businesses taking risks on legislation failing to pass should have legislation chan ged for their protection and benefit. I will note that any business which was facing the same legislative scenario and which behaved as if the legislation would pass would be disadvantaged relative to the risk&hyphen;takers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second issue is the grants entry test. This is also of concern to me. The committee report, in relation to what the test is seen as, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">undermining the open access principle of the scheme by imposing on first time claimants threshold criteria. It was also seen as being contrary to the non&hyphen;discretionary nature of the scheme . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I do think that this is a way of reducing expenditure, in spite of Austrade's denial. This was confirmed in my mind by the fact that, when we were given a briefing, this was introduced as a way of ensuring that money is not wasted. We do not support waste, but I believe that measures to reduce expenditure&mdash;which this is&mdash;should be clearly explained as such.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Evidence has focused on the fact that a percentage of the businesses which get export market development grants subsequently fail. The obvious aim of this measure is to reduce such situations by pre&hyphen;assessment. With the grants going down and being more discretionary, perhaps the minister will clarify whether this means there will be more grants available to more businesses, especially the service industries which have had more difficulty, particularly finance difficulties, getting assistance because of the nature of their business. Perhaps we could get some clarification from the minister on that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1783"> The idea of pre&hyphen;assessment is a vexatious one. Once you enter it, it does eliminate the open access principle, although the access might still be generally available. Discretion involves an assessment rather than a simple criterion, such as has been applied in this program to date. The problem is that, even with the best will in the world, once you get people deciding whether a business is a good one you get into either picking winners or excluding losers and you are in trouble, you are off into the subjective decisions of some panel. Pretty quickly, you are liable to reach a state where some disgruntled applicants take you to court or a tribunal and get you in volved in litigation. You are also a target of claims of favouritism and improper action, no matter how scrupulous you try to be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How do service industries then prove their viability? That is a difficulty that goes on and on. If you are providing a consultative service for export overseas, then the difficulty is that you bring the team together. What do you look at when you are looking at the viability of that kind of proposal?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Should it be assessed project by project? That is an important issue. Often a company will build into their total plan the fact that they rely on such government assistance to get a first proposal under way, on the basis that it gives them experience, something to put in their CV. Project by project, it might not actually be bringing in a profit. If you base it on a project by project basis, how do you then check with the company whether or not that is part of their overall plan and whether it will be of benefit to their general business if they proceed in that particular manner?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also a tendency, no matter how discretionary schemes start, for a more and more discretionary approach to be adopted. Often those who are charged with making judgements are themselves assessed in terms of outcomes, so they become more and more conservative. What I am highlighting here is that once you make something discretionary, no matter what your intention, you get on a slippery slope.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am satisfied that the intention is reasonable, but I question the eventual outcome. I would say that it is problematic, but I would prefer to see some hard criteria which can be used as existing criteria are. We would prefer to see you take a little more time and develop such defined criteria so that you can maintain the open access aspects of the scheme while meeting your concerns. Perhaps this could be dealt with by some guidelines in relation to the discretionary criteria, and that would make it fairer all round. Perhaps the minister would like to help us out with whether or not there are guidelines to be written in so that people clearly know the basis on which this assessment will take place.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill and to support the amendment moved by my colleague Senator Chris Evans on behalf of Senator Cook. As Senator Cook indicated in his remarks, we support the bill itself, but with this second reading amendment which clearly states our support for the EMDG scheme. As outlined in the amendment, we believe that it is necessary to state now in the Senate why this EMDG scheme should be continued, despite the dreadful speculation now coming from government sources that this scheme may be abolished by the ideologically driven right&hyphen;wing agenda of the new government to cut expenditure in a blind way, without any thought to the consequences.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As minister for small business in the previous government, and before that chairman of the foreign affairs, defence and trade committee of the Australian Parliament, I have seen the advantages to Australia of both the export market development grants scheme and the DIFF scheme, which has already been announced as being abolished by the government. Both of these schemes are very important to the economic future of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it incomprehensible that there could be members of the new government sitting around the ERC table saying that we can get a short-term saving of a couple of hundred million dollars by abolishing the export market development grants scheme. They do not understand that evidence now before the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee covering this area says that the multiplier effect of EMDG is at least 10 to one and may be up to 25 to one. This means that, for every dollar that we put into that $200 million, we can get back hundreds of millions of dollars more. Mr Oliver from Austrade, before the Senate legislation committee of 5 June, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The multiplier found by Professor Bewley, who headed that evaluation, showed that across the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1784"> scheme, if you considered all claimants, it is 10 to one additional exports. So last year just a touch under $200 million was paid out under the scheme. That in turn generated $2 billion worth of incremental exports. That is the assumption. If you look at claimants that are what we call `experienced' in the scheme&mdash;and they would be claimants from year three onwards and have some export experience&mdash;the multiplier is up to 25 to one, depending upon the industry and the number of years that the company has been in the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the scheme the government is considering abolishing to save $200 million, which will cost us $2 billion in fewer exports. That means the current account deficit goes out by $2 billion to save $200 million on a short&hyphen;term basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do have economic vandals loose in the ERC and in this new government. That is the best way you could describe them because vandals apparently do know what they are doing occasionally&mdash;that is, they deliberately go out to wreck something. It may be that we just have a bunch of dills in this new government who do not understand what they are about and do not understand the consequences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we were in government we were lectured by the then opposition that we did not understand the importance of reducing the current account deficit. To now have this new government speculating that it wants to get rid of the export market development grants scheme to save $200 million, even though it will add at least a $2 billion deficit on the current account deficit, is extraordinary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> It is probably not surprising that this is starting to occur in this government as its honeymoon is rapidly coming to an end. When you have ministers of the calibre of Mr Downer, Mr Fischer and Mr Moore responsible for administering these schemes in the foreign affairs area, the trade area and the industry area and for explaining them to their cabinet colleagues, who may not be as fully aware of the ins and outs of this particular scheme, you would think they would understand their importance. Information would be available to them from their departments, from Austrade itself, which I have just quoted, from the Department of Industry, Science and Tourism, from the foreign affairs depart ment and its trade people as well as, overwhelmingly, from business. Yet that seems to have all disappeared, and the decision to abolish DIFF is a start.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> there is an article by Mr Sheridan which really makes the case of the stupidity of this new government in abolishing the development import financing facility, commonly known as the DIFF scheme. He says that decision:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . represents a triumphant combination of mad left and mad right dogma.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what he says about getting rid of the DIFF scheme. Yes, there are a few people in the aid area who would like the DIFF money spent on direct foreign aid. If they are successful in getting rid of the DIFF scheme, does anyone believe that that money would be transferred under this government across to direct foreign aid? Of course not. It will be taken as a saving and spent somewhere else; it will not be transferred across to direct aid in the aid budget, administered by AusAID, and made available to many of the excellent NGOs who have overseas aid programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been approached by some of those organisations and I pointed out that fact to them. It is all very well to argue philosophically that DIFF money should be in the direct aid budget and should not be counted as direct aid but they are giving succour to this government's ideologically driven agenda to reduce aid full stop. The saving in DIFF will not be flowing across to an increase in direct aid; it will go somewhere else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The article by Mr Sheridan goes on to point out that in the DIFF area, as I have just pointed out, in the export market development grants area, according to an assessment by AusAID, `. . . each dollar of DIFF generates $5 of export income. Thus, to save $100 million, we are going to destroy $500 million in export income.' As Mr Sheridan says: `This is truly stupid.' I think we have a stupid foreign affairs minister.</PARA>

It is only just starting to come out in articles, such as Mr Sheridan's article today. There was an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  on 15 June and an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>  on 14 June. Mr Downer, in speaking to a major foreign affairs forum in America about 10 days ago, attended by other representatives of the Australian parliament both from the government and the opposition, started off his speech by telling Catholic jokes. The journalist who wrote this article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> , Mr Stutchbury, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Why on earth would he publicly "confess" to Georgetown president, the Rev. Leo O'Donovon, that his Canberra press secretary was once a Jesuit priest but was now "happily married though"? And why would he make a point of revealing that his own seat contained a smaller proportion of Catholics than any other of Australia's 148 federal electorates?</PARA>
<PARA>This is the representative of Australia at large in America, one of our closest allies, making stupid comments. It is at the level of Mr Downer's performance of the `things that batter', the thing that cost him the leadership of the Liberal Party. He is at it again but this time he is disgracing Australia overseas. This is the man whom we expect to understand why it is important to maintain the DIFF scheme and the export market development scheme. Yet all he can do when he is overseas representing this country is make himself out to be an embarrassing fool by telling anti-Catholic jokes at a Jesuit college.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we all understand that Mr Downer's humour has never grown up since high school, and that is what cost him the leadership of the Liberal Party. Therefore, I think it should be put on notice that, if this sort of performance continues, Mr Howard will have to ask him to step down as foreign minister. We cannot put up with this sort of embarrassing performance overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same article mentions Mr Fischer turning up at a meeting with the equivalent US secretary and putting his Akubra hat on the desk, which went down like an indication that we are country bumpkins. It certainly did not impress the Americans. You might say <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that this is our culture, but I do not think it is.

What would happen if officials from his department had to explain to another official in a foreign affairs department what that meant? If that appeared in a memo or a cable and people had to go out and talk it up because it was what our trade minister said, there would be mass confusion. Nobody can understand that gobbledegook.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Downer and Mr Fischer are being let loose to do great damage to Australia's reputation. The articles appearing in the press point that out.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it staggering that a coalition which claims to understand business better than the Labor Party, the Greens, the Australian Democrats or anyone else, which claims to have a closer organic relationship with the business community, is blithely making these changes despite the fact that every Australian exporting business is asking them, `Do you understand what you are doing?' But they just proceed in the way they are going because they are ideologically driven and, more importantly, they do not have the ability to assess the outcome that is best for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Sheridan, in his article, also puts his view about Treasury's assessment of the DIFF scheme. I think he makes some very good <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1786"> points about Treasury. If Mr Costello always accepts Treasury's views we will end up doing nothing because Treasury will not spend a cent. In relation to the DIFF scheme, Treasury itself said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is highly unlikely that the DIFF&hyphen;related resources would otherwise be idle.</PARA>
<PARA>And further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the DIFF program could cause some misallocation of resources.</PARA>
<PARA>As a former minister, I argued against that Treasury view, as did my colleague Senator Cook as a former industry minister, and as did many others. When Treasury was selling us that line, its own dry economic line, we worked out that it was not necessarily in the interests of Australia. This is not about getting the budget deficit down and fiscal rectitude, things which we support. This is the difference between the madness of wiping out export industries and promoting them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we take the Treasury line to its ultimate conclusion, in 1787 when the First Fleet was about to set out to establish European settlement, Treasury would have said that it was not a cost benefit plus for Australia or Great Britain. It would have said that it was a misallocation of resources. That is the Treasury line all the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On this side of politics, we make no bones about the fact that government should intervene in the marketplace from time to time to reallocate resources in order to get a better outcome for society. That is not what Treasury believes. The monoculture of economists in Treasury have a different view.</PARA>

The more absurd assertion coming from Treasury is that we should be the first ones to make an example by getting rid of DIFF; then, hopefully, our competitors will get rid of their equivalent schemes. That is the naivety of Treasury's argument against DIFF schemes <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and export market development grants schemes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to you, the new government, that if you continue to allow the Treasury view to continue, you will be a one&hyphen;term government.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today we have speculation about the end of the export market development grants scheme coming on top of the DIFF scheme. If the maddies in the Liberal Party fall for that, if that is in the budget, there will be a great couple of weeks here when we read back what government senators when in opposition said about these schemes and how we as the then government were not doing enough. You will have to sit there and cop it and explain why you have done a double back somersault and why all these schemes which you said were good when you were in opposition are now going under.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The line about the $8 billion deficit will not wash, and you know it. All you will accomplish by knocking over these schemes is a reduction of the economy, a reduction of our export potential. Mr Moore might have been an excellent stockbroker but I do not think that he has much of an idea about industry. Mr Downer might have been an excellent member of the Adelaide establishment and an excellent lawyer working for the chamber of commerce, and Mr Fischer might have been an excellent farmer, but they have failed to go the next step, to be ministers who understand how industry works in this country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier in this debate Senator Chris Evans moved an amendment to the second reading and I wish to take a few minutes to address that amended motion. The motion is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1787"> in three parts and expresses, if carried, that the Senate:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) is of the opinion that the EMDG scheme is:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i) a successful scheme which enhances Australia's export performance,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii) a source of job creation and benefits Australia's balance of payments, and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iii) a successful export incentive for small and medium sized enterprises;. . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is the first part of this amended motion. I have already spoken to that and made a number of points, but perhaps I should reiterate them quickly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first point concerns the excellence of the EMDG scheme. As given in evidence to the Senate committee, this scheme creates a one to 10 advantage and for experienced exporters a one to 25 advantage. The evidence given came from Austrade and is based on calculations done during a review of the scheme overseen by Treasury and Finance which was then reported. The calculations were done by Professor Ron Bewley who is the professor of econometrics at the University of New South Wales. We heard in evidence that, whilst the scheme currently ranks at approximately $200 million on the outlays side of the budget, it generates $2 billion in exports, according to the calculations done by this independent authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Any diminution of the scheme will reduce the ability of Australian companies to compete in foreign markets and therefore earn less income for Australia. If the scheme is abolished, we will be cutting off our noses to spite our faces, because we will make a saving of about $122 million&mdash;and I will explain that calculation in a minute&mdash;for an outlay of $200 million. But we will be losing $2 billion worth of income to the nation because of the exports generated by this scheme. That is a classic case of cutting off your nose to spite your face and that is why the opposition wants this stake put in the ground now. We want Australia to understand that, if this government moves to abolish this scheme as it is rumoured everywhere that it intends to, that will be a classic case of destroying Australia's international competitiveness and blunting the ability of Australian companies&mdash;in particular small to medium <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sized companies&mdash;to win export markets overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On average the multiplier is 10 to one. For experienced exporters it is 25 to one, according to the independent findings. That means that experienced exporters can make even more money out of this scheme for the nation. The Australian Information Industries Association&mdash;the body covering the manufacture of software, computer parts and computers&mdash;says that the multiplier is 30 to one for experienced representatives of their show. What more critical element of industry could there be than the enabling technology of information technology?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we say in this amendment that it is a successful scheme, we base that assertion on the clear and independent findings of a recent review of the scheme and what it means to the nation. If the scheme is then blunted, undermined or set aside as the rumours suggest, Australians will lose jobs, the current account deficit will blow out even further and small and medium sized companies in this country, which have taken the government's word at face value and gone into exports, will be undermined and undercut.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A report has come to me that on 4 June this year the estimates for Austrade came before the ERC. Of course the government has declined to verify this, but it is a programatic fact that it occurred on that date. Austrade was told by the ERC to find 24.3 per cent in savings, that is, a 24.3 per cent cut in its running costs. Austrade administers this scheme and it takes a lot of manpower in Austrade to do it effectively. It is what Austrade should do and Austrade exists to support Australian companies in overseas markets. If Austrade's running costs are cut by a quarter, by linear calculation one would assume that it will be a quarter less effective in administering the scheme. Austrade is an ingenious and administratively adept organisation, so it will not be as much as that, but there will be a significant impact on the ability of Austrade&mdash;the agency appointed to do this&mdash;to support Australian companies in the field in their export efforts. There will be job losses in Austrade as well.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1788">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the second part of this amendment to the motion we express grave concern about the mooted abolition of the scheme. The important thing to remember is that this is a consistent rumour. The bureaucracy leaks, industry knows about it and industry is up in arms. There is no other explanation for the number of industry organisations that came before the Senate committee of inquiry and gave evidence of their concerns about the abolition of this scheme. All of them put a stake in the ground and said that this scheme should stay. All of them said in unanimous harmony that, if the government abolished this scheme, it would be a retrograde step. There is no clearer understanding of where industry stands on this than the actual words of industry itself and that has to be borne in mind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other significant fact is: what did industry believe was the government's mandate when it came to office? In order to assess what the mandate of this government is, one has to go to their election undertakings. On three occasions we know that this government, in the run-up to the election, made it abundantly clear to industry that this scheme would stay and, in fact, it would become better and bigger. That is not being complied with by this bill, and some industry organisations said that they believed this bill would not come forward because of the undertakings given in the pre-election period by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the scheme is to be removed, it flies in the face of a specific undertaking given by the Minister for Trade (Mr Fischer) at the National Press Club in February. It flies in the face of a specific undertaking in an election campaign document released by the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, Mr Moore, when setting out the government's proposals on this scheme. It flies directly in the face of private and personal assurances, which were reported to the Senate committee by industry associations, given in meetings between them and the Minister for Trade in his chambers prior to the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those reasons, this opposition will fight as hard as it can to ensure that the government is held to its election undertakings, that the expectations of industry are delivered on <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and that the government does not repudiate its public position. Of course, if the bean counters have their way and it is repudiated, the government must wear the responsibility for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third part of this motion that is before the chamber relates to a condemnation of the government for its failure to meet its election commitment to extend the EMDG scheme by making full market development grants of 50 per cent available to the tourism industry. I have in my notes&mdash;and I do not have sufficient time to go through all of them&mdash;copious copies of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> and a debate in this chamber on 20 June last year. This was a debate on the EMDG scheme. This was a debate which was led for the then opposition by Senator Warwick Parer, now a minister in this government, and he led in his capacity at that time as the shadow minister for tourism. He sought to amend the bill to increase the payments to the tourist industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might say that he made an excellent case. It is good reading. He made an excellent case about the importance of the tourist industry to Australia: why it is an area of major growth, why it is an area of major income, and why it is so important and significant to the current account deficit. The growth in tourism in Australia over the last several years&mdash;the years of the Labor government&mdash;is a story in itself, but it is a dramatic story; it is a story about an inexorably upward moving graph and about increasing the income earned to this nation and to tourist operators because of more and more tourists flocking to our shores.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Parer then sought to increase in the bill at that time, 20 June, advantages to the tourist industry, which the government at that time rejected. But in the election undertakings these undertakings were underpinned again. My question really is: can the tourist industry trust this government? This is the first opportunity this government has to deliver on those promises to the tourist industry, and they are not in this bill. They have not delivered on them, and they have not shown the slightest inclination to do so. Therefore, when can the tourist industry expect that this government will own up to its electoral undertakings and deliver on those promises?</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1789">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a precedent for this. This bill that we have before the chamber now is substantially, but not entirely, the same as a bill that was produced by the former government and was introduced for debate in November of last year. While it is not entirely the same, it is substantially the same, and one does not take exception to the differences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a precedent for this government to introduce a bill of the former government but attach to it an advantage to a special interest group because it believes it is appropriate. That was the customs excise bill relating to the diesel fuel rebate scheme, where the announcements of the previous government in the 1995-96 budget gave rise to a bill to modify the scheme to cut out unfair claims upon the scheme so the scheme met its original direction. That bill came up here, but it came up here with an extra clause attached to provide a particular advantage to farmers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not criticise the farming community for that. Obviously the government had promised them that at the fist opportunity they would insert into the diesel fuel rebate scheme a provision that provided additional advantage beyond the advantages that were there, and the government may have been wanting then to deliver on an undertaking that it made. But why does it draw a distinction? Why is it all right for farmers when it is not all right, in the case of the tourist industry, to do what the government promised the industry it would do at the first opportunity when it introduced this bill? Why does the government regard this industry, which has been the star performer in Australian industry over the last decade, as a second-class citizen to the farming community when it comes to delivering on promises? As a consequence, we have a provision in this motion which, if carried, will condemn the government for its failure to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I conclude, there is another quite significant fact that ought to be said in support of this motion as well. One of the key election promises of the government was to reduce the level of compliance costs by small business, to reduce the amount of red tape that small business had to deal with when seeking government assistance or conforming to government requirements at the law. The <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government has climbed on high and with a flourish of bugles announced that it has set up a committee that will examine this. We wait with baited breath to see what the findings of this committee will be if and when it actually returns a finding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know already that there has been some backtracking by the government, because the minister responsible for small business has tried now to soft pedal on the amount of red tape that will, in fact, be cut. The small business summit last week turned out to be an absolute fizzer as no real changes were made but, nonetheless, the matter is under study. We will continue to follow that debate and see what the study produces. This bill introduces the complexity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had the opportunity&mdash;which I acknowledge was extended to me by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade, Senator Brownhill, because of my concerns about the administrative complexity that this bill will add to small business&mdash;to be shown by Austrade a pro forma document which Austrade is consulting industry about so as to finalise their position on the regulations for the execution of the provisions in this bill, should it be proclaimed. That document produces a form that requires businesses to fill out 10 pages of quite detailed material on their performance, the nature of their accounts, the market they expect, the competitors they expect to meet in that market and a number of other things&mdash;10 pages of considerable detail in order to comply with the requirements of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think Austrade is an excellent organisation and I wish it well in reducing those 10 pages to one or two pages. I hope they succeed. My cynical nature suggests that they have the task ahead of them but I wish them well in their endeavours. The point is that the 10&hyphen;page, detailed proposal that small business needs to fill out in order to comply with the requirements to access this scheme is a huge paper burden. The election promise of the government to reduce compliance costs by 50 per cent has taken a smashing blow because, while the government is saying to small business on the one hand that it wants to reduce those compliance costs, on the other <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1790"> hand it is increasing the amount of red tape by virtue of this provision. It is not just increasing it a bit; it is increasing it dramatically.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee looking at the red tape issue for the government start not from scratch but from behind scratch in the amount of work that they have to do. As I say, I wish Austrade well and I wish the committee reviewing the red tape well. I hope they succeed. My cynical nature tends to think that they will not and that the government's election promise was an empty rhetorical promise, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. It will be seen through on the first couple of occasions that small business run up against this sort of legislation. I know it outrages many people in small business who are feeling used and duped by this type of rhetoric from the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by saying that this is a bill of some importance to the opposition and, I know from their contributions, to the minor parties. On current performance, this scheme generates $2 billion worth of exports for Australia. That is an independently and arms&hyphen;length refereed figure, not one plucked out of the air by me. This bill provides an opportunity for industry in Australia to put a stake clearly in the ground saying that this scheme&mdash;a $2 billion advantage to this nation&mdash;should continue and that the government, which promised to continue the scheme, should be held to that promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bean counters in Treasury and Finance have been after this scheme for a long time&mdash;I saw the submissions coming forward during the former government. They do not like this scheme. If they succeed in overwhelming the industry minister, the trade minister and the others who have a vested advantage in defending this scheme, then we in the opposition will fight them. It will be a tooth and nail, down to the wire fight. The government will not be let off the hook. That is a firm promise from me. I have great pleasure in supporting the motion moved by Senator Chris Evans and I trust that the Senate will see the wisdom of it and carry it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">MINISTER DOWNER: Thanks very much, Jeff, and Father O'Donovan, Your Excellency, the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australian Ambassador and Ladies and Gentleman. Thank you very much for your introduction, Jeff. I am certainly delighted to be here in this world&hyphen;famous and truly great Jesuit institution. I have to confess two things. One of them is that my press secretary who is back in Australia at the moment was himself a Jesuit priest but is not anymore.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And another thing is, and this is another rather unfortunate coincidence, that if you take the 148 electoral districts of Australia, mine has the smallest proportion of people of the Roman Catholic denomination. That is, of course, a characteristic of South Australia which is very much dominated by people from the Church of England and what used to be the Methodist Church and is now the Uniting Church.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But I am not here to talk about religion. I am here to talk about the Australia and New Zealand Studies Centre which, I think, is a truly excellent initiative and we as Australians are delighted to see this centre of study established and to provide the support we do provide for it. And Georgetown University, as I mentioned already, is one of the really great universities of the world, not just of the United Stated. It has many distinguished alumni including, of course, the President. For us to have this Studies Centre at Georgetown, I think, is something very advantageous to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Obviously, it is a centre that provides educational ties with Australia and helps Americans understand Australia better than might otherwise be the case. But more deeply than that, I think it is a great opportunity for us as Australians to help to get our message across better in the United States and develop an understanding&mdash;a better understanding&mdash;of Australia in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is often said that Australians and Americans have a great deal in common and we share common values and so on. But one of the things we really do share is that as societies we have rather similar but not identical origins. That is, we were countries which had a fairly small indigenous population but with very rich cultures. That Europeans came and settled those societies and totally changed those societies and those societies have subsequently evolved from that point. And indeed, one of the interesting things which is worth exploring is the way the society in the United States has differed somewhat in its evolution from society in Australia. Not, I suspect, as many would easily argue because of slightly different, in fact quite different, migration patterns but because of the different values that the early settlers of those two societies had. And I often argue that it is the values of the early European settlers in a so&hyphen;called "New World" that very much entrenched for the long&hyphen;term the fundamental values of those societies. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1792"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So, although Australia and United States have a great deal in common there are some quite subtle differences in the values of our societies&mdash;in their value systems. And if you go back and look at the early history of the European settlers in those societies, the differences in those people in Australia and the United States helps to explain the differences in those values. So, I think this would be very much something that could be explored in this Centre. It is a thesis that, as you can see, I am getting excited about (Laughter) A thesis that I am personally quite interested in and one that can be extended to Latin American and to examine why Latin American societies are so different today from societies like the United States and Australia and New Zealand and Canada. So, it is quite an interesting issue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These sorts of issues are things we need to have a better understanding of. I also have to say that I think the stereotypical view of Australia which exists in the United States as it does in parts of Europe, or probably most of Europe, is a view of Australia that is, I suppose, reasonably flattering but is an unsophisticated view of a society which is, in fact, a very interesting and sophisticated and successful society.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I like ministers who go out and sell their country and as far as I am concerned, I think Australia is one of the true success stories of human civilisation. As a society it has worked incredibly well. It is a multicultural society with people from 120 or 130 countries settling Australia but they live in relative harmony and they live with a great deal of tolerance of different cultures, different religions, different denominations and even of rather different values. It is a country which has developed, as has the United States, a high standard of living and generally speaking, I think, as a country which you could describe as essentially a very decent country. Australia is a country which has very decent values and I think internationally makes a contribution to the world which underlies the essential decency of Australian society.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So, we are absolutely delighted that apart from the perspective of Australia that somehow is a place with kangaroos, where people play a lot of sport and beat Americans at the Olympic Games, particularly at things like swimming, those truly important exercises. And in tennis, we used to beat the United States at tennis once. That takes you back. That takes you back a long time . . . (Laughter) . . . when we used to beat them in the Davis Cup. But that Australia is so much more than that and is such a rich and exciting country. I suppose there is one other thing I should mention before I finish about Australia that I think is simply not understood in other parts of the world. And that is that of all the countries that I have ever visited&mdash;and I am biased about this as the Australian Foreign Minister&mdash;of all the countries I have ever visited, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> I think Australia is one of the countries that has the strongest contribution and the strongest commitment to the Arts. That is an aspect of Australian society which is little understood and little known. But the performing arts and the creative arts generally in Australia are very rich and very strongly supported by the Australian people. I doubt, as a proportion of the population you would get more support for the Arts in terms of consumers in any country than you get in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So, there is much about Australia which I think is misunderstood. There is much about Australia which is not understood at all. And we as Australians are very proud of what we have achieved over the last 200 or so years and we would like to go out and tell our story and sell our story more positively and aggressively than we have done in the past. I guess we are sort of shy and modest . . . (Laughter) . . . people but I don't think we have anything to be modest about. I don't think we should be that. I think we should be quite outspoken and positive about our really great country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I said, we are absolutely delighted with this Studies Centre and I am very happy that the Australian Government has decided to present some books to the Centre. I had a look on the way here in the car at the books that we are actually presenting, or at least a selection of them, and I know that I have symbolically to present you, Father with one of those books. I have decided to present a different one from the one that I was originally asked to present cause I didn't like that one. (Laughter) So, I thought that Geoffrey Serle biography of John Monash who is not only a great engineer but he is remembered particularly as a great general during the First World War would be a more appropriate book to present you with than the one that I won't name. But before I do that I also want to acknowledge Henry Nowik who is here with us today if I can see him out the back there. Henry has himself presented&mdash;as I understand it&mdash;presented the centre with some first editions of Patrick White's novels. And Patrick White is Australia's Nobel Prize winning novelist and a wonderful and particularly interesting writer. So, I would like to acknowledge what Henry has done. We are very appreciative of that contribution as well.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So Father, it is with those few words it is the greatest of pleasure that I make the presentation to you and symbolically pass you this biography of John Monash.</PARA>

Third, it extends tax deductibility for gifts to a wider range of organisations. The Democrats will be supporting this bill and we will be supporting the amendment that will be proposed by the opposition later in the committee stage&mdash;an amendment which applies to the provisional tax uplift factor.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This morning Senator Short made a clarifying statement about answers yesterday in question time. The issue related to legislation by press release and the particular component that was in question here was the requirement for Treasury to advertise the starting date of this within seven days. There is another matter which is relevant in this bill. I think you can argue that the share buyback provisions are in technical breach of the Senate resolution of 8 November 1988. This resolution, too, deals with legislation by press release and it requires that legislation by press release be introduced into the parliament within six months to preserve the operative date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is related. We are not going to say we are not going to vote for the bill because technically it is in breach. You can argue that this provision was included in the bill introduced by the previous government in November last year. It was just outside the six&hyphen;month rule. The bill lapsed. This bill brings it back again. We will not be opposing it, but we are very conscious of the fact that legislation by press release, particularly on tax matters, was abused very much in past years.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate sought to redress that, and we want to give notice that we are going to insist in future on the 1988 resolution. We want it to be rigorously enforced. We do not want a return to the days of a Treasurer's abuse of legislation by press release.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On to the provisional tax uplift factor: this is the third time we have debated this in recent years, mostly because the Democrats have put it on the agenda. In 1984 we moved to reduce the uplift factor from eight per cent to five per cent. Despite a number of very passionate speeches from coalition senators including, I recall, Senators Short and Boswell&mdash;they condemned the eight per cent figure as too high&mdash;they went on to vote with the government at the time to keep it at eight per cent. I remember the wonderful reasons given. I will remember them till I leave this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First of all, they said, `It costs too much to the budget,' even though it was revenue neutral over two years. Then they said, `Well, if they don't believe that, it really constitutes blocking supply,' which was nonsense as well. Then they came back with, `We have talked to small business and they don't really want it yet. They can wait. They can wait till we come into government.' Well, they have waited.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition is in government. The bill has been brought forward and the Democrats welcome the fact that the politics of the situation, not the merit, now means that the issue will be addressed after three years of small business groups such as COSBOA describing this issue&mdash;the provisional tax uplift factor&mdash;as one of the biggest issues facing the small business sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The result of this bill will be the reduction of taxes collected from small business next financial year by $180 million. This is a tax which the previous government continued to collect on income which small businesses had not in fact earned. The impact of the $180 million impost on small business cash flows, on employment, on tax compliance costs and so on, as the Senate committee found, has been very significant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that this impost should have been removed years ago. We are disappointed <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1794"> that that was not able to happen. Small business has been extremely disappointed at the behaviour of the previous coalition in opposition, too. But it was a coalition election commitment. It was one of 23 proposals which we put to this new government some time ago. As a sign of good faith, we said, `Here are 23 issues with which we agree in your policy commitments. We are prepared to support them. You could have one piece of legislation passed through the Senate a day.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, no. This is the only issue they have brought forward to this date. They have, as some commentators have referred to, stuck to a self-imposed virility test by focusing on Telstra and industrial relations&mdash;issues they knew the Senate was always going to take issue with. I add that this government, even with this bill, has failed to live up to the commitment it gave to small business in the election campaign because this bill is only for one year. At the end of 1996-97, the uplift factor will revert to 10 per cent. We will have this debate all over again.</PARA>

<TIME.STAMP>(12.45 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this matter of public interest debate today to raise an issue of great importance to post-secondary education in Australia; that is, the development of learning pathways&mdash;allowing students access to post-secondary education across all its various levels, from learning centres right through to universities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the former Labor government's rhetoric in this area, learning pathways in Australia have not yet evolved to very sophisticated levels. Many of the current structures between the different types of education providers do not mesh properly. Moving between different levels of post-secondary  education is very difficult for many students and many of the pathways that are supposed to exist remain very poorly connected. This lack of proper meshing is a major frustration <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> because it wastes the time of students in repeating courses unnecessarily. It also wastes very scarce institutional resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a senator, I have had quite a number of people come to me who have had such pathway problems. One that stands out in my mind particularly is an accountancy student who had completed four years part time of a diploma in accounting at TAFE. That is the equivalent of two years full-time study. When he approached the nearby university to transfer to a degree course in accountancy, he was granted six months out of the two years equivalent. In other words, he was only given a quarter and more or less had to go back almost to scratch. This is despite having spent four years studying part time. Those sorts of examples are rife through the system and bring on this need to create smoother pathways from one section to another and to remove the many barriers to articulation that exist in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been in recent times some welcome moves on this front. The ministerial council for employment, education, training and youth affairs set up the Australian qualification framework. I emphasise at this stage that what I am about to describe is not in place; it is a plan. It is an objective to get such pathways in place. They are aiming to make national qualifications much more consistent and, particularly in the developing international market for Australian educational services, to make them better understood internationally. They take into account key competency, structure and content, and changes in the vocational education and training courses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This framework was endorsed by all ministers, state and federal, when it was put to the council. The Australian qualification framework aims to link and mesh our educational sectors to emphasise key competency qualifications and to emphasise skill and knowledge in terms of the levels people are at, not the length of the course. Senior secondary qualifications link in to the vocational education and training level under this scheme and those courses in turn link in to higher education courses. The framework is a very good guide to course developers and it is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1795"> excellent for an understandable system of qualification registration. We only hope&mdash;I will certainly be urging for this to occur&mdash;the new government will implement this framework as quickly as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned that the framework is in the planning stage and not in force across the country. However, there are a number of bright spots that I want to mention briefly where such articulation in the system, such credit transfer, such pathways, already exist in a few isolated spots. They are in my own area of northern New South Wales, so I would like to mention two of them just briefly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first is at the Ourimbah campus of the University of Newcastle. Ourimbah, for those who do not know their geography, is just outside of Gosford on the central coast of New South Wales. The University of Newcastle and the Hunter Institute of Technology, which run the TAFE program, have developed a joint development at the Ourimbah campus. They have a single management structure where the vice-chancellor of the University of Newcastle and the director of the Hunter Institute of Technology have devolved responsibility to develop integrated courses and pathways between TAFE and university courses at that site to the director of the central coast campus. They took in their first 50 students in 1989.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was a member of the committee that was involved in the establishment of that university campus. Now, seven years later, what has developed on this site is absolutely amazing&mdash;in terms of facilities, in terms of the programming and in terms of the staffing. Enrolments after 1989 doubled each year and currently there are 3,000 tertiary students on that site, two-thirds of them enrolled in higher education courses with the rest studying vocational education and training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The campus operates as a single integrated unit. The original plan was to have TAFE up one end and the university down the other end and to have common sports fields, union and library facilities, but they have gone much further than that. You can walk along a corridor and have a TAFE class in one room and a university class in the next one. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Staff are all in the same area as well, and it operates as an integrated unit with a very strong emphasis on collaboration across the two sectors. This has assisted potential and continuing students with course choices, articulation of their program and credit transfer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A federal government working party has now been established to inquire into the further development of this site as a central coast university of technology. The minister has approved a working party to investigate the further development of this concept, which would use not only the Ourimbah site that I have been talking about but also the Gosford and Wyong sites of TAFE, to operate a range of TAFE courses and university courses across all three sites.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a very definite need for this in the central coast area. People might not realise it, but that central coast region, Wyong, now has a quarter of a million people. Just to the north is Greater Newcastle, with a third of a million people, and just to the south is northern Sydney, in very close proximity to this campus and with one million people. So it is at the centre of a hub which is well connected by train lines and roads and which will, with this very imaginative approach to post&hyphen;secondary education, do extremely well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A second example of this sort of articulation and excellent credit transfer in the system is further north at the University of the Southern Cross, which is located mainly in Lismore with a number of satellite campuses. They have School of Business courses ranging from the certificate level through to PhD. A lot of these courses are tailor&hyphen;made to industry needs. They have worked, in particular, with leading companies such as Coles Myer and, in the public arena, Telstra to develop courses where people can plug in at these various levels and move up to further levels from certificate through to PhD. The two examples I have given are models which show how learning pathways can be properly connected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, despite the value of credit transfer, such bright spots as I have mentioned are fairly rare. We have a very poor history in this country on this whole issue of credit transfer which contrasts with countries like <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1796"> the United States, which are much more generous in their credit transfer arrangements. In the three sabbaticals I have done in the United States I noted, in particular, how generous they were in acknowledging properly the work that people had done in some other way before they came to an institution and giving them due credit for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia reached its low point on this matter probably in the 1950s, when the University of New England broke off from the University of Sydney and the University of Sydney would not recognise the University of New England undergraduate qualifications for post&hyphen;graduate work. Fortunately, we have got past that. In the 1960s my sister-in-law did eight&hyphen;ninths of a degree at the University of New South Wales. When my brother, her husband, went to New Guinea she enrolled externally through the University of Queensland and they granted her four-ninths of a degree. She had eight-ninths and she had to go back to four-ninths. That is incredibly wasteful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How are things in the 1990s? They are not much better. One of my daughters is doing a Bachelor of Business at the University of Newcastle. Her husband moved to Sydney with his job. She went to Sydney and enrolled at UTS. She had 50 per cent of a Bachelor of Business. They said: `We will give you 30 per cent.' She managed to haggle that up to 40 per cent. Credit transfer in 1996 is still a major problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The credit transfer agency that I referred to earlier hopefully will overcome some of these problems, but unfortunately that agency, with such high and lofty aims, has two people on staff. It is overworked and grossly understaffed. It is a pity, because it is a false economy. If you look at what happens across the whole system, you will find that it is very wasteful for students to repeat work they have already done. It takes up staffing time, it takes up library time, it takes up teaching time, it takes up institutional space.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will argue that the new government should give a much higher priority than the last government did to this whole credit transfer business, not only because of the obvious economies to the government in such an <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> arrangement, delivering programs much more efficiently and effectively, but also because of the much smoother pathway that it creates for training in our community for individuals, many of whom have been disadvantaged, to achieve their full potential.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<TITLE>Aborigines: Traditional Land Owners</TITLE>

<STATE> (New South Wales)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(12.58 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter of public interest that I wish to rise upon concerns a trip which I made last week to the Western Desert or, more correctly, to the Great Sandy Desert in Western Australia, and consultations which I had with the traditional owners of the land out there in two communities in particular&mdash;Parnngur and Punmu&mdash;in relation to their views on the mining industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By way of explanation, because I am a member of the uranium committee which has been set up by the Senate and because my time is very short, I decided that I wanted to visit the major potential sites for uranium mining within Australia. I had the good fortune to go to Roxby Downs or Olympic Dam with the caucus committee last year. So I went up to Kakadu and took my environment adviser with me, at my expense, to talk to the people there. Then last week, taking the opportunity of the break, I went out to the Great Sandy Desert to talk to the people around Kintyre, again taking my environment adviser with me at my expense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1797"> The reason I want to raise this matter with the Senate now is that I believe we need to be extraordinarily sensitive on the question of relations between traditional owners of the land and our white politics and their black politics. I am grateful to Senator West and Senator Mackay, who have given up their time today to allow me to speak on what I believe is a very sensitive issue. I will approach this whole matter with great trepidation, very much aware of the fact that the mismatch between white politics and black politics can lead to a great deal of abuse and unfairness in regard to the black population when it comes to representing their views. Nevertheless, I found that going to the West ern Desert was by far the most important thing that I have done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Northern Territory you have a different situation. Statute already allows for the views of the traditional owners to be taken into account. Through the Northern Land Council they are able to make their voice heard, and they have an important voice in whether mining goes ahead at Jabiluka or Koongarra. But in the Western Desert the situation is far more confused. I would like first to set the scene as far as the traditional owners are concerned. The Martu people were part of the groups of Aboriginal people who during the 1950s and 1960s were rounded up when they were children and moved on to missions. The missions had a sorry record through the 1950s and 1960s and then, moving into the 1980s and 1990s, they were disbanded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has happened with the Martu people is that they have gone back to the land&mdash;the traditional land of their forefathers&mdash;and have sought to set up their communities again. They have a great desire to see their children grow up on the land on which they were born and which they believe is rightfully theirs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the two communities that I went to&mdash;the first of which was the community of Parnngur, which is 1,200 kilometres north&hyphen;east of Perth and about 400 kilometres inland from Port Hedland&mdash;it is truly remarkable to see what these people have been able to achieve. In this regard, when people are talking about ATSIC and whatever deficiencies they might see in ATSIC, it is truly amazing to see what can be achieved by traditional owners&mdash;given a reasonable amount of funding&mdash;to re&hyphen;establish themselves on their land. I think the job that ATSIC has done in both of those two communities is truly remarkable. It is one of those things that really makes you proud to be an Australian and to see that there is some hope and some prospect of reconciliation in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular, I would like to thank Teddy Biljabu, who organised the meeting in Parnngur. He is a man of remarkable intelligence, remarkable experience and considerable dignity. He is a man who has the clear respect of the people whom he represents, and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a man who is keenly aware of the cultural identity of his people and has a very strong desire for that to continue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Punmu community&mdash;which I also visited, at Teddy's suggestion&mdash;I met a lady called Patricia Fry, whom I desperately wished worked as an organiser for the Labor Party. I think anyone would be proud to have this woman as an organiser. Her ability to round up people, get them off their behinds and get them to come to a meeting to express their views was truly remarkable to see. I came back with an enormous respect for her intelligence and her commitment to her own people. The other person I would like to particularly mention is a man who was introduced to me as `Longman': I think that was because he was the tallest person there. He also was a person of considerable dignity and was treated with considerable respect by his own people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first and most important thing that they had to say to me had nothing at all to do with uranium mining, but related to Mount Cotton, which is a hill which exists immediately behind the community of Parnngur. That is the most important thing to them, and anyone who goes to that community should rightfully reflect that. It is not the other issues that we are concerned with; it is the issue of Mount Cotton, for two reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First of all, Mount Cotton is a very sacred site for them, as far as the women are concerned, and has all sorts of importance associated with their cultural traditions. The second reason is that immediately behind it&mdash;as they took pains to show me&mdash;is their own burial ground, which has been there for many thousands of years and in which they all hope to be buried.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the subject of a mining lease by CRA. It has been drilled, in the past, for exploration. I hope that CRA and everyone else involved in that area leaves it alone from now on. There can be absolutely no doubt about the importance that the local people attach to that particular area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was mentioning before that ATSIC had done a great job in establishing these communities. I should also give credit to the teachers in the schools, particularly the teachers in the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1798"> schools at Parnngur&mdash;three people who are prepared to live in the middle of absolutely nowhere. There is very little there except a salt lake and sand dunes. But they work there, teaching the children of the community in the way that they wish to be taught. One of them happens to be a linguist who is teaching them to read and write in their own language.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a third community, called Gigalong. Senator Herron had been to visit that community about a week before I arrived. I think that Gigalong should be put in context with the other two communities. I do not know what point Senator Heron wants to make about his visit. He did mention it in question time yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to see that Gigalong was one of the original mission communities. There are three of these communities in a triangle&mdash;Gigalong being one, and Parnngur and Punmu being the other two. The latter two have been established in recent times, as people have taken the opportunity to go back to the land and re&hyphen;establish communities on the land on which they were born and which they all have vivid memories of being taken away from as children. Gigalong is one which is in decline, given its mission heritage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In all of this, there is a very complex and difficult legal situation. I was greatly aided by people who worked for the Western Desert Corporation Legal Centre&mdash;which is known locally as `Woodpac'&mdash;including, in particular, Grahame Powell and John Ford, who did a great deal to assist me in getting to the communities and organising the meetings. But at the present time, so far as I can establish, there is no direct legal ownership between the people there and the mine which is proposed by CRA at Kintyre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, Woodpac is in the process of putting in a land claim on behalf of those people which will be registered within days. The relationship between that land claim and the mining lease at Kintyre is going to become a very crucial one. But whatever else is said about it, the views of the people are very clear indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, I went there with a great deal of trepidation and I think, Madam Acting Deputy President, you, of all people, would recognise <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that there is this difficulty and sensitivity in dealing with black people and their politics and the mismatch, or potential mismatch, between their politics and white politics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But let me say that anyone who goes there is left with absolutely no doubt that the people within those two communities do not want uranium mining to go ahead. It is not a question of me or anybody else not being able to understand their politics, their views of expression, or anything else. They make it abundantly clear that it is something that they do not want. They do not want it because they do not understand it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would not suggest to the Senate that these people are as expert in the issues of uranium mining as I am, or others are, but they know that it is dangerous. They know that it threatens the things which they hold most dear: the water and the air. They do not believe that they know enough about it to be able to make a decision on what they know is a crucial question and for that reason, they do not want it to go ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important now because I know the pressure that the uranium companies are under at the moment. There is a narrow window of opportunity for new leases to be signed, given the cessation of supplies from the former Soviet Union. But it is a very short&hyphen;lived opportunity, and the pressure will come upon these people and on the government between now and the end of this year to have leases granted and deals signed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must impress upon the Senate that these people want much more time to understand the issue and to have all of these things taken into consideration before they have any idea of signing leases or giving their permission for mining to go ahead. It requires all people involved in this, particular the media, to be particularly sensitive to this situation. Nothing could be worse than a bunch of people going out to these communities with TV cameras, poking microphones into people's faces and saying, `Are you for or against this issue?' That would be the worst prostitution of the black political process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only way to do it is to do as I did: to sit down in the red dirt with these people and listen to their views. I must say that their <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1799"> views are very strong. As they said to me,`How many times do we have to tell you white fellas that we do not want this to go ahead.' They made it clear to me that they do not want the money. As I have said to you, ATSIC is providing sufficient funding for them to establish their communities and they certainly see no need for the money and they are not in the slightest bit interested in compensation. The land, as it exists at the present time, is infinitely more valuable to them than any amount of money that could be offered to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They do not want the jobs either because they do not see the jobs as meaningful. They have had an experience with jobs and mining before. As Teddy put it to me quite clearly: all of the white fellas get the good jobs in production where they can be trained and get transferable skills, and all of the blackfellas are put outside to dig holes, plant trees, water them, and so on. They do not see those jobs as real and useful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you talk to the women, their views are even more strongly expressed. They ask why the men should go away for two weeks from the community. The money would be paid to the men&mdash;whereas presently, the income for the community is paid to the women&mdash;and the men would spend it on alcohol. They would bring the alcohol and all sorts of other social problems back to their communities, and for what reward? They are acutely sensitive to their own social organisation and to the impact that outside forces have on it. They have seen what happened after they were herded away from this land before, and what has happened to their communities on the coast which is where they all ended up after the missions collapsed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So their views are very strong. They are not views that take any great understanding of voodoo magic or anything else. They are view of sensible, intelligent people who do not understand the issues involved in something which they can clearly see is a very important and threatening prospect for them. They want to be taken seriously. They want to be informed, and they want sufficient time allowed for them to be informed before any questions are raised about whether the uses for the land <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that they hold as desperately dearly as they do, should be changed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think all of us approach traditional Aboriginal owners in this country with a great deal of humility. We recognise the sins that have been committed by white people before us, and I think all of us are sensitive to the needs and aspirations of Aboriginals. But, in this area, their views are clear. They are the views of sensible and intelligent people and they deserve a right to be heard. I hope the Senate and the government takes due regard of their views.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to place on record some of my concerns about the current gun debate following the resolutions agreed to by the Australian police ministers at their conference on 10 May. In summary, those concerns are: firstly, to correct the mistaken impression that far right extremists are running or driving the debate, they are not; secondly, to state that gun owners have every right to put their case and to have the new laws clearly explained; and, thirdly, to state that getting the first two wrong will have the paradoxical effect of driving decent Australians unwittingly into the arms of extremists.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to my first argument, I will quote from Malcolm McGregor's column in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 12 June. He refers to those with concerns about the gun control resolution as the `detritus of the Bjelke&hyphen;Petersen army' and `Queensland's political fringe dwellers'. He implies that they have a single digit IQ, and that they form the lunatic wing of the National Party constituency&mdash;the `ratbag fringe'. This is far from true and grossly offensive to the hundreds of thousands of gun owners throughout Australia, the National Party and, I might add, the Bjelke&hyphen;Petersens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As many in this parliament know, and as the press gallery would know, I am no friend of the far right. In 1988, I gave a speech in this chamber which exposed their groupings, their modus operandi and their offensive agendas. While not exactly endearing myself <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1800"> to some parts of my electorate, this speech contributed to dampening the efforts of the far right in the late 1980s. I have continued to head them off whenever I have noticed them surfacing again. I ask you to believe, Madam Acting Deputy President, that I know what I am talking about when it comes to the far right in Australia and that I am not afraid of taking them on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, it would be more convenient for all of us if the debate was being driven by the far right. We could dismiss their concerns, as McGregor and others have done, but that is the easy path. In this case that would be to walk away from the many ordinary, law abiding Australians who want nothing to do with extremism. I say quite emphatically that the far right is not driving the gun debate in Australia. The attendance at the gun rallies over the last couple of weeks attest to that. At the Melbourne rally there were 70,000 to 100,000 people, definitely not Queensland fringe dwellers, Sydney saw 35,000 people, Brisbane saw 5,000 and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If all of these people were aligned with the extremists then Australia would be in big trouble, but they are not. It is most offensive to have the label `right wing ratbags' thrown at them. Writing them off like that is wrong. They are Australians like the rest of us. The overwhelming majority are not anti&hyphen;Semitic, racist, or believers in conspiracy theories about one&hyphen;world governments. As every day Australian workers, it is their right to take to the streets. It is their right to have their voice heard and it is their right to be given a fair go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are clerks, salespeople, panel beaters, doctors, professors, school teachers, computer operators, small business owners, train drivers and so on&mdash;responsible, law abiding citizens. Are we to dismiss them by diagnosing them as suffering from `ignorance . . . with lashings of personal paranoia and religious fundamentalism', as suggested by Geoffrey Barker in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 11 June?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> There will always be ratbags who align themselves with a cause in order to pursue their own agendas. This happens on all sides of politics and on all issues. But let us not confuse the ratbags with the average Austral ian. As always happens, the ratbag element is more colourful and sensational than anyone else so they capture a greater proportion of the media and public attention. That is, after all, what they set out to do. If we give them a profile that they want, who is the bigger fool? They are parasites who live on the hard work and sweat of honest Australians. They see an opportunity and they try to jump on the bandwagon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The atmosphere of most of the gun rally meetings has not contained the hysteria and rantings of the far right renewal of the 1980s. That movement was driven by extremists. They were the ones who organised and advertised the meetings, booked the halls and drove the debates. It was their extremist literature which was sold on trestles at the back of halls, and it was their own speakers who addressed the crowds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most of the gun rally groups, on the other hand, have been at pains to distance themselves from the obvious extremist elements. They have not always succeeded, but they have made great efforts that should be on the public record. The far right groups are very wily in insinuating themselves at these meetings. It is difficult to keep them out, but I am satisfied that there have been many attempts to restrict their presence at the major rallies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the National Party (Mr Fischer) recently commented that there was not enough done to sell the gun control agreement. That is true. It is also a fact that, until the states legislate on the agreed resolutions, it is difficult to know precisely what the detailed ramifications will be. The translation of resolutions into legislation is not straightforward, as any draftsman will tell you. There will be bumps and bruises along the way, as is to be expected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In light of these considerations, it behoves all of us to keep the debate temperate and reasonable. Surely, the legacy of Port Arthur should be unity of purpose in working out how to reduce violence in our society. `Working out' does not mean driving people into groups. Indeed, for the resolutions to work, they will need the cooperation of the very people who are being ostracised as extremists. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1801"> Pointing the finger at every gun owner in Australia and saying `You are a redneck' will not help us learn from Port Arthur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said in my speech in 1988, the groups to the far right thrive in times of frustration and dissension. Many times, that means that extremists flourish when parliament is not doing its job properly. There are two ways to put a stop to the influence of these groups. One way is to have good government policy, clearly enunciated, with a good opposition to ensure that the voices of all Australians are heard in these chambers. The other way is to know the extremists for what they are, so that citizens can make an informed choice about whether to have anything to do with them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to be wary of isolating gun owners from reasoned debate, because they then become prey to extremists. If we group them all in the one net, not only are we being unjust and effectively censoring reasonable debate but we are also running the risk of giving the extremists a ready&hyphen;made audience. Who are the real extremists? Ian McNiven is very small time, and all gun owners and industry representatives that I know will not truck with him. Every time he opens his mouth, he indicts himself. There is no fear from that quarter that he could drive any debate further than his own backyard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tony Pitt is another long&hyphen;time fringe hysteric. Apart from putting together the Cap publication <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fight</EMPHASIS>, he has popped up in other extremist publications, such as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lock, Stock and Barrel</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Strategy</EMPHASIS>. He now runs a splinter group called The Australians, and it is a very small splinter at that. Ron Owen, gun shop owner and publisher of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lock, Stock and Barrel</EMPHASIS> magazine is another loudmouthed stirrer. His magazine is a menagerie of conspiracies, revisionism, racism and anti&hyphen;Semitism. In its pages, you can read interviews with all the far right luminaries of our time, from tired old Eric Butler and Jeremy Lee of the League of Rights, to Perry Jewell of former Cap fame, and Dennis Stevenson of CEC and LaRouchian notoriety.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ron Owen has distinguished himself by inviting donations to the AWB, the white Afrikaaner resistance group, which has terrorised black South Africans. You will even find <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that Scarlet Pimpernel of the lunatic fringe, Michael Darby, contributing his disturbed ramblings from time to time. In the August&hyphen;September 1994 issue of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lock, Stock and Barrel</EMPHASIS>, Darby says families should practice drills in the event of Indonesian occupation. This involves learning rules such as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Never attack an individual unless you can be absolutely certain of killing him without witnesses; never attack a group or unit unless you are absolutely certain of killing everyone in that group or unit.</PARA>
<PARA>He recommends stockpiling poisonous snakes and spiders and states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An enemy soldier who offers to change sides rather than be killed, should be killed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite all these nasties, I would think that most of the revenue from Owen's magazine sales comes from government and other people buying it to keep an eye on what he is doing. People like Owen, MacNiven, Pitt and Darby are two&hyphen;dimensional cartoon characters who make for entertaining reading one day and sink back to political oblivion the next. If we give them leadership status in the gun debate, we only serve their agenda and boost their appeal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Graeme Campbell story is a bit different. Here you have a member of the Commonwealth parliament with the associated profile, resources and political acumen to buy more credibility than Owen and his ilk. Here you have a man who was thrown out by the socialists and who still kept his seat. He has been fawned upon by the Eric Butlers and Denis McCormacks of this world until he believes what they tell him&mdash;that he can found a successful new political movement in Australia. So he develops a three&hyphen;paragraph manifesto which generalises about manufacturing and immigration and that old nectar of the far right, CIR. He is not really setting the world on fire, even if he is making a few bucks selling his book through extremist networks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then along comes Port Arthur and the gun control issue: a hell&hyphen;sent opportunity. Most Australians still think of Graeme Campbell as being that maverick Labor guy from Western Australia. They cheer him on because he got stuck into Keating. But he is more than that. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1802"> His long&hyphen;time political buddies, Australians against further immigration, are bedfellows with most of the extremists in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One AAFI candidate in the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> on 15 April 1994 said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My policies on refugees and illegals is to reopen the second Yallah meatworks, creating up to 500 local jobs, and convert them to blood and bone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In January of this year, before the last federal election, Eric Butler and Jeremy Lee of the League of Rights held a meeting on the Gold Coast to drum up support for Graeme Campbell's political movement. They already had their sights set on the 1999 elections. One fellow was to run a candidate training school for Campbell candidates. Eric Butler waxed lyrical about Campbell, likening him to Menzies. Butler said Campbell had similar policies to the League, for example immigration and CIR. He said that there were women at recent Melbourne meetings who said, `Oh, if we could just touch him.' Jeremy Lee sold Campbell's lecture booklets for $5 a touch.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a more disturbing link between Campbell's friends and American extremists. Let me remind the Senate what Campbell has said about the AAFI's Denis McCormack. In a letter to voters in April 1992, he wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have no hesitation in recommending Denis McCormack as an intelligent and courageous Australian.</PARA>
<PARA>On Australia Day this year, Campbell, in conjunction with the AAFI, made a policy launch speech, in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the state of Victoria, I intend to endorse the AAFI candidates in places 1 and 2. I think Robin and Denis are excellent candidates and Denis, as Number 1, has an excellent chance of being elected. I believe he deserves to win and, believe me, Australia needs him to win.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>The same AAFI were a significant presence at the Melbourne seminar by Jack McLamb. Denis McCormack, amongst others, attended. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia Israel Review</EMPHASIS> 's Adam Indikt reported in the December 1995 issue that AAFI cassettes and Campbell's book, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia Betrayed</EMPHASIS> , were on sale.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Adam Indikt says that `several of those involved in the McLamb event had also helped organise and been present at a public <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> meeting held by AAFI at the Lilydale Motor Inn on October 27'. Jack McLamb's visit was allegedly organised by Ray Platt, the editor of the extreme publication <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Strategy</EMPHASIS>, which is a haven for various fringe elements, including the AAFI.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Jack McLamb is an American militiaman. He is a partner with Bo Gritz, a one&hyphen;time Vice&hyphen;Presidential nominee on the ticket of former Ku Klux Klansmen David Duke. McLamb is a notorious figure amongst US citizen militia groups, ready for armed insurgence against the global planners in their government. After the Oklahoma bombing incident, the American media profiled groups with similar conspiracy leanings as the accused bomber. McLamb and his associates all featured prominently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Pittsburgh Post Gazette</EMPHASIS> of April 23 1994 reported that McLamb `cites racial intermarriage as religiously offensive and part of a one&hyphen;world conspiracy'. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Denver Post</EMPHASIS> on 30 April 1995 described McLamb as `one of the nation's most militant militia organisers' and said that he had `purchased an 80&hyphen;acre parcel adjoining Gritz's white supremacist land development project where, if you buy an allotment, you also get military training thrown in'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this man can contribute to Australian society I do not know. But the real point is that Campbell's friends, whom he has repeatedly and publicly endorsed, obviously believe the Jack McLambs of the world should be encouraged. Mr Campbell has tried to distance himself from another American extremist, Lyndon LaRouche, who went to gaol for robbing old ladies of their life savings. Much as he tries, however, Campbell can never get himself away from the fact that he signed a petition calling for the exoneration of Lyndon LaRouche. It is in black and white on the back of several CEC newspapers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This group is really weird. They blame Prince Philip for the genocide in Rwanda; in the United States they have associations with everyone from the Ku Klux Klanners to the Teamsters Union and Manuel Noriega&mdash;a real nice bunch. Do not insult the intelligence of thousands of gun owners by telling them that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1803"> those lunatics are driving the gun debate. They hamper it. They do not drive it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My attitude to the gun control resolutions is, I hope, a reasonable one. Let's communicate with all the legitimate stakeholders so we can make the resolutions work. A positive approach, not a punitive name&hyphen;calling one, is needed. Attacking gun owners will meet with nothing but resistance. It must be accepted and known amongst the community that people at these rallies give near unanimous support to the banning of semiautomatic military assault style rifles. Like it or not, it is apparent that gun ownership is widely spread throughout our community, both rural and urban.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Accepting significant changes to a deeply embedded cultural icon was never going to be easy. Irresponsible comments which alienate stakeholders from either side of the debate just make it more difficult. Port Arthur did not happen so that Australian society should go backwards and become more divided, and provide a platform for extremists. If anyone is allowed to use the tragedy to further their political career we have lost the plot. Port Arthur demands workable remedies, not political opportunism.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<TIME.STAMP>(1.30 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate Senator Boswell on much of his speech.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For some time now, the Liberal and National parties have asserted that the public sector must be reduced and that the role of the public sector should be revised. This ideological drive for less government support for the people of Australia remains a debatable issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Immediately following the March election, the new government announced that two per cent would be cut from public expenditure. This was followed by the apparent discovery of an underlying budget deficit which has been the dubious justification for the coalition government's cuts of $8 billion over two years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we did not know was that the states would bear the brunt of the cuts and that the negotiations with the states would turn to farce. In a paper distributed by the University <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of New South Wales, John Quiggin examines from where the apparent budget deficit has appeared. The conclusion is that the figures are derived from revised, lower estimates of economic growth which are not convincing and the impact of which is exaggerated. Quiggin states that the deficit is amongst the lowest in the OECD and that the levels of debt are far from unsustainable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So this conservative government has fabricated a debt for its own purposes and is foisting that debt onto the states. To put it bluntly, the states are getting done. The outcome of the Premiers Conference last week can be put simply: the states have been done for $2 billion over two years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By forgoing indexation of the financial assistance grants, the states will lose $644 million in the first year. The three per cent cut to special purpose programs&mdash;excluding universities, that is&mdash;amounts to about $400 million in the first year. Combined, that is $1 billion each year for two years. Therefore, the states have accepted cuts of $2 billion which, for the government, is supposed to represent a quarter of the mythical debt. That means the states will have been asked to contribute one&hyphen;quarter of this mythical debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One billion dollars per year translates into 50,000 jobs, which includes the multiplier effect. Tasmania's proportion of that is 1,500 jobs in one year and 3,000 over two years. Why would the states accept this? One reason is that they were given no choice. Another possible reason is that there is an as yet unannounced sweetener in the untying of the tied grants, giving the states greater discretionary powers over the moneys required for matched funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to ask what these cuts will do to Tasmania. Full sales tax will be imposed on executive vehicles, with a cost to the state of $3 million. There will be a three per cent cut in specific purpose payments, being about $11 million. Where specific purpose payments are paid through the state to others&mdash;for example, for higher education, non&hyphen;government schools and local government&mdash;the three per cent maximum does not apply, so cuts probably will be greater than three per cent.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1804">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The states had been promised increases in financial assistance grants. The states have forgone these so as not to lose full sales tax exemption. What is the cost to Tasmania? It will be $16 million this year, $17 million next year and $8 million the year after that. That is in addition to an already anticipated state budget deficit of about $30 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How is Tasmania going to cover this? Several options have been suggested. One is to increase taxes and charges. Another is the sale of the Hydro&hyphen;Electric Commission. The third is a possible Costello&hyphen;style levy. To put it in perspective, the proposed cuts are equal to 40 per cent of the running cost of the Tasmanian police force. We are talking about potential job losses of 1,500.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why did the premiers not challenge the whole concept of the mythical debt? Why did the premiers not see that the federal government was using unsubstantiated financial claims to rake moneys from the states? Why did Tasmania's Premier Tony Rundle not put Tasmania's case? Why did Premier Rundle not point out that, because Tasmania's economy is running at one&hyphen;sixth the growth rate of the other states, Tasmania simply cannot afford to wear cuts at the same rate? The states did not expect that the government would act in such an incompetent manner on these issues&mdash;or did we understand all along that the Liberal and National parties are incapable of offering effective and responsible government?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me just remind you of what is being done to Tasmania. I have already mentioned the loss of sales tax exemption and the cuts in both specific purpose and financial assistance grants. There is also the slashing of our vital labour market programs, the threats to our only university, and whatever will come from the devolution of responsibility for aged care and other services. What is being done to our vital public sector is appalling. As of 5 June, we know that 9,588 public sector jobs will go in the pre&hyphen;budget round. Two thousand of those jobs are going from the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. Of these two thousand, 800 people are losing their jobs to pay for the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> department's aggregate redundancies. That is 40 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This department is responsible for, amongst other things, the delivery of Working Nation programs. One of the principles of Working Nation was to provide greater resources for training for the long&hyphen;term unemployed in those regions with the highest levels of unemployment. Tasmania is one such region. Madam Acting Deputy President, over the last two years more than two&hyphen;thirds of the drop in unemployment in Tasmania has been in the long&hyphen;term unemployed category, which is directly attributable to Working Nation programs. Also, by extrapolating the figures known from cuts to the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, it is disturbing to calculate that, of the 310 redundancies from the Commonwealth departments in Tasmania, 124 of these job losses will be instituted simply to fund the redundancy program. In other words, over one&hyphen;third of the cuts in Tasmania have not been carried out for any functional reasons, but simply to fund the aggregate redundancies. This is, bluntly, incompetent fiscal policy. This demonstrates the inept and callous nature of this government, where individuals have become expendable and where valuable people are being used to meet the government's ill&hyphen;constructed financial bottom line.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Acting Deputy President, on 13 June this year I attended the opening of the Law School at the University of Notre Dame in Fremantle, Western Australia. Notre Dame is Australia's first Catholic university. It commenced teaching in January 1992. Notre Dame has two campuses, one in Fremantle and the other in Broome, Western Australia. One of the features of the university is that its academic year differs from that of other Australian universities because of its relationship with the University of Notre Dame in the United States. The academic year commences in early February, with its first semester lasting until May. This is followed by a winter term, which runs from June until <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1805"> mid-August, with the second semester beginning in August and ending in December.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The university was set up by an act of parliament in Western Australia in 1989 and is owned, controlled and operated by a board of trustees and a board of governors. The university has a close relationship with the University of Notre Dame in Indiana in the United States, and it has drawn much of its founding inspiration and philosophy from that university. It is worth while to note, whilst we are looking at the question of funding for higher education institutions, that Notre Dame is not funded by the Commonwealth. In fact, that university is a living example of what can be done by the private sector in eduction. The fee in relation to Notre Dame is $690 per unit for full-time Australian students and $1,220 per unit for full-time overseas students. Needless to say, the service of overseas students is a growing area, and the export of education generally is a growing area for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At present there are 1,000 students enrolled, and law enrolments will not be opened until next year. As I understand it, the university, in contrast to Bond University, is more economical in its costs and overheads in relation to the cost per student per annum. Having visited the Notre Dame campus, I can say that much has been done to economise on expenditure without any sacrifice in quality. This is perhaps something that public universities could well take heed of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In closing, the university aims to be faithful to the intellectual and spiritual ideals which have been the foundation of the great Catholic universities of the world. Like them, Notre Dame Australia seeks to be a leader in scholarship and education. Basically, there are four main objectives of the university: first, to provide, through teaching, pastoral care and personal development, for the total education of its students; second, to support an academic community noted for its excellence; third, to support the role and work of the church in Australia; and, fourth, to make a special contribution to the economic and social development of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At present, the university has four colleges&mdash;namely, arts and sciences, business, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> education, and theology. The two campuses contribute greatly to the local communities in Fremantle and Broome. I believe Notre Dame, as a university, will contribute greatly to the future of young Australians. I look forward to the intake of law students at the law school in 1997 and I congratulate all the staff associated with its development, especially Geraldine Byrne, the law school secretary, and Mary Eileen Gaunt, the registrar. I believe that the opening of this law school at Notre Dame will be one of the steps along the way in the success story that will be Notre Dame Australia.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<STATE> (New South Wales)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(1.42 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government is examining a re&hyphen;writing of the tax act. As I understand it, the first instalment of that will be introduced into this chamber shortly. What I raise today relates to the need to redefine and to correct some of the problems that have emerged from some elements of tax law, particularly those that were used improperly in the House of Representatives in respect of criticism of me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate may recall that last year the House of Representatives passed a resolution condemning me for, allegedly, revealing a tax file number in a document presented to this chamber. Apart from the political stunt involved in that activity by the previous government&mdash;it was in fact the then Treasurer, Mr Willis, who moved the resolution&mdash;the reality is that at no stage was the number ever identified as a tax file number. It was claimed in the House of Representatives at that time that I was protected from the consequences and the penalties of such an offence by parliamentary privilege. Of course, that is totally false, but it was among a whole range of false accusations made at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there are to be offences for revealing a tax file number, it is absolutely vital that the tax file number be identified as such. In the law, as it stands at present, there is no requirement for a tax file number to be identified on a document as a tax file number. The document that I presented to this chamber had a whole series of other reference numbers in front of what turned out to be a tax file <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1806"> number. I can evidence the fact that this would not necessarily be identified as a tax file number by referring to evidence given by a tax officer to a Senate estimates committee. I asked the tax officer:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Will you explain to me what the words `our reference' mean on an Australian Taxation Office letter?</PARA>
<PARA>This was the particular letter that I had tabled.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, the letter states `our reference' then `13/BA51' followed by a series of numbers. What do the words `our reference' mean?</PARA>
<PARA>The tax officer responded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That would be an in&hyphen;house identification of the source of that document. I do not know precisely what the `13' or the `BA' stands for. The `BA' may be the initials of the writer. The `13' may indicate the branch office from which the letter came. I would imagine the numbers to which you did not refer possibly were the equivalent of a tax file number.</PARA>
<PARA>His words were `possibly were the equivalent of a tax file number.' I went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So that may include some numbers which could possibly be a tax file number? I am just summarising; is that basically what you said?</PARA>
<PARA>I wanted to get it absolutely clear from the tax office that that was the situation. His response was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It could, yes.</PARA>
<PARA>I then went on to ask:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So is revealing our reference number, which may possibly include a tax file number but which is, in fact, your internal reference number, an offence?</PARA>
<PARA>The tax officer responded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would have to take advice on that particular issue. I would imagine that if the item of information was not described as a tax file number it may well be hard to prove that it was an offence.</PARA>
<PARA>That was the tax office advice. If it was not identified as a tax file number, as it was not in this case, then it might well be hard to prove that it was an offence and, in fact, you might well not know by looking at it that it was a tax file number.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the concern of the tax office that in fact revealing a tax file number when it is not evidently a tax file number may make it very difficult for the tax office to proceed against someone who makes such a revelation. Clearly, it is both in the tax office's interest and in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the interests of people, such as I, who innocently gave a reference number which included a tax file number, that on both accounts we be protected by a better law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tax office will clearly have great difficulty pursuing people for breaking the law in relation to tax file numbers unless the tax file number is identified as a tax file number. How curious it is that the tax office is saying, `Yes, it is a bad situation and it makes things difficult for us. Yes, it may possibly not be recognisable as a tax file number.' How different that is from the resolution, passed by the House of Representatives, which condemned me. In part, it reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) Senator Baume, in seeking the leave of the duty Minister and the Senate to table the documents in question, did not draw attention to the tax file number identified therein . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is a simple, uncomplicated lie. There was no tax file number identified therein. Mr Willis, the minister, knew that perfectly well at the time, and it was a fact reinforced by the opinion given to the Senate estimates committee by the tax officer who appeared before that committee. There was no identified tax file number. The basis on which I was condemned by the House of Representatives&mdash;and, I might say, also criticised in this chamber&mdash;was totally and absolutely false.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that it may be appropriate for that chamber, now that it is no longer dominated by people who seek to make political capital out of a stunt like this, to withdraw that quite improper condemnation of me for doing what was right and what was clearly legal at the time. It is incredible that the minister, Mr Willis, accused me of indulging in what from any other person would be a criminal action; yet we have just heard that the tax officer involved said that it would be very difficult to establish that, and that it was only `possible' that the figures revealed were the equivalent of a tax file number, maybe. In other words, the present law is absurd.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But even worse, it seems to me, than the absurdity of the present law, is the way that the previous Labor government misused it in a personal vendetta against me simply on the grounds, of course, that I had offended the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1807"> then Prime Minister, Mr Keating, by revealing information he did not want revealed about his extraordinary misuse while Prime Minister of his office to enrich himself as a result of personal activity and personal investments. It has been a tradition in this place that this sort of thing should not take place, and in the past it has not. But because of this personal vendetta against me, we had the House of Representatives being grossly misused and, as I said, Mr Willis was prepared to say things like this about me:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">His actions engaged in by anyone outside this place would amount to criminal behaviour&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>not `may', not `might', but&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">would amount to criminal behaviour and may even amount to criminal behaviour by him.</PARA>
<PARA>And yet we know perfectly well that the tax officer said, `It may have been a tax file number but it was not identified as such.' At no stage was it identified as a tax file number.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, it may well be that Mr Willis was simply relying on the extraordinary and politically very convenient advice he received from another officer in the Taxation Office. I have already expressed my concerns about the way that particular officer, Mr P.E. Simpson, the second commissioner, was prepared to go on the record as saying in a confidential memorandum which, in my view, was grossly and improperly tabled by Mr Willis:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the tabling of the information, which I understand included a TFN&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>`I understand', he said, `included a TFN'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">by Senator Baume is prima facie an offence under section 8WB and possibly of section 8XB.</PARA>
<PARA>No, the second commissioner did not understand too damn well because when he said that he understood that it included a TFN, it was not a TFN identified as such. It was part of `our reference number', and it included a whole lot of other figures, as I have already outlined to this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact remains that the use of this device as a way of beating me around the head because of the way I have been effectively pointing out the improper behaviour of Mr Keating and, in particular, his partner&mdash;to whom Mr Keating had given his power of attorney several years before that&mdash;is clear <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> evidence, I believe, of a misuse of that chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tax officer then followed up his quite improper recommendation to the minister, by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has, however, clearly been a breach of section 8WB and that breach has a number of dimensions</PARA>
<PARA>and one of the dimensions that relates to me is</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the disclosure of that information by the Senator.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, it is simply ludicrous that the law should be so badly worded that it is an offence to reveal a tax file number without the tax file number being identified as a tax file number.</PARA>

<PARA>That is simply false and it is recognised to be false except, of course, by all those sitting opposite, who have a particularly one&hyphen;eyed view of how to take smart alec political points without regard for decency and integrity and for the duty of people in this place to reveal what should be revealed for particular purposes. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">His action amounts to criminal behaviour . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I am continually being accused by the Labor Party of criminal behaviour with no evidence whatsoever to support it. On the contrary, evidence in Senate estimates committees has clearly shown that it is baseless because, in fact, the tax file number was never identified as a tax file number. There is an obvious need not only to clear up the disgraceful attack on me but also to clean up this legislation so that no-one else ends up in a situation of being <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1808"> improperly accused of criminal behaviour and of being saved from criminal prosecution because of parliamentary privilege.

This is after Labor assured us time and again that there would be no forecast deficit at all. Senator Cook in the Senate said, `Don't worry about it; it will be in surplus.' During the election, Mr Beazley said that it will be in surplus. Mr Keating said that it will be in surplus. When we said, `Open the books', they said no. Furthermore, they said that if you open the books, you would not see in any event; the results would not be there. But the day after the election, there they were. Labor hid it from the Australian people&mdash;$8,000 million of forecast deficit. That is what we inherited and now we have a responsibility to do something about it. We expected the states to take a part of that burden.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did read an interview in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> , which resulted from what was described as an Australian-American leadership dialogue involving participants from both nations. One of those participating was Kim Beazley. One would have thought that with all his experience as a previous minister for communications, and as someone who professes to strut the world stage, he would have at least a basic understanding. I was absolutely appalled&mdash;and I am sure other senators will be as well&mdash;at what Mr Beazley had to say in this interview with Paul Kelly. He started off by saying:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I've got a view on Telstra which is distinct.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My view is that Telstra performs a function in Australia that there is no equivalent of in the United States.</PARA>
<PARA>I thought Telstra delivered telecommunications services and telephone calls. I would like to know what Mr Beazley was doing when he was in the US. Was he living in a tent? Was he communicating with his American colleagues by smoke signals or carrier pigeons? Was he simply not even aware that they have telephones in the United States? It is a pretty extraordinary start to an interview, I would have thought. Then he goes on to say:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no electronics industry in Australia without a publicly owned Telstra&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">just as there is no electronics industry in New Zealand.  <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1812"> </PARA>
<PARA>The fact is that New Zealand at the present time is going ahead in leaps and bounds. In 1990, its export of telecommunications equipment totalled $43 million. In the year to June 1996, its exports are expected to exceed $200 million and by the turn of the century $400 million. So to suggest that somehow the privatisation of Telstra New Zealand has led to the demise of the electronics industry is absolutely contrary to any possible understanding of the facts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Beazley trotted this sort of nonsense out at the ALP state conference in Victoria a few weeks back. I can perhaps understand him telling a few porkies to the party faithful. That is one thing, but to go onto the international stage and make a complete fool of himself, in the way that he did on this occasion, is very damaging to our international reputation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These people are entitled to think that if you are attending a leadership forum you would at least show a bit of leadership. They did not expect some bloke to go over there, dragged by the ear by the trade union movement, pandering to fear and ignorance in Australia and somehow pretending that he has an understanding of what is going on in the country. He went on in that interview to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If you try to simultaneously privatise and introduce competition, you'll compromise one or the other.</PARA>
<PARA>The fact is that we introduced competition in this country five years ago. Do you know who the minister was at that time? Kim Beazley. I do not know what his defence is. Is he saying that he read the bill but did not look at the contents? Is he somehow not even aware of what has been going on in Australia in the last five years? Is he not aware that our electronics industry depends entirely on Telstra complying with licence requirements which obligate it to use best endeavours. That is precisely what will happen after Telstra is privatised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a major international embarrassment for Australia. You blokes have some hard thinking to do if you think you can get away with a leader like this, who should never be allowed out of the country again until he has undergone a re&hyphen;education program. It is simply not good enough to go to the sub&hyphen; <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> branch of the Lenin institute for public ownership of everything that moves.</PARA>

The New South Wales Premier broke that promise immediately after the election.

I refer to a statement made by the Prime Minister, and reported in yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> , where he claimed that wage restraint would be justified because interest rates on home mortgages are coming down.

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think Senator Cook is aware of what has been happening to home mortgage rates in this country. I am pleased to have this opportunity to inform him and the Senate of the fall in interest rates for housing that has occurred over recent weeks as a result of increased competition in the banking industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 31 May, the Commonwealth Bank cut its variable home mortgage rate from 10.5 per cent to 9.9 per cent. ANZ followed suit shortly thereafter. The National Australia Bank did it also, as did the Commonwealth and Westpac by varying degrees. Almost 70 per cent of all home lending comes from those four banks. That means that the cuts in rates from 10&half; per cent to 9&frac34;per cent has led to a benefit of $53 per month for a household with a 25&hyphen;year $100,000 home loan. That is of major benefit to most Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It ought to be welcomed by the opposition. It is certainly very warmly welcomed by the government because it is in stark contrast with the interest rate record of the previous government over more recent years. The Labor government had home mortgage rates at 17 per <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1815"> cent in 1990 as part of its quite deliberate policy to engineer a massive recession&mdash;the greatest recession we have had since the 1960s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That caused a whole range of problems through the economy, including pushing unemployment to rates that would never have been believed in this country&mdash;that is, above 11 per cent, above a million people unemployed. In terms of the movement in interest rates, they are unequivocally down, which is welcome news. So the premise on which your question is based has no substance.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Ngunytju Tjitji Pirni project was established primarily as a research project securing the vast majority of its funds from an NHMRC research grant, although there were other sources of funding, I understand, available to them. I am advised that the federal government has not withdrawn funding. The office of the NHMRC has not received any <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1816"> reports to date from the organisation and has not received a submission for funding in 1996-97.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Department of Health and Family Services has asked the NHMRC to send a copy of the final summary report and any other reports from the organisation to assist in assessment and negotiation of future funding needs of the service. The organisation also receives funding under the department's healthy women, strong families initiative, which commenced in the last financial year and which will be supported as a recurrent program from 1996-97 with funds provided by the Office for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Services.</PARA>

What is your response to research by Ms Hanson of the benefits available to indigenous and non&hyphen;indigenous Australians?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="1816" SPEAKER="Herron, Sen John" NAMEID="VW4" ELECTORATE="QLD" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VW4">Senator HERRON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Ellison for his question. Most importantly, I <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1817"> would like to make it very clear that I am disappointed with Ms Hanson's statements regarding financial assistance to Aboriginal Australians. She made the comment:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Why the financial burdens and hardships of families of comparable income differ due to Aboriginality is a mystery.</PARA>
<PARA>I would like to point out to Ms Hanson that, if she cares to look at the research available, Aboriginal Australians are far more disadvantaged than non&hyphen;Aboriginal Australians and therefore require greater assistance. Most disadvantaged groups in a democratic society are given some government assistance. That is not to say that we want to encourage welfare dependence. Most fair&hyphen;minded people in this country would acknowledge that indigenous Australians are living in appalling conditions and do require assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the last three months I have visited many Aboriginal communities that have taken the initiative to try to improve their situation. Many participate in CDEP, a work for the dole scheme, when they would be better off financially by being on welfare. In the Northern Territory I was impressed by a strong women program started by local volunteers to combat domestic violence and reduce health problems. These are two examples of Aboriginal Australians helping themselves to improve their living conditions, but there are many more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to cite some research taken from the 1994&hyphen;95 ATSIC annual report which illustrates just how big the gulf is between Aboriginal and non&hyphen;Aboriginal Australians. For example, in education, while indigenous participation levels are improving, the gap with non&hyphen;Aboriginal rates remains wide. I quote from the report that between 1985 and 1992 the retention rate to year 12 of Aboriginal students rose from 14 per cent to 25 per cent. Rates for other students in the same period, however, rose from 58 per cent to 78 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the 1991 census, one in two Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 15&hyphen; to 19&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds stated they had left school at age 16 or younger, compared with one in four non&hyphen;Aboriginal Australians in this age group. The 1991 census also showed that among 20&hyphen; to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 24&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds the proportion of Aboriginal Australians attending educational institutions was about one&hyphen;third of the non&hyphen;Aboriginal rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Chamarette mentioned earlier, maternal and infant mortality rates are higher for Aboriginal Australians, with Aboriginal mothers 10 times more likely to die than non&hyphen;Aboriginal mothers. At any age, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are twice as likely to die prematurely as non&hyphen;Aboriginal Australians. For Aboriginal people aged 25 to 44, the risk is five times greater. The list goes on and on in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, I want to express again my disappointment over Ms Hanson's comments. She should stop and consider the hardship and disadvantage that many Aboriginal people face on a daily basis, often through no fault of their own.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, my attention was drawn to the article. I find it quite strange how close some members in this chamber are to the views that Mr Nash was propounding. But it is really rather sad, because Mr Nash's group has not been one of the many groups with whom I have consulted over the government's proposed changes to housing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As you would remember, Mr President, there were not too many members of the opposition who wanted to listen to the long list of women's organisations with whom I had consulted on women's issues. Perhaps they might be interested to know that I have met with ACOSS, the National Shelter, the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Community Housing Federation of Australia, the National Community Housing Forum, the Housing Industry Association, and the list goes on. Unfortunately, perhaps due to my newness in the portfolio, I was not aware of Mr Nash, but I would be very happy to see him if he would like to make an appointment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The interesting thing is that housing and community groups did not express concerns about these proposals when they were announced last year by the previous government. Their response to our proposals this year has been positive as well, because they are very positive for tenants whether they are in the private sector or the public sector. It is going to mean flexibility for people as to where they live. It is going to mean a reduction in the waiting lists of people in public housing, because the 200,000 people who are currently waiting for a home will be given a higher level of financial subsidy. If they want to rent in the private sector, then they are able to at the moment. They have an opportunity to live near where they can find work or where they have family support, et cetera.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a huge discrepancy at the present time in the assistance that goes to renters in the private sector and the renters in the public sector. For example, at the moment the average Commonwealth rent assistance for those in private accommodation is around $1,500 a year. But, if you live in public housing, you receive an average annual subsidy of $4,000 a year from the state housing authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People renting from the private sector are the people who are paying high rents. They are the most disadvantaged members in our community. It is important and imperative that we give them more equity and justice. Far from being caught in poverty traps, as they are now, these people are going to be able to exercise real choice because the money will be in their hands for them to be make a choice between public and private. They are not going to be banished to the outer rim of the city. They are going to be able to make a choice to live where their support network or their job opportunities are. They will do that because they have a higher <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1821"> level of rent assistance if they choose to rent privately.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Nash also claims that rental subsidies are the most expensive form of housing assistance. I say to him that maintenance of ageing housing stock is the most expensive form of housing assistance you can give. For the state housing authorities, which have been slipping further and further behind in many states in the maintenance of their housing stock, housing assistance will give them an opportunity to get better rents for their housing. That will mean they are going to be able to keep those houses in a better state of repair. Also, the private rental market will get a boost and so will the construction industry. It seems to me, whether you are in the private or the public sector, whether you are a state or in private enterprise in the building industry, there is a win&hyphen;win for all. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sales Tax on Motor Vehicles</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Questions directed to the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Short by Senator Lundy (Senate, Monday, 17 June 1996)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. Given that sales tax will apply to privately plated vehicles controlled by the federal government, can the minister inform the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> How many such vehicles will be affected?;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> What revenue will be raised?;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> What will be the administrative cost of removing this exemption? <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1822"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Responses:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of the 50,000 or so vehicles in the Commonwealth sector, about half have already been purchased with sales tax paid. The exemption from sales tax on purchases by Commonwealth trading enterprises such as Telstra and Australia Post was removed in May 1987. This included their exemption on cars.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DASFLEET manages a fleet of about eighteen thousand vehicles. Of these, only about two and a half thousand are provided for private use as part of remuneration and therefore will be affected by the Government's announcement. Based on this estimate, and assuming that some 60% of these vehicles are replaced annually, about $10 million is expected to be raised from this measure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Based on the best information currently available, the preliminary estimate of the impact of the measure across the whole of the Commonwealth, State, Territory and local government sector is in the order of $50 million to $100 million. This compares with the revenue estimates reported in the press, which are in the order of $80 million to $100 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The extent to which Commonwealth Departments and agencies will be supplemented for this additional cost is a matter for consideration in the context of the forthcoming Budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The administrative cost of removing the measure is not considered to be significant. There will be some reduction in the administrative costs of motor vehicle dealers as fewer exemptions will be claimed and there will be a corresponding reduction in the paper work they need to process. For Government bodies there will be some increase in administrative costs as particular bodies assess which vehicles they are entitled to purchase free of tax. In many cases this assessment will be straightforward. In others, it may be necessary to consider the purpose for which the vehicle is being purchased whereas previously all vehicles were purchased free of tax.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. Further on the issue of the exemptions:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Minister, can you guarantee that the exemptions administered by your department will continue to apply to TPI pensioners?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">TPI pensioners will retain their existing entitlement to sales tax exemptions on the purchase of motor vehicles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is, those pensioners (for example veterans in receipt of a special rate of pension as a result of being totally and permanently incapacitated from war&hyphen;caused injury or disease) will continue to be eligible to apply for motor vehicle sales tax exemption under sub&hyphen;item 96(1) in Schedule 1 to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1992 as before. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA></QUESTION></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Short), to questions without notice asked by Senator Schacht today, relating to sales tax legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>There is a black hole in the Australian economy. That black hole is called Senator Short. In this chamber we have become used to the stumbling, bumbling, incompetent, inept performances of Senator Short, but to that litany of sad truths about his application as a minister, one now has to add the word `misleading' to the performances by Senator Short. Today, again, he continued to mislead this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer the Senate to the answers that he gave to Senator Faulkner today and yesterday. When he answered Senator Faulkner yesterday he said, `You don't know that you've got it wrong again and what you're saying is not in conformity with the act.' Facts have revealed that what Senator Faulkner said was right and was in conformity with the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now have a pallid imitation of an apology from Senator Short to set the record right, but no apology for his shameful remarks about Senator Faulkner. Nonetheless, let us avoid that because we have become used to Senator Short's arrogance, bombast and ignorance, not to mention name calling in this chamber. Let us go to the facts. Senator Faulkner did not get it wrong. The important thing here is the misleading that Senator Short himself has engaged in. The question put to Senator Short today, in part, was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`The Treasurer's first announcement was an offer made to the states.'</PARA>
<PARA>The question continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the press release issued by the Treasurer on June 11 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has decided to remove the exemption from sales tax currently enjoyed by the Commonwealth, State and Territory and Local Governments.</PARA>
<PARA>The question concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Why did you mislead the Senate on that matter?</PARA>
<PARA>To students of the English language, that may appear to be a pedantic point, but we are <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1823"> talking here about tax law. That is not a soft issue; that is a heavy issue. We are talking about utterances by the Assistant Treasurer, who is in a position of authority in respect of this act and is supposed to know and whose words are bullets in a debate like this. There is a whole industry out there depending on what interpretation the government is putting on these words. There is a whole industry out there that litigates profusely about any differences or variations in these words and it is incumbent upon an Assistant Treasurer, as it is incumbent upon a Treasurer, to use these words with sage deliberation as to their true meaning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Short did not do that. The only conclusion one can come to is that he did not do that deliberately because he knew he had a political hot potato on his plate. The foray by the federal government in order to shift sales tax responsibilities onto the states blew up, became a debacle and the federal government backed down under pressure from the states and saved out of that mess and political embarrassment a couple of elements of their original proposal. That does not in any way deviate from the fact that they made an announcement on the 11th and not on the 14th of this month which triggered certain consequential steps in the federal act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only defence Senator Short can give to this blatant and obvious misleading is that he did not know&mdash;in which case he pleads guilty to the lesser charge of incompetence. But whichever way you go, he is guilty of either misleading or incompetence. That is a performance that we have become very well versed in over recent days and weeks as he has tried to conduct himself as Assistant Treasurer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will just leave that point for the moment and go to the point of the question that I asked Senator Short. It is true that the Prime Minister said that, because of interest rate falls&mdash;which, by the way, are because of the extra competition between the banks which was introduced by the Labor government, not by this government&mdash;wage claims should somehow be reduced. The obvious corollary of that is that if interest rates go up or state taxes and charges rise and battlers' wages are <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> eroded accordingly, there is justification for a wage claim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Short never answered any of those questions because, again, he is embarrassed. What we have here is an example of the Prime Minister saying that in fact the claims that apparently the ACTU will lodge are justified, but one should regard all indicators, not just the tax indicators. That is what the Prime Minister has said. The avoidance of that question here today again shows how quickly this government has become out of touch. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Treasurer's first announcement was an offer to the states . . .  <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>He used these words in an attempt to weasel and wimp his way out of a difficult situation&mdash;the debacle of the Premiers Conference. He used those words `the Treasurer's first announcement was an offer to the states'. Of course, the press release from the Treasurer is absolutely clear. That press release, dated 11 June, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has decided to remove the exemption from sales tax currently enjoyed by Commonwealth, State, Territory and Local Governments.</PARA>
<PARA>It continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The removal of the wholesale sales tax exemption for general purpose road vehicles purchased or leased by Commonwealth, State and local governments is to have immediate effect.</PARA>
<PARA>It is absolutely clear&mdash;a black and white case of Senator Short having misled this Senate again on a very important matter. The record of Senator Short in terms of his capacity to answer any question directed to him by the opposition is abysmal.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He talked today about his responsibility versus the responsibilities of the Tax Commissioner. Senator Short is the Assistant Treasurer of this country.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come to another point. Senator Schacht misled the parliament in a question today.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The issue today, covered in a number of questions, is in two different parts. Senator Short said, `This was a matter for the taxation commissioner and it is not for me', even though he is the minister, under the executive arrangements, responsible for the Taxation Office. He is trying to say that the minister in this parliament is not responsible for answering questions about any statutory authority under Commonwealth legislation, if you take Senator Short's response today to its logical conclusion. That is absurd.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all knew when we were ministers that whether it was a statutory authority under whatever form, we had to answer the questions in the parliament people asked you about what they were doing, even though there might be an independent board, a chief executive, a statutory office holder. No&hyphen;one accepted that you could stand up and say, `That is not for me. That is for the taxation commissioner. Go and ask him.' That is what Senator Short has tried to say today on these matters about the timing of the statement, the press releases, the newspaper advertising and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Short has also said that the reason he made a mistake in misleading the Senate yesterday is that he was advised by an `officer of the Taxation Office'. It is in his statement this morning:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1827">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Immediately on the conclusion of question time, I provided the Senate with some additional advice that my office had received in the interim from a senior officer of the Taxation Office.</PARA>
<PARA>It does not actually say who it was. We got a letter tabled today from the taxation commissioner apologising for that advice. But yesterday in the debate Senator Short on three occasions referred to his advice as coming from the taxation commissioner. On page 1689 of yesterday's Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The commissioner and the tax office are of course aware of this.</PARA>
<PARA>Then, on page 1691 he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is certainly what the taxation commissioner believes and it is certainly the date from which the taxation commissioner is working. If I have to put my money on whether it is Senator Faulkner or the taxation commissioner who is right in the interpretation of the tax act, it is no contest.</PARA>
<PARA>Finally, on page 1996 Senator Short says as an interjection to Senator Sherry:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Are you saying that the taxation commissioner is wrong?</PARA>
<PARA>Even in Senator Campbell's remarks he again confirms that it is the taxation commissioner, but I will not hold Senator Campbell responsible for the problems of Senator Short, which are all totally self&hyphen;inflicted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday in the debate the taxation commissioner was quoted by Senator Short as his authority. Today it is some unnamed lower officer who was at fault. That is the reason that Senator Short says, `I got it wrong.' He has again misled. He says that we have got it wrong. What we want to know is why he was quoting yesterday the taxation commissioner as the source of his authority and his advice and then had to apologise this morning in his statement&mdash;it is no longer the taxation commissioner who gave him the advice, it is a senior officer of the Australian Taxation Office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clear that there is a significant difference in the bumbling mistake this minister has made. He ought to come clean today and point out who he got the advice from. Was it from the commissioner? Was it the commissioner in the days leading up to when you were speaking yesterday? Who was the officer who suddenly has been put in the gun?</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also ask: if the officer has made such a serious mistake, what penalty or disciplinary action has the taxation commissioner taken against such officer for giving you advice which you now say was wrong? This officer, you are saying, is responsible for giving advice to you which you gave to the Senate which was misleading and not the truth. This will be a real test for the taxation commissioner and the department you are responsible for. This is a serious breach. Will the officer pay a penalty for it, or will it all be glossed over because they know that what they are doing in the letters that the taxation commissioner tabled today is protecting your miserable reputation, which you cannot perform in this place. You cannot answer questions.

The Commissioner of Taxation has statutorial responsibility for the administration of the taxation laws of this country. It is the responsibility of government to set the laws in the parliament and it is the responsibility of the commissioner to administer those laws. That is a statutory requirement placed on him. That is why section 130B of the Sales Tax Assessment Act&mdash;which has been the subject of the debate over the last couple of days&mdash;places the responsibility on the commissioner to publish in the newspapers within seven days details of proposed sales tax changes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Faulkner talked about it being pretty humiliating to have to say in here, `I was wrong.' Of course it is humiliating and I very much regret having to come in and say that. However, as I and the commissioner have pointed out, I acted in good faith on advice provided to me. The advice I received came from a senior officer in the Australian Taxation Office. As Senator Schacht well <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1828"> knows, when one receives advice from a senior level in the department, it is reasonable to expect that that advice reflects the view of the department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I understand it, in this instance what happened yesterday within the tax office&mdash;as the commissioner has now explained it and it is essentially contained in the letter&mdash;is that there was a legitimate difference of view within the Taxation Office as to the interpretation&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I accept the advice of Mr Carmody, the taxation commissioner, to me that there was a legitimate difference of opinion within the Taxation Office as to the interpretation of section 130B of the Sales Tax Assessment Act.

As soon as he was made aware of that&mdash;being aware of the advice that his senior officer had conveyed to me and which I then conveyed to the Senate immediately after question time&mdash;he very properly discussed the matter with us.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;May I finish my answer? As to the question of sales tax, there is a clear lack of understanding as to what the statutory requirements are for informing the public. Why does all of this happen? The answer is pretty simple: because the minister's understanding, as he has demonstrated in the Senate, stopped in 1975 when he left the Treasury. He basically went out to lunch then and stayed there. If you go back and look at all of the speeches that he has given, there is absolutely no understanding.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To this question he has given the same answer he has given to every other question. It is the same one he used in opposition and it is the same one he is using in government now. There is absolutely no variation to it. This bluster and this abusing people, which is a tactic which he has used, makes absolutely no contribution to government policy at all. He has made no contribution at all to wages policy, inflation policy, current account policy or savings policy. All we get, as we got to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this question, is the same answer he practised in opposition and which he trots out every time now he is in government. The problem for him is that he does not know the answer. He has clearly shown that he does not know the answer in these areas. Of course, the other corollary problem is that he is not in the loop. He is not consulted by the Treasurer or by the Prime Minister or by all the other people making the decisions. When he does not know, it is because nobody has bothered to consult him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This will hit the government with a big dull thud when it comes to the budget. In the budget if you don't know the work, how can you negotiate with other people? If you don't know the work, how can you go to the opposition and the minor parties and discuss what the government wants to get through the Senate?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron), to a question without notice asked by Senator Crichton&hyphen;Browne today, relating to Mr Ian Viner QC's position as a member of the Native Title Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe this to be one of the grubbiest episodes that will go down in the annuls of the Senate. It shows the level of degradation, corruption, lack of integrity and decency that is able to be portrayed by certain people for their own selfish ambitions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Viner was not the first person to go into the Justice Office and seek this unprocessed and withdrawn application. Previously, Mr Eoin Cameron's employee, Mr Gaspar, had made four applications. In fact, he got so frustrated when he was refused because he was not a party to the matter, that he demanded to see a higher person and when that was refused, he then refused the application. The very day that Mr Titelius, a known political opponent of mine, the clerk in question, ejected Mr Gaspar from Mr Cameron's office, as he had Mr Nick Nolan, a close personal friend of Mr Cameron's also&mdash;that very same day&mdash;he provided the order to Mr Viner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And that very morning, because my wife had learnt of Mr Viner disclosing private conversations, she rang him, and, on my advice, she wrote down verbatim down what he said, and what she said. And she said, `Ian, have you betrayed my trust in you as a lawyer'? And he procrastinated and she asked him the question again, and he said, `No, I have not'. Within one hour of that conversation, Mr Viner QC, on the National Native Title Committee&mdash;that's why I raise the question&mdash;went down to the court and convinced this clerk&mdash;I must say it wasn't too much to convice him&mdash;to give him the document.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The legal practitioners complaints committee thus far has sought to draw a distinction between the fact that Mr Viner, when consulted by my wife, referred her to somebody else. To me that is analogous to a woman going to a GP, being referred to a gynaecolo gist and then the GP going around and discussing the private and intimate details of the health of the patient who went to see him. In some quaint, curious way the legal practitioners board thus far&mdash;they will find themselves in court as a result of it if they do not review their position&mdash;drew that distinction. Can you honestly believe that that is the distinction that they drew?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me read very quickly from the transcript of the appeal that poor old Mr Titelius put in. Talking about Mr Viner, he said he did not have an emotional interest in it because as he was requesting the order, he told me details about the incident, not the whole incident, but he was familiar with what had gone on. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wasn't telling him something that he didn't know already.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, he was going down there using his prior knowledge. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I gave him the order and he went off, and that was the last I&mdash;I also said, because Ian Viner was sort of like a third party&mdash;</PARA>

One was sent to Senator Bob Collins, which he had the decency to return to me, without even reading it, I believe.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the document. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>This report contains some quite significant implications for the government and for potential expenditure on government buildings. It raises some serious problems that have been left over from the previous government&mdash;multimillion dollar problems. Section 9 of this report, dealing with valuations of office estates, shows the consequences of the changed arrangements&mdash;and I might say sensibly changed arrangements&mdash;under which Commonwealth departments will no longer necessarily be tied to occupancy of what might well be inappropriate government owned offices. They will have the opportunity, basically, to get the best, and in many instances the cheapest, option, which may well not be the occupancy of a government owned building.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the course of the audit by the Auditor-General into the management of the commercial estate, it was observed by the Auditor-General that the Australian Valuation Office, acting under instructions from Australian Estate Management, had revised the 1994 valuations for the government's 20 most valuable properties. The 1995 change to the 1994 valuation basis required that valuers not assume indefinite Commonwealth tenancy as they had done in 1994 but value the properties on the basis of specific tenancy commitments. On this basis an open market value which reflects net realisable value is determined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of this, there has been a massive write&hyphen;down in the value of Commonwealth properties, particularly in Canberra. Some of these involve write&hyphen;downs of well over $20 million per building. For example, the administrative building in Parkes was valued in 1994 at $53 million. Its current valuation is down by $25 million to only $28 million. We have the Campbell Park offices at Pialligo down from $67 million to $42.6 million&mdash;a $24 million cut. The Edmund Barton building in Barton is down by $11 million. The Benjamin Offices in Belconnen are down by $15 million. The Cameron Offices in Belconnen are down from a value of $65 million to only $39 million&mdash;a $26 million cut. The Jessie Street Centre in the CBD of Sydney is down by $13 million to $112 million. Casselden <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1832"> Place in Melbourne, which has been the subject of some controversy in recent times, is down from a valuation of $123.8 million to $103.9 million&mdash;down about $20 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Substantial write&hyphen;downs, not of the same dollar amount but certainly very large percentage amounts, have occurred in other buildings. For example, the George Knowles building in Barton is down from a valuation of $3.35 million in 1994 to only $700,000 as at 30 June 1995&mdash;almost an 80 per cent reduction in value. These reductions in values are obviously of some significance. I commend the Auditor-General for revealing them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The technique in valuation also incorporates a forecast of capital requirements associated with the asset as part of the valuation process. There are very substantial capital expenditures to come, as revealed in this audit report. As the audit report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 1995 review of the annual valuation of the properties highlighted a significantly lower valuation, which reflected the lack of executed tenancy agreements, and also the significant capital needs in the ACT property portfolio. The ACT values reflect a building portfolio that features many old buildings needing extensive refurbishment. In addition, valuations in a number of regions were recalculated on the basis of month by month tenancies being in place rather than a long-term tenancy agreement. This depresses property values until fixed&hyphen;term tenancy agreements are in place.</PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor&hyphen;General says that the completion of core occupancy agreements and further occupancy agreements is essential&mdash;and I underline that word&mdash;to ensure the improved certainty in the valuation process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the present government has certainly inherited some serious problems. In terms of the capital expenditure required on these buildings over the next five years, the audit report reveals that forecasted capital requirements over the next five years are `substantial'. There had been an existing capital funding requirement over this period totalling $308 million and a forecast need for additional capital amounting to $540 million after taking into account offsets and property sales proceeds. That makes a total for capital requirements of $848 million on government owned properties over the next five years.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has to find the money from somewhere. It has inherited another problem. The additional capital funding of up to $194 million will also be required to meet the forecasted shortfall in funds required to meet the Commonwealth's liability at the end of 2008 in concluding a major finance lease, which is a very complicated one that is outlined later on in this audit report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that these very expensive property commitments do raise interesting questions about how best the government's property should be handled. In fact, it raises a significant question as to whether the government really has no requirement to hold properties of this kind, whether it in fact might not be better off disposing of them so that it does not end up with the sorts of massive writing&hyphen;down of property values and massive capital commitments that are revealed in this audit report. I commend the audit report to the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not delay the Senate for too long because I know that the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Kemp) will seek to do personal injury to me if I do so. This report by the Auditor-General is one that I think the Senate should welcome. Senator Baume briefly alluded to the fact that it did come out of some actions taken by this Senate which were opposed, of course, by the then Labor government, which was most embarrassed by the performance of a number of its property operations, particularly involving Centenary House, but more lately Casseldon Place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This Senate demanded that the former Minister for Administrative Services, Frank Walker, table a range of documents in relation to the Casseldon Place building. It showed at that time that the Labor government's failed attempt to construct a building in the Melbourne business district and to fill it with Commonwealth tenants had actually lost the Australian taxpayers in excess of $100 million. This report confirms that that loss is actually more like $110 million. Senator <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1833"> Baume has said that the report shows that that write&hyphen;down of the valuation has gone up by $10 million.</PARA>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">CUSTOMS AMENDMENT BILL 1996</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Customs Amendment Bill 1996 introduces changes to Part XVA of the Customs Act 1901 in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> relation to the Tariff Concession System and to by&hyphen;laws and determinations relating to certain Policy By&hyphen;laws under sections 271 and 273 of the act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">THE TARIFF CONCESSION SYSTEM</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The changes to the Tariff Concession System stem from an evaluation conducted in 1995 which found that while the System was making concessions readily available to importers, Australian manufacturers were being adversely affected by its operation. It concluded that Tariff Concession Orders should only be made where there is no Australian manufacturer of goods substitutable for those imported.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This position was accepted by the former government, and the Tariff Concession System changes in this bill are essentially as they were announced last year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of these changes is to more closely align the operation of the System with its aim to make concessional entry readily available without adversely affecting the tariff assistance given to Australian manufacturers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will now outline the amendments contained in this bill in more detail.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most important change is the removal of the significant adverse effect clause, the so-called market test, from the core criteria. This occurs in item 4 on page 4 of the bill. In practice, the existence of the market test has meant that Tariff Concession Orders have been granted to the detriment of Australian manufacturers, contrary to the stated intention of the System. It is, in any case, very difficult for an Australian manufacturer to prove prospectively that the market for its good will be adversely affected by the duty free importation of a substitutable good.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1991, when the Industry Commission reviewed the predecessor of the current System, the Commercial Tariff Concession System, it recommended against the inclusion of a market test.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Once the market test has been removed, the remaining core criterion will be the substitutability test. The Australian Customs Service will not grant a Tariff Concession Order where it is satisfied that substitutable goods are produced in Australia. A concession will therefore only be made where there is no Australian manufacture of goods substitutable for those which are the subject of the tariff concession application.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The definition of "substitutable goods" is also qualified in item 3 on pages 3 and 4 of the bill to ensure that a de facto market test cannot be implied into this remaining provision. Without this change, the benefits of removing the market test are unlikely to be achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The system to date has placed a considerable burden on Australian manufacturers to prove that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1835"> they produce substitutable goods and that the importation of goods under the Tariff Concession Order would cause significant adverse effect to them. In future, the onus for demonstrating that there are no substitutable goods produced in Australia will rest, in the first instance, with the applicant for the Tariff Concession Order.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will be the responsibility of the tariff concession order applicant to research the existence or otherwise of Australian manufacturers of substitutable goods prior to lodgement of the application with Customs. If the application does not adequately establish that the research has been done, Customs will reject it as not meeting the requirements of the legislation. This appears in items 7 and 8 on page 5 of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The application will also have to provide the name of the importer seeking the concession. The importer's broker or agent's name only will not suffice. These details will also be Gazetted, consistent with the requirement already in existence to notify applicants of the names of Australian manufacturers claiming they produce substitutable goods. Item 9 on pages 5 and 6 of the bill refers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important that in processing applications, Customs be able to utilise the considerable knowledge of bodies such as industry associations and other prescribed organisations in determining whether substitutable goods are produced in Australia. The information contained on the application form will therefore be made available to such organisations for this purpose. Item 12 on page 7 of the bill refers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The time allowed for applicants to propose amendments to their application will be extended from 14 days to 28 days in item 10 on page 6 of the bill. Such amendments will, however, be limited to narrowing the description of the goods within the tariff classification cited in the application. The amended wording will be Gazetted, with objections allowed for up to 14 days after gazettal. If, however, Customs is not satisfied that the amended wording meets the requirements, the proposal will not be accepted and the application will be processed with its original wording as if no amendment had been suggested.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The present legislation requires the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department to provide advice on the correct tariff classification in case of error. However, in recognition that Customs is the expert agency in the area of tariff classification, Customs, rather than the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department, will in future determine the correct tariff classification. This is accommodated in items 13 and 26 on pages 7 and 9 of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I turn now to the date on which a Tariff Concession Order becomes effective. The present legislation allows the commencement date of a tariff <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> concession to be backdated to 28 days before the lodgement of the application. This is a carryover of a provision in the Commercial Tariff Concession System which was terminated in 1992. There is now no rationale for backdating Tariff Concession Orders, and items 16 to 23 on page 8 effectively remove this. Making orders operative from the date of lodgement of applications should encourage importers to lodge applications earlier.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill will also enable Customs to commence revocation action for Tariff Concession Orders where there are Australian manufacturers of substitutable goods, and where the orders have not been used for at least two years; that is, they are obsolete. Revocation of Commercial Tariff Concession Orders will also be considered under the new Tariff Concession System criteria. Items 24 and 25 on pages 8 and 9 give effect to this change.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The definition of "made to order capital equipment" will be amended to allow concessions only for equipment made on a one&hyphen;off basis to meet a specific order rather than being the subject of regular or intermittent production, and to exclude goods made as a result of production runs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Customs decisions with respect to the Tariff Concession System will remain subject to review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. However, amendments in item 31 on page 10 of the bill will limit persons who have standing to appeal to the AAT to those directly involved in the decision (that is, the applicant and those who have lodged submissions with Customs). Customs will be required to Gazette any application to the AAT. A person wishing to be joined as a party to the AAT proceedings must apply to the AAT within 60 days of the Gazettal notice or satisfy the AAT that they were not reasonably able to apply within the 60 day period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any document on which a party intends to rely at the AAT hearing must be filed with the AAT and served on the other parties not less than 28 days before the date set for hearing unless the AAT otherwise orders. In considering whether to make such an order, the AAT will consider whether there was a reasonable cause for the material not being available 28 days before the hearing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These changes should ensure that the external review process is not subject to unreasonable delay and excessive costs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed changes will also ensure in items 32 and 33 on pages 11 and 12 of the bill that tariff concession orders remain generally available by requiring the description of the goods for which the Tariff Concession Order is to apply to be generic. Where either directly or by implication an application is for goods of a particular brand name, model, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1836"> or part number, that application will now be rejected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I turn now to transitional arrangements for the Tariff Concession System which are covered in detail in Part 2 of Schedule 1 of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All applications lodged with Customs but which have not been decided on the day these changes come into effect will be decided under the present legislation, that is, the legislation in force before these amendments come into effect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, if the application is for goods which are substitutable for goods manufactured in Australia and the application is successful because of the operation of the market test, the Tariff Concession Order will be valid only up to the day that these amendments come into force. This appears in item 37 of page 13 of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Decisions referred to Customs for Internal Review or to the AAT or which are on appeal to the Federal or High Court in relation to applications for orders lodged before the commencement of these amendments, are to again be decided under the present legislation. Any orders made, however, where the market test results in a tariff concession order being granted will be taken to have been revoked from the date the changes come into effect.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Could I thank all those who participated in the debate&mdash;Senator Cook, Senator Spindler, Senator Evans, Senator Cooney, Senator Margetts and Senator Schacht. I would like to respond by making some remarks about issues raised by senators in that second reading debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, Senator Cook raised concerns expressed by industry to the Senate committee on the potential for the bill to lead to increased red tape. The government certainly does not intend this to be the case. The Senate noted Austrade, the agency responsible for the administration of the EMDG, is working with industry to ensure that this will not be the case. For example, the draft 10&hyphen;page document, which the senator referred to, would replace similar existing paperwork, which was actually nine pages, rather than be a big piece of additional paperwork.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, both Senator Spindler and Senator Margetts made comments on the grants entry test. I would like to make the following points with regard to that. Regarding some of Senator Spindler's concerns, Austrade operates an efficient counselling and referral system for exporters. The grants entry test and the registration will enhance Austrade's ability to provide these services and give Austrade a greater opportunity to support the export development of Australian companies. All grants applicants have access to those services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, this test does not alter the fundamental open access nature of the scheme. The general principles that anyone can apply, that the number of grants are not limited and that every claimant who meets the eligibility criteria receives a grant still apply. The bill will not enable Austrade as administrators to specify or limit the number of grants to be made. Decisions about whether claimants pass the test may be subject to review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Austrade is actually projecting an increase in the number of first time claimants who will receive a grant next year. Also, Senator Cook suggested that this government has not consulted with industry. I bring it to the attention of the chamber that both the previous government and Austrade consulted extensively on this bill, which has been in circulation for over 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, as noted by senators, the test itself may be disallowed by the parliament if it considers it to be inappropriate. Austrade will be developing clear and appealable rules for the tests, and this will be done in consultation <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1838"> with industry. As senators noted, discretion will be required to ensure that companies, particularly the SMEs, are not disadvantaged by rules which cannot take account of individual industry needs. The government does not agree to the opposition's amendment.</PARA>

My first question relates to the fact that at the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee's first hearing I asked Senator Brownhill a question which he may have passed on to Mr Oliver, representing Austrade, and answered by Mr Oliver at the time. That question related to the cost of administering the claims for EMDG.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1839">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The source of my inquiry was the written submission lodged with the Senate committee by the Tourism Commission.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to the administrative costs, the Tourism Commission finds it alarming that these have increased significantly&mdash;that is, around 130 per cent over the last three years from $3.3 million in 1993&hyphen;94 to $7.6 million in 1995&hyphen;96.</PARA>
<PARA>As I understand Mr Oliver's reply to my question seeking verification of the increase in administrative costs, he was not able to confirm the figures that the Tourism Council gave. I have gone back and checked with the Tourism Council and I am advised that those figures were given to a Senate estimates committee in August last year when the Department of Trade's estimates were before it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My question now is: can the parliamentary secretary confirm that increase in administrative costs? If that is not the figure, can he tell us what the figure is?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an extra administrative cost of about $2 million, but there are efficiency offsets against that, and I would imagine that those efficiency offsets will actually reduce that quite dramatically. I do not believe, Senator, that this bill has got in it the extra complexities you have alluded to.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot quibble with a belief. If you believe that, that is what you believe. What the facts are, and whether they correspond to the belief, is another matter, and we can debate that. However, I just point out that the Australian Business Chamber, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Australian Chamber of Manufactures, the Australian Book Publishers Association, the Australian Institution of Export (New South Wales) Ltd, the Australian Information Industries Association, Blades Mi&hyphen;Sporting Products Pty Ltd, the Council of Small Business Organisations, the Metal Trades Industry Association&mdash;Australia's manufacturing, engineering and construction industry association&mdash;Sunlover Cruises, the Tasmanian apple and pear growers association and the Tourism Council of Australia all believe&mdash;this is their belief&mdash;that there is extra complexity, and that was the evidence that was adduced in the hearing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1841"> So that might be your perception, Senator, but their perception is different and their perception is unanimous. We will see what the truth of the matter is if these provisions are passed&mdash;and we have given an indication that we will support them as a government measure&mdash;as to whether extra complexity arises. I would find it prudent for any organisation faced with these measures to have undertaken some sort of estimate of what the extra costs to their organisation might be. I would have thought Austrade had done that. If Austrade have found other savings, that is again a reflection on the superior administra tion of Austrade because they certainly are competent administrators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also point out, as I have said in my remarks in principle, that advice to me is that the Expenditure Review Committee of your government has demanded a 24.3 per cent cut to Austrade's running costs budget, which would diminish its running costs by a quarter. The extra efficiencies they have found will have to go to covering that gaping hole as well as meeting the demands of extra complexity imposed on them by this bill. In those circumstances, a prudent organisation should be able to at least give this parliament an answer on what the extra costs and what the extra changes in Austrade will be, and it should be able to do it for the reason that it needs to assure the Australian business community that those costs are not going to unduly delay the payment of reimbursements under this scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we heard in evidence in the committee, many companies have taken loans to cover the time gap between incurring the cost and receiving the reimbursement. If, by virtue of so-called savings in Austrade, the time between cost being incurred, reimbursement being sought and reimbursement being paid is blown out, it could well be that some companies will be adversely affected in their financial affairs. It could be that the export effort is diminished considerably as a consequence as companies act conservatively to avoid being trapped. It could also be, and very probably will be, that some companies will be financially embarrassed. Some may even go to the wall. That is the basis of my concern and the reason for my questions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point I want to ask though is, given this government's election commitment to reducing red tape and compliance costs on Australian small business by 50 per cent, can you give me any sort of guarantee that the 10-page document that Austrade is circulating for business commentary on how to meet the export ready test will, in fact, be simplified and made easy for business? By your courtesy&mdash;and I acknowledge that&mdash;Austrade made available to me, as I believe they have made available to the minor parties, a document which I think is still in draft form but which <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> consists of 10 pages. Unfortunately, I do not have it with me at the moment, but I could show it to you again. Several questions in that document go right to the heart of a company's financial security: its products and services, its administration, its marketing capability, its evaluation of its competitors and its appreciation of market conditions in foreign countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Companies are expected to fill this out in order to demonstrate compliance with export readiness, as required under this act. That stands as an extra imposition on business. For small business, with little discretionary time available to meet the demands of red tape requirements such as this, this is a further imposition. My question is from the small business perspective and on how Austrade will administer this. Can you give me a guarantee that this quite extensive requirement will be reduced and made more simple?</PARA></SPEECH>

It is more than three years late, but it has been on the agenda for three years. I was pointing out that it only goes part way to honouring the coalition government's election commitment because at the end of 1996-97, under this bill, the uplift factor reverts to 10 per cent. So all we get is one year's reduction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This contrasts with the coalition's small business policy, which says, `The provisional tax uplift factor will be reduced by two per cent to six per cent which is more in line with nominal growth in the economy.'

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are speaking on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1) and the provisional tax uplift factor. In speaking for the Labor opposition on this matter, firstly, the bill proposes to decrease the current provisional tax uplift factor from its current eight per cent to six per cent for 1996&hyphen;97 only. For subsequent years, the uplift factor will revert to 10 per cent unless parliament otherwise prescribes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Provisional tax is levied on individual taxpayers who earn $1,000 or more in investment income&mdash;interest, dividends, rental income. It does not apply to salary and wage earners, who fall under the scope of the PAYE scheme. Provisional tax is levied in order to bring forward future estimated taxation revenue from future income earnings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite often, certainly when we were in government&mdash;and I am sure while we have been in opposition&mdash;small business made significant representations about the drain on their cash flow that can occur as a consequence of the provisional tax uplift factor. They argue that it can affect their cash flow as they have to pay tax on current year earnings and then pay provisional tax on next year's estimated earnings. The provisional tax payable is based on the previous year's income being increased by the provisional tax uplift factor and then calculated at the prevailing income tax rates.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prior to the election, the then opposition, now the government, stated that the reduced rate would be of benefit to small business. I can recall on a number of occasions the now Prime Minister, John Howard, personally extolling the virtues of the now government's policy in his appeal to small business. I have here a copy of the Liberal&hyphen;National coalition's small business policy entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A new deal for small business</EMPHASIS>. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is inexcusable that the Labor Government continues to apply to provisional tax assessments a provisional tax uplift factor of 8 per cent which is in excess of growth in the economy and incomes. We will return these funds to their rightful owners&mdash;small business.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under a Liberal/National Coalition government:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the Provisional Tax Uplift Factor will be reduced by 2% to 6% which is more in line with nominal growth in the economy. This measure will have a one-off cost of $180 million.</PARA>
<PARA>That is their policy. But what do we have here in the legislation today? Any reasonable reading of the Liberal-National parties' policy would lead a person and, I am sure, the hundreds of thousands of small business persons around Australia to believe that the tax uplift factor was being reduced to six per cent&mdash;full stop. But what does this legislation do? It does not just drop it from eight per cent to six per cent. It returns it to 10 per cent after one year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a massive breach of faith in the commitment given at the last election by the new government&mdash;a massive breach of faith. It will affect 800,000 small businesses and investors around the country, who will have to pay not just a reduced uplift factor for one year. To really rub salt into the wound, it will not be lifted back up to the eight per cent, which is what it is at the present time, but to 10 per cent, which is above where we had it. It is an outrageous breach of faith. I can assure the government that there are thousands of disillusioned small business people around Australia who are appalled at the breaking of the election commitment given by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to look through some of the speeches given by now members of the government on this matter. I am going to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1845"> quote just a few of them because I think it is worth while reminding the government what their position was in opposition. Senator Short, the Assistant Treasurer,  struggling with a range of issues in his portfolio at the moment, said on 10 October 1994:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The other major item in this bill&mdash;it is a controversial one&mdash;is the reduction in the uplift factor for provisional tax from 10 per cent to only eight per cent&mdash;a relatively small reduction. That is being done at a time when inflation is being forecast by the government to be something like 2&frac14; per cent and there is an average earnings growth of about 3.5 per cent. So there is certainly a major discrepancy between the uplift factor and inflation.</PARA>
<PARA>I will return to that fact a little later. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">By reducing the uplift factor further below the limited reduction to eight per cent, the government would not lose revenue in the longer run but would delay and reduce its collection this year and therefore put more money in the hands of business and less in the hands of government. At a time when capital expenditure is important for small business, this tax slug, which takes cash out of firms' hands and puts it into the government's pocket for 12 months, will only hinder the opportunities for small business to expand.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on and on, complaining about the tax uplift factor. Senator Panizza stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would now like to address the provisional tax uplift factor. I have said time and again in this place that the provisional tax uplift factor should reflect Australia's economy, our inflation rate and those allied things that affect the sort of profit businesses will make.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on in his speech complaining, very bitterly in fact, about the provisional tax uplift factor. Senator Ferguson, who I think was on the Senate Economics References Committee&mdash;</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad you informed me of that, Senator Calvert. He was in fact chair of the committee that prepared a report on the tax treatment of small business, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A question of balance</EMPHASIS> , which refers to this issue as one of the major concerns of small business. In his contribution to that debate Senator Ferguson said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 20 October 1994, the Senate referred to the Senate Economics References Committee for inquiry and report the matter of the tax treatment of small business. This matter arose following <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> concerns about the appropriateness of the level of the provisional tax uplift factor that the government was proposing to apply to the provisional taxpayers for the 1994-95 financial year.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on and says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most complex issue that the committee had to deal with was the provisional tax uplift factor. Of all the issues raised by small business in the inquiry, it is fair to say that the uplift factor was almost universally considered unfair, not the least because most small businesses do not experience a growth in income as great as the uplift factor expects them to. This is why the committee majority recommends that the uplift factor be set at a level no higher than the current or expected annual movement in the consumer price index.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, he went on with a very significant range of complaints about the tax uplift factor. If we look at the membership of that committee we see that Senator Ferguson was the chair and there were other members of the now government&mdash;Senator Chapman, Senator Crane and Senator Panizza&mdash;altogether four members from the government. It will be very interesting to see how they vote in this Senate on the amendment that will be moved in committee by the Labor opposition on this matter. It is outrageous that a promise was given by the now government before the election&mdash;I have read out its promise on this issue&mdash;to reduce the uplift factor from eight to six per cent and then one year later the government takes it, not back up to eight per cent, which would be a breach of promise in itself, but to 10 per cent. It is no wonder small business is absolutely outraged by what the government is proposing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In pursuing our opposition in committee we will be moving that the provisional uplift factor remain at six per cent, as the coalition promised when it went to the election. By moving that amendment&mdash;I hope it is accepted by the Senate and I certainly hope to see a number of now government senators cross over this side of the chamber and vote in favour of our amendment&mdash;we will be saving, if it is carried, small business $360 million, on the government's own costings, in the 1997-98 financial year and a further $360 million in 1998-99, by the time of the next scheduled election. I hope small business, in three years time, if that is when the election is, remembers the massive breach of faith by <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1846"> the now government in this area. We will certainly be reminding them of that massive breach of faith.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If our amendment is carried it will mean an additional $540 million going back into the hands of small business as a consequence of what the Labor Party has done in opposition in this Senate. We are going to hold you to your commitment and your promise on this matter. It is outrageous. The speeches I referred to continually refer to the need for the uplift factor to be reduced to the economic growth rate, the inflation rate. All of those sorts of basic economic fundamentals have been referred to by now members of the government about where the uplift factor should be reduced to. It is not as though inflation is high. When this matter was debated two years ago, projected inflation was 2&frac14;, 2&half; per cent. Look where inflation is now. If anything, the government should be reducing the uplift factor even further below six or seven per cent on its own arguments, on its own contributions, on the record, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> in this place, in the report prepared by the Senate Economics References Committee. On its own argument it should be reducing the factor down below six per cent, but what are they going to do? This is a massive breach of an election promise made here in writing. I have read it into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Watson has just come into the chamber. The provisional uplift factor is being debated today. You should be ashamed of yourself, Senator Watson, for being in a government that promised to reduce it to six per cent. Where does it say that you are going to up it to 10 per cent after the first year? Any reasonable person reading your policy believed it was going to stay at six per cent. That is what the many small business people who have been ringing my office and ringing Gareth Evans's office, the office of the shadow Treasurer, have been saying. They are deeply disillusioned about what you have done on this proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Watson, one of the more responsible members of the government, should be sitting where Senator Short is. He could probably answer some of the questions on sales tax and the other issues we have been <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> raising with him. As one of the more responsible members of the government, I am sure you have been contacted by outraged small business people who are going to be ripped off to the tune of $540 million when this uplift factor returns to 10 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are going to defend small business in the Senate. We are going to return $540 million. I look forward to you, Senator Watson, living up to your comments on this matter when you were in opposition and crossing the floor, along with the other senators who have spoken on this matter in the last five or six years, and supporting our amendment on this proposal.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Sherry has a very short memory because in terms of the legislation the 10 per cent fallback figure has been there. I think the Labor Party introduced that concept. We are honest. We want to review it each year and, given the prevailing circumstances, if it can be lowered from the current six per cent we will certainly lower it next year with the full support of business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The hypocrisy of the people opposite is somewhat astounding. The legislation concerns three amendments that I want to address. There is reducing the provisional uplift factor, which has been very well received, contrary to the earlier remarks. There are the off-market share buybacks and the deduction for gifts. I want to confine my remarks essentially to the first two aspects, the provisional uplift factor and the off-market share buybacks. The reduction of the uplift factor on calculated provisional tax is the fulfilment of an election promise that this government gave to small business. It has been well received, contrary to earlier remarks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We went to the election on 2 March on a promise that we would reduce the uplift factor for small business. The coalition's policy document, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A new deal for small business</EMPHASIS>, released on 18 February 1996, announced that there would be a reduction in the uplift factor from eight to six per cent for the purpose of calculating the 1996-97 provisional tax, and that is exactly what the government is doing in this bill. That is 100 per cent commitment.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1847">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By contrast, the Labor Party went to the election of 1993 and said that they would not increase taxation. They were not committed to reducing it; they just promised that there would be no increase in taxes. But, as we all know, they did not even hold themselves to that. Not only did they not reduce it; they actually put up taxes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition gave the electorate a commitment, not simply to keep taxes at the same level. It gave a commitment to reduce the tax burden in relation to provisional tax, and now we are keeping that commitment. It believes in honouring promises. It is reducing the provisional tax from eight per cent set in previous years under the previous government to six per cent in the 1996-97 financial year. If no legislation was being introduced, provisional taxpayers would be paying 10 per cent under the legislation designed by the Labor Party&mdash;the default level if parliament does not provide otherwise. The coalition will not allow that default 10 per cent to operate in the 1996-97 financial year. It is delivering on its promise. It will not allow the default to operate next year either, unless the Senate intervenes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Small businesses are the backbone of our economy. The potential for job growth is greatest in the small business sector, but they need encouragement. In 1995, the number of bankruptcies in Australia increased at an alarming rate under the previous government, from 3,305 in December 1994 to 4,050 in December 1995&mdash;a 22.5 per cent increase. Businesses desperately needed to be relieved of the onerous and unfair taxation measures. The application of this bill will go some way to alleviating their plight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor's record in this field has been appalling. The uplift factor they set was quite out of proportion to any realistic measures of ability to pay or prediction of economic growth. Senate committee reports have examined this from time to time. It was just another way in which the Labor Party grabbed revenue from those making an honest living to fund the Labor Party's ill-managed government expenditure. Under Labor, the provisional uplift factor exceeded the actual rate of growth in income subject to provisional tax in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> every year between 1991 and 1994-95. The provisional uplift factor was set by the previous Labor government at eight per cent for each of the last four years, including 1994-95.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The level of aggregate income that should be subject to provisional tax can be difficult to predict. We all acknowledge that. Therefore, in regard to the uplift factor for subsequent years after the 1996-97 financial year, the new coalition government will set it when the most accurate information is available, and that is the right time to set it. It will be set at what is a realistic figure for the time and the circumstances so that small business people, self- funded retirees and other provisional taxpayers will be treated fairly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will not lock those people into situations where they may be penalised because of changing economic circumstances merely to get revenue for government but, rather, we will set a rate which is a reasonable reflection of the growth in income of provisional taxpayers. This is actually what is being done for the 1996-97 financial year. For subsequent years, an assessment of the economic circumstances will be made at the appropriate time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report on the consideration of provisions of Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1) by the Economics Legislation Committee recommends that the bill be agreed to. Unfortunately, I think the terms of reference for that particular inquiry were a little bit limited. However, all members of the committee wholeheartedly endorsed the reduction of the uplift factor from eight per cent to six per cent. The report draws attention to the fact that the amount of tax for which provisional taxpayers are finally liable will not be affected in dollar terms by the uplift factor, regardless of the amount or the form. What is at issue is the timing of the payment to the tax office. It is this aspect which can be a deterrent or an incentive for small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If provisional taxpayers think their income will not increase by the predicted uplift factor or that their taxable income will decline during the remainder of the forthcoming year, taxpayers of course can lodge an application to vary their provisional tax. A penalty, however, is incurred if that variation understates actual income by more than 15 per <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1848"> cent, unless the taxpayer can justify why his or her income was underestimated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Three submissions were received by the committee in relation to this question of the uplift factor&mdash;all of which applauded the reduction to six per cent. Concerns that it will revert to 10 per cent in the absence of parliamentary provisions otherwise naturally were expressed. What needs to be more clearly understood is that it is the government's intention to review the circumstances each year, according to the economic prevailing circumstances. The default 10 per cent may never be imposed. The intention is to review the factor in the appropriate economic climate, as was the practice of past Labor governments&mdash;it is not surprising that Senator Sherry has now left the chamber&mdash;although they seldom moved that rate, and this was the interesting factor, as reflected in the various determinants of unearned income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minority report from the Labor members of the committee condemns the 10 per cent after 1997. What they chose to ignore for their own political purposes is that the government has quite appropriately left open the option to review the factor. My Labor colleagues would have us locked in without any possibility of adjustment in the light of changing economic factors. There must be provision for more flexibility. For that reason, we will not be supporting the Labor Party amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A submission from the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants drew the committee's attention to the fact that provisional taxpayers are often reluctant to submit a provisional tax variation as the cost of doing so&mdash;doing the appropriate estimates&mdash;coupled with the 15 per cent variation tolerance allowed is a real deterrent. A submission from the Association of Independent Retirees expressed a similar psychological factor which may cause anxiety, especially amongst the elderly. It must be remembered&mdash;I think it was during the Labor Party administration&mdash;that the factor was previously 20 per cent in terms of the estimates and was reduced some time ago to 15 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants actually suggests that the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> uplift factor be linked with the economic growth factor put forward by the Treasury in its budget consideration each year. An alternative suggestion put forward by the Taxation Institute was that the factor should be automatically linked with the rate of inflation. Both of these suggestions are worthy of more serious consideration in the future deliberations on the uplift factor. The important thing is that the coalition seeks to provide flexibility and a determinant at the most appropriate time when all the circumstances are best known.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second aspect of the bill that I want to address is in relation to the off&hyphen;market share buybacks. These will apply to off&hyphen;market share buyers. The amendments are intended to deter companies from avoiding tax by arranging off&hyphen;market share buybacks. The amendment will ensure that the full buyback price of off&hyphen;market shares is treated as consideration for ordinary income tax purposes and for calculating any gain or loss on the disposal of the shares. Relief from double taxation is provided by reducing the amount of the buyback price that is a dividend included in assessable income or paid out of profits, not including revaluation reserves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the previous law tax could be reduced by the amount of the buyback that was treated as a dividend, even if the dividend was exempt or paid from an untaxed source. Companies could gain a tax advantage by buying back off&hyphen;market at a higher or lower price than the market value of the share. They could also create artificial capital losses and allowable deductions or these could be increased by rebatable dividends in certain circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed amendments that our government is putting forward will not change the calculation of that part of the purchase price of a share in an off&hyphen;market buyback that is a dividend. What will change, however, is the amount that is to be treated as disposable consideration for the purposes of calculating ordinary income or capital gain or loss. If there is a difference between the purchase price in respect of an off&hyphen;market buyback and the market value of a share at the time of the buyback, a market value rule will apply. The <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1849"> share's market value at the time of the buyback is the amount which would have been the market value of the share at the time if the buyback never occurred and was never intended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the purchase price of the share is less than the market value of the share, the difference between that price and the market value will be treated as consideration for ordinary income and capital gains purposes. It will not be treated as a dividend. This means that the taxable gain will not be artificially reduced and a tax loss will therefore not be created. If the purchase price is more than the market value of the share, the amount of the purchase price that is treated as a dividend is the amount that exceeds the sum of the paid&hyphen;up capital of the share and the amount debited to a share premium account. The dividend component of the purchase price which is attributable to the excess over the market value of the share, however, will not be frankable, no matter from where the funds used to buy back the shares are sourced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This proposal was announced by the former Labor government on 9 May 1995 as part of its 1995-96 budget. In this bill it is proposed that the closing of this loophole take effect quickly and will apply to all share buybacks that took place after 7.30 p.m. on 9 May 1995. Arrangements which were announced and which were acted on well before this date  will be exempt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that a taxation scheme does not encourage Australian investors to send their money outside Australia. This measure, amongst other things, will deter resident shareholders receiving tax exempt dividends from the off&hyphen;market buyback of shares held in a foreign company where the dividend is not paid out of profits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those on the other side have made much of a hyped&hyphen;up speculation of possible cuts to this or that government expenditure over the past few weeks. They have carefully skirted the reasons for which savings in government expenditure will have to be made. They ignore the fact that the coalition government inherited this $8 billion deficit which must be funded. Under good management, good controls and greater confidence in our ability <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to manage, that figure is now substantially less than $8 billion and will continue to fall over the next few years. The Labor mismanagement of government finances over the last 13 years means that the government is now faced with a huge debt and a huge interest bill on our borrowings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This opportunity for dodging tax should have been closed quite a number of years ago. In the Taxation Institute of Australia's submission to the Economics Legislation Committee the suggestion was made that the market value of the share at the date of the agreement under which the share buyback took place be adopted. If the market value is to be adopted, it should be set at this earlier period. I think there is some substance in the suggestion. I commend it to the minister. The institute suggested that this would avoid the unintended consequence where there is an arms&hyphen;length transaction involved in situations where the market value differs from the actual consideration provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The institute submits that the adoption of a market value in the buyback provisions should be subject to an arms&hyphen;length exclusion. A taxpayer should not be assessed on an arms&hyphen;length transaction on an amount that may never be received. If, for example, the share buyback price is set in advance under an agreement, there may be subsequent fluctuations in the market value of the shares. If the share price increases, the share buyback provisions will be automatically attracted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The institute's submission also draws attention to a problem which may arise as a result of the application of the legislation to many employee share acquisition schemes. There may be a need for specific exemption in the share buyback provisions for these schemes to avoid a situation where the employee will derive a gain on the differential between the market value at the date of the share buyback and the original acquisition price.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to the minister that both these points do have merit and I believe they should be given further consideration. They do not, however, conflict with the general thrust of this legislation, which is to close loopholes in the taxation system whereby clever companies <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1850"> and their advisers can avoid their taxation obligations by making special arrangements with regard to their off&hyphen;market buyback arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I therefore support the legislation. I seek your comments, minister, on my suggestions that were originally put forward by the tax institute. I thank the Senate for its attention.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996. This bill contains a number of measures. The one I wish to address my remarks to this afternoon is the provisional tax uplift factor. I acknowledge that the government's expert in taxation matters, Senator Watson, has just spoken, and I want to respectfully disagree with his remarks about the provisional tax uplift factor. But I am reminded, now that I have seen him take the chair, that I ought to do so in a continuing mode of respect, as, of course, I always would.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem the government has to grapple with on this subject is that, for much of the debate on this matter, the government is still exhibiting a mentality of opposition. That is to say, they are attacking the previous government and they are arguing that what we said and did in government are things that we ought to do now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an interesting point, because we do not have a mandate that was endorsed by the electorate. What we are doing in this debate is simply holding the coalition government to its mandate&mdash;which Australians everywhere think they ought to be held to and which they ought to honour. It is no good saying to us what our views were. We put our views at the election. Unfortunately for us, they did not prevail. What is expected to prevail is the coalition's views. That is what Senator Sherry's amendment is about&mdash;to ensure that the views of the coalition, presented to the electorate back in the election, are now honoured in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition, in the run-up to the election campaign, made a great deal about small business. Small business is, of course, the vital wellspring of economic growth in Australia. The advantage the coalition seized on was to simply repeat facts about small businesses as <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> if they had made new discoveries. They have not made new discoveries. We have been arguing those things all along. But in the election campaign, there is no doubt that the coalition made a feature of that and there is no doubt that we will hold them to that. There is also no doubt that many of the things they said swayed votes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note that the Bureau of Industry Economics, that body which is now going to be broadbanded into the Productivity Commission, whatever that might end up being, in its most recent industry survey for the March quarter made some interesting observations about the behaviour of the small business sector. One of the remarks&mdash;and I do not have it in  front of me, but I will paraphrase it&mdash;relates to job growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the election campaign, the now Prime Minister, Mr Howard, railed that Labor had let down small business and stunted job growth. The BIE report shows that there was massive job growth in Australia during the previous period, including the March quarter, created by small business under the Labor administration, and that all of the new jobs effectively created in the economy came from small business, which, I might say, was a Labor achievement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also points out that on current trends future investment by small business in expanding their capacity is estimated to be below the levels of what occurred during the Labor period. While it is true that the surveys of business confidence showed business and small business having high confidence&mdash;the sort of halo effect you get with a change of government&mdash;nonetheless, what they say and what they do are two important distinctions to be made here. According to the BIE survey, it is likely that investment by small business in the future will be below the levels of last year, as presently indicated. I hope that changes, but they are the facts as they stand. It does not, therefore, reflect the confident surveys that the government has been lauding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the election campaign, small business growth was to improve unemployment, to increase economic growth and to improve the current account deficit. One of the promises made by the government was to reduce the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1851"> provisional tax uplift factor. I have to say straight off that at the end of the day the full level of tax due to a small business is paid, whatever the provisional tax uplift factor. Therefore, no-one is here talking about reducing the level of taxation. We are talking about the timing of payment of the level of taxation in this respect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is important. It is important because the more you pay in provisional tax as an uplift factor, if the factor is not cast at the right level, the more money you do not have use of in your business. For small business, which is always cash strapped and always overpressed, that is an important consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has always been a consideration of mine that the best uplift factor is the factor which most accurately predicts what will be the ultimate payment in taxation, because there is a downside in having too low an uplift factor. The downside is that when the tax year ends a small business company can be visited with a requirement to pay out a large amount because they have not paid, in their tax year, sufficient in the provisional uplift. That can come as a bit of a surprise to a company. Given that small business is always teetering on the brink, it can knock some of them over the edge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have always thought that the sensible thing here is not to run in a cheer chasing mode, trying to pretend that somehow you are reducing taxation by changing the uplift factor, but to actually tell the truth about the best way to strike the most reasonable level of uplift factor. That has been the consideration that I have followed. However, as I have said, the government in the election campaign made a big feature of reducing it from eight per cent to six per cent. They were elected. This bill enacts that undertaking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does much more than that. It continues, for the outyears, to return the tax uplift factor to 10 per cent. I am absolutely certain, because small business have told me, that this is not what small business thought was being promised. When one looks at the fine print of the election undertaking, the fine print just having been recited by Senator Watson in the chamber here a moment ago, one will see that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the promise was not to reduce the uplift factor to six per cent&mdash;as is commonly understood and, in terms of media presentations on the television, radio and in the campaign literature, was said many times by responsible figures in the government, including the Prime Minister and the then shadow Treasurer&mdash;but was, in fact, to reduce it just for the 1996-97 year. The fact that that was in fact the promise, which is relied on now because of the fine print, will come as a surprise, and it has come as a surprise, to small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a recent interview, a journalist asked the Prime Minister: if there is a clash between what you have promised at the election and cost&hyphen;cutting to fill the alleged black hole, will you repudiate your election commitments in order to fill the black hole? It was a very pertinent question. The Prime Minister said, `No, we will stick by our election commitments,' in so many words.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The election commitment here is for the 1996-97 year. Our view is that that election commitment should be honoured and that the outyears ought to be a matter of calculation, and it ought to be a matter of being advised as to the appropriate level after consultation with small business so that there is a clear understanding as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Watson in his remarks referred to the coalition document <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A new deal for small business</EMPHASIS>. The coalition made a great play of saying that in the first 100 days what they would do for small business is hold a small business summit. They have held it. They held it just outside of the 100-day limit, but one would be somewhat unfair to make a significant point of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that the small business summit that was promised would be held was held, but it was really not a summit. It really was a ministerial council meeting. What it consisted of was relevant federal ministers and relevant state ministers, with some local government people along for the ride, and small business being hand&hyphen;picked and invited to make set speeches to the so-called summit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the day it was a total fizzer. It did not come down with anything that would reduce the burden of compliance costs on small business as it was mooted it would. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1852"> It did not come down with any hard changes. What it came down with at the end of the day was a decision to meet again in another year and see whether or not in the ensuing period the changes that had been lauded at election time can, in fact, be delivered. I know that there is a lot of disquiet among small business about the unhappy outcome of that summit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the other promises that the government made at election time in that new deal for small business was to cut compliance costs, that is, to reduce red tape by 50 per cent. Unfortunately for this debate right now, the immediate bill preceding this one, the EMDG bill, has been on. All of the major business organisations, including the small business organisations, gave evidence to the Senate committee inquiring into that bill that the compliance costs and red tape would  massively increase with the passage of that bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has set up a committee to look at compliance costs. What we are now getting is a promise on the never-never, in the hope that that committee will examine it and find a way through it. What we are now getting from the responsible minister is a back-pedalling and a softening of his language as to whether or not compliance costs can be reduced and as to whether or not the burden of red tape can be cut at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make the point for this debate, because small business will be watching this debate very carefully, that, whatever the level of compliance costs and red tape that the government inherited when it came to office, it has now added to them. It has now added to them with the passage of the most recent bill, the EMDG bill. That is the opinion of business. That is the opinion as adduced in the Senate committee hearing, and it is widespread.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me now turn to the provisional tax uplift factor. My colleague Senator Sherry has pointed out that, by going back to 10 per cent in the outyears after 1996-97, there will be an extra burden of $540 million imposed on small business. That is what this bill does. The government should not have done that. Senator Sherry is right to say to all the government senators in this place, who last <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> year and the year before stood up and made pretty speeches about how they were going to slash the provisional tax uplift factor, that they should cross the floor and vote for this amendment. If they do not, their words do not count for anything. In fact, their reputations are being held out to dry by the government treating them as backbenchers and as mushrooms in this case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has also been said, rightly, that the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, which conducted an inquiry into this legislation, received three submissions and that, in those submissions, the cut from eight per cent to six per went was widely&mdash;I quote the word used in the report&mdash;`applauded'. That is an accurate description of what the submissions did say.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But they also referred to the increase from six per cent to 10 per cent. In those submissions, the organisations&mdash;the Australian Society of Chartered Practising Accountants, the CPAs, the Association of Independent Retirees and the Taxation Institute Of Australia&mdash;said that they condemned the move to 10 per cent. The report itself, in reflecting the evidence before it, refers to that view as `the move was widely condemned'. That is a quote from the report. So it is not a matter of saying that we, the opposition, are saying that this is condemned; the responsible organisations that had made submissions to the inquiry have condemned it. On the basis of their condemnation, we are trying to give effect to their view and the decision of the government in the election campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason why we are is that, of course, a 10 per cent provisional tax uplift factor will fall hardest on small business. It will be a repudiation of a government claim. No amount of obfuscating will change that. No amount of saying that we are putting it in the act for machinery reasons and that we will come to it each year and deal with whether or not it should be 10 per cent or some other figure will calm the disquiet among small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will not calm it because the 10 per cent will be sitting there as a legislative fact and small business every year will have to mount its lobby to try to persuade the government <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1853"> what the reasonable level will be. So every year small business will form itself into a battalion, march on the government, knock on its door and say, `Do what you promised in the election.' That is the political dimension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The practical business level dimension is more important, which is this: what a government should do for the business community, and which is absolutely desirable in all cases, is give long and strong reliable signals to industry as to what the parameters for their activities will be. Tax is an important parameter. The government should give long, strong signals about what its tax intentions are. Industry should be able to believe them so they can then conduct their business activities within those parameters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If they want to talk to their bank manager about how much they might have available next year to take out a loan to finance business expansion, they ought to be able to know what the tax uplift factor will be. With the 10 per cent sitting there, not the six per cent, business is bound to take the 10 per cent as being the likely outcome and, as a consequence, reduce the amount of investment they might have made in expansion. If it is not 10 per cent&mdash;it could be any damn figure&mdash;they would take the conservative course and protect themselves rather than be pushed into believing it might be lower when it in fact turns out to be 10 per cent. In other words, they might invest only on the basis of 10 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government, by leaving that in this bill, is in fact sending a very bad signal to industry that the long, strong signals&mdash;the certainty&mdash;that it requires are not there. It is a variation year to year. This government is going to exercise its right to vary it. Against this background, business, in particular small business, expects the figure will be six per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make those remarks because I hope the minister at the table, the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Short), when he replies, will deal with what small business should do. Should small business, given the remarks of Senator Watson, believe 10 per cent? Should it believe it will be eight per cent? Should it think it might be six per cent?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are important questions for small business. I hope the government can answer them. In the meantime, I will vote for the six per cent. I will support Senator Sherry's amendment to make that the level because I believe absolutely that is what the government told the people of Australia and that is what the people of Australia expect the government to do.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak briefly today on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996. Before I talk about the Greens' position on this bill, I want to respond to some of the issues that were raised in Senator Cook's presentation. There is obviously a growing concern amongst small business in Australia in relation to compliance costs. But, before anyone deals with that issue, it has to be recognised that a lot of that has to do with the growing trend towards self&hyphen;assessment in taxation. It is not just a problem for small businesses, though obviously small businesses feel it as a cost comparative to their output much more than large businesses or corporations do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also a fairly major worry for many individuals. A record number of people, we are reliably told by professional tax associations, now feel compelled to employ a tax accountant to do their ordinary tax. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tax Pack</EMPHASIS> does not actually work for most people, and many of the people who do not use a tax accountant are those who cannot afford it or have no income to speak of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a growing situation in Australia where we are expecting the people who can least afford it to spend the most on assessing their tax, comparative to their wage that is. One wonders whether some study has been done of what the extra cost would be. If we provided enough staff within the tax office they could advise individuals and small business especially of their tax obligations. In that way people would not be tied up in knots of worry and concern over the threat of tax audits and somebody else saying, `It's up to you but anywhere up to, say, seven years <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1854"> down the track we can check and you have to have all the details on hand to justify whatever decisions you have made.' I know, from speaking to people in the regions of Western Australia, that that is a concern to a great many people and a great many small businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Greens (WA) have a preferred position where in time we think the whole of the tax system ought to be subject to a comprehensive review. The starting point of that review would be: what do we think tax revenue in Australia should pay for? What are we hoping to achieve from tax revenue? From there, once you have worked out your priorities you would then work out the best system to provide that tax review. We make changes bit by bit and in the end just simplifying the wording of tax legislation, which we have done in the past, does not address that; it simply makes onerous obligations of self-assessment clearer. That does not help necessarily if you are the person who is worrying about trying to do the right thing&mdash;that is, paying the correct amount of tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The actual cost to Australia would be huge, if that has ever been assessed. Perhaps the minister might enlighten us as to whether there has ever been a study. Maybe someone knows whether there has been a study of what the actual compliance cost across Australia is, whether it is increasing and how that might be mitigated, not by just lopping off taxes but by actually working out a system whereby people can be notified of what their tax obligations are instead of their having to work it out themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn now to the details of the bill. This bill contains two issues that were already included in a tax bill of the previous government: the tax deductibility of donations to certain organisations and some changes to avoid double taxation in relation to share buybacks. The first is a routine issue and the second concerns a complex area of financial dealing but does not actually address share buybacks themselves just their tax treatment. Since I have not heard of any objections or problems in relation to these areas I will not waste time speaking about them, although I may take up the issue of share buybacks at a later time.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third element is the change to the provisional tax uplift factor. Since 1991 the underlying, or default, uplift factor, as Senator Cook mentioned, has been 10 per cent. During the last three years that certainly has been too high. It is my view that, as a basic rate, it is too high. There is no reason to build in an expectation that consultancies or small service business will grow at 10 per cent per annum, especially when the economy is not growing at anything like that rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the past I have said that a fixed default rate is not the best way to go. I think it would be better to work out a formula based on indicators such as CPI or gross domestic product change, perhaps modified by some figures about the state of small business growth. With that as a default amount, the parliament could vary the rate, but it would be less likely to require legislative correction with such a method.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As it is, the default rate is high and has required downward correction each year that I have been in this place. I worry that if the rate is left where it is the status quo will be maintained. Any amendment the Senate puts to a different bill could be removed by the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have supported a lower rate in the past. We think the proper way to go is to have a rate which, while it might be low, the government can argue to raise, rather than having a rate that is almost always too high and leaving the Senate to lower it. For that reason, the Greens (WA) will support the opposition amendment to change the default rate to six per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I reiterate: in the end, we think that the tax system needs changing. The starting point should not be: what is business prepared to pay? The starting point should be: what are we hoping to achieve in various policy areas? Many groups should be involved in that decision making process. Perhaps the community should have a say as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The starting point for a new tax system should be: finding out what the important things are on which we want to spend tax; what people think is a reasonable amount of tax; and looking at the various groups which pay tax and at what relative tax contributions <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1855"> they should be making. That is a fairly novel idea. The tax reviews we have seen so far do not go anywhere near looking at the system, at what we are paying and how we are doing it. As I said, we will support the opposition amendment and, with that change, we will support this bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I start by thanking all speakers in this debate&mdash;Senator Sherry, Senator Kernot, Senator Cook, Senator Margetts and you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I will not take up too much of the Senate's time at this second reading stage. There are some items which we can take up in the committee stage. However, there are a few points I would like to take up in response to the contributions that have been made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, I reiterate that the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996 deals with three separate elements. The first element, the deduction for gifts, relates to several new deductions under the gifting provisions and the extension of one or two other gift provisions that have already been granted. There was no comment really on that one way or another from any of the speakers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second element was that of share buybacks. Again, there was little disagreement on that issue and it was not widely touched on. You, Mr Acting Deputy President, raised certain issues and I give you an assurance that we will look carefully at them. As I understand it, you raised two main issues in relation to the share buyback amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first was that the market value rules should not apply to arm's length transactions. The second was that the share buyback amendments might operate inappropriately in relation to certain employee share acquisition schemes. I will come back to you and to the Senate with a fuller response to the latter point. I assure you and the Senate that it has been carefully noted and the government will have a careful look at it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a couple of comments to make on the first issue that Senator Watson raised. Firstly, as I am sure Senator Watson would agree, it is often very difficult to determine whether parties are dealing with each other at arm's length. The market value rule is an <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> effective, objective test for determining whether parties are dealing with each other at arm's length. Secondly, irrespective of whether parties are dealing with each other at arm's length, it would not be appropriate&mdash;Senator Watson did not suggest in any way that it would be appropriate&mdash;to allow a capital loss to be created by buying back shares for less than their true value. I make those comments at this stage but undertake to give the matter fuller and more careful consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third element, and the main issue dealt with, was the provisional tax uplift factor. I will address most of my remaining remarks to that but, before doing so, I would like to pick up on Senator Margetts's point about compliance. As I understood it, Senator Margetts was talking about compliance with taxation generally. I could not agree with her more on that matter. One of the greatest problems we have with our taxation system today is the huge growth in taxation legislation that has occurred, particularly under the 13 years of Labor rule. I think I am correct in saying that during those 13 years the income tax act went from something in the order of 1,700 pages to something over 4,000 pages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation now is that the taxation system generally&mdash;and the sales tax act bears eloquent testimony to this as well&mdash;is so immense and complex that I defy anyone, even the most expert tax practitioner, to have a full comprehension of the details of the tax act and the taxation laws. They have grown like Topsy over decades now. They have been added to, layer after layer, and that is something that we believe is in major need of rectification and reform. Indeed, I or my colleague Mr Miles in the other place will be introducing legislation, if not today, then tomorrow, to take a first step along the way to the simplification of the income tax laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point is that the cost of compliance is made far too high. One of the major objectives that we have in government is to reduce the compliance costs for taxpayers generally but for small business in particular. Senator Cook, in his comments on this bill&mdash;and I will come back to some of those&mdash;cried crocodile tears for small business, as if the Labor government of which he was a senior <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1856"> member had been the champions of small business during their years in office. As small business well knows, and as I think most Australians know&mdash;I know Senator Cook does not want to listen to this, but it is true&mdash;small business suffered more grievously under the burdens imposed by the Labor government than under any government in our history. So the Labor Party should not come in here in opposition and tell us about their advocacy of small business when they all but strangled it to death&mdash;and in fact did strangle thousands and thousands of small businesses into debt, bankruptcy and insolvency during their years in office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the key issues on which the last election was fought was the question of which political party was best equipped to give small business the opportunity to breathe again, to grow again, to create more jobs, to create more income and wealth, so that the living standards of all Australians could be increased and improved after the depths to which they had sunk, particularly in the early 1990s, as a result of the most severe recession since the 1930s, which was brought on deliberately by the then Labor government. So let us not hear too much more hypocrisy from the Labor Party in relation to small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The main point that was raised by opposition speakers in the debate was the question of the uplift factor and the government's commitment to reducing the uplift factor to six per cent. There were allegations from both opposition speakers that somehow or other the coalition had broken its election promise to reduce the provisional tax uplift factor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very interesting that opposition spokesmen do not really seem to be able to get their act together on this. They do not really know what they want to say. On 22 May, the assistant to the shadow Treasurer, Mr Latham, put out a press statement, the first sentence of which claimed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Government has broken its promise to small business and self&hyphen;funded retirees to set the provisional tax uplift factor at a permanent rate of six per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>I will come back to that. On 14 June, however, Senator Cook, in one of the weakest press releases I have ever seen, said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reducing the Tax Uplift Factor is one promise the Howard Government will keep, but very sneakily.</PARA>
<PARA>So while Senator Cook was saying that we have kept the promise, the shadow spokesman in this area, Mr Latham, said two or three weeks earlier that we were breaking the promise. The opposition needs to get its act together as to what it believes on this point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that the coalition's commitment was confirmed in its policy document called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A new deal for small business</EMPHASIS> in which it gave a commitment `to reduce the provisional tax uplift factor from eight per cent to six per cent'. It was never said by the coalition during the election campaign that we would permanently reduce the rate to six per cent. What we said, and what we are committed to, is having a provisional tax uplift factor regime which sets the uplift factor each year at a level which is more in line with the nominal growth in the economy. That is our long&hyphen;term commitment. So far as our specific election commitment is concerned, the commitment was to reduce the figure from eight per cent to six per cent. That is precisely what we have done and that is precisely what this legislation is all about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under a longstanding provision of the act&mdash;and I will go through the history just briefly&mdash;there is a so&hyphen;called default rate of 10 per cent. One would think, from listening to opposition speakers in this debate, that that was either something that had not existed before today or that a 10 per cent figure was something that had been fixed by this new government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is simply not the fact. The facts of the situation are that a default rate was established in the Income Tax Assessment Act, and I think I am correct in saying that it was in 1990. That rate was set by the then Labor government, the Hawke-Keating government, and it is a default factor which has existed ever since.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it was Labor that put the 10 per cent default rate into the act. For it now to say, `Let's reduce it,' is an extraordinary act of further hypocrisy, given that the default rate has been argued over in the ensuing years. Never did the then Labor government give any indication that it was prepared to consider varying that rate.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1857">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that the rate is essentially not operative, although it was the uplift factor that was provided in the first two years of operation under a default uplift factor. The provisional uplift factor that was set in 1990-91 and 1991-92 did coincide with the default uplift factor of 10 per cent. The uplift factor was reduced in 1992-93 to eight per cent and remained at eight per cent for the ensuing four years, including the year that we are now in, 1995-96.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That figure at eight per cent was set and maintained by the then Labor government, despite the attempts by the then opposition last year, the now government, to reduce the figure to six per cent. We, then in opposition, moved an amendment in the House of Representatives last year to have the uplift factor reduced from eight per cent to six per cent, and that was thrown completely out of court by the then Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that, so far as the operation of the default factor is concerned, there is never any particular reason, or likelihood for that matter, that the default uplift factor of 10 per cent will be the figure to be adopted. It has for many years been the prerogative of the parliament to determine each year what the uplift factor will be for the ensuing year. That is why the actual uplift factor for the last five or six years has been well below the default rate. It is a rate that only applies if for some unforeseen circumstance&mdash;and it is difficult to foresee such a circumstance&mdash;the parliament was unable to set an uplift rate for the following year. It has never happened in the past, and I can see no reason why it would happen in the future. Therefore, the default rate really is in many ways an irrelevancy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But to reduce the rate, and I will say a little more on this in the committee stage, from 10 per cent to six per cent really does not seem to be a sensible way to go for any reason. In fact, it could well create more problems than it solves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So far as the six per cent uplift factor is concerned, we believe that that is a figure which is more in line with the nominal growth of the economy. So long as we continue to have, and I stress this, a provisional tax regime, we believe that the provisional tax <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> uplift factor should be&mdash;and it is always hard to judge these things in advance&mdash;closer to the nominal rate of growth of the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what we are doing. That is what we undertook to do during the election campaign. We have completely met our election commitment and, despite what Labor spokesmen may say, it is a fact that it has been very widely welcomed by small business. Small business has not fallen for this trick that the Labor Party is trying to put around that somehow or other we are going to go back to 10 per cent next year. That is a nonsense. Everyone knows that, apart perhaps from those who have been peddling it on the opposition benches.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have foreshadowed, and I will say a little more in the committee stage, we will not be supporting the opposition amendment in relation to the default factor. I do welcome the fact&mdash;and I thank all senators for this fact&mdash;that the government has decided to meet its election commitment to assist the taxpayers of Australia who are subject to provisional tax. That includes most, if not all, of the small business people of Australia&mdash;the lifeblood of the Australian economy who in many ways have been squeezed for many years now by the former Labor government in terms of having too high a tax uplift factor. We have kept faith with them, and we will continue to do so in the future. So I thank speakers again, and I commend the bill again to the house. I am glad to see that it will have its second reading passage.</PARA>

I remember all the things Senator Watson said about `blocking supply' at the time I gave my speech in the second reading debate, but I do not need to revisit all that. Let us look at why it is appropriate. Back in 1990 when this was set, inflation was running at 7.7 per cent and average earnings were rising by about seven per cent. According to Treasury, in 1996&hyphen;97 inflation will be just three per cent, which is 4.7 per cent lower than it was in 1990, and average earnings will rise by just four per cent, three per cent lower than 1990. We are now in our 19th quarter of low inflationary growth and the likelihood of Australia returning to the high inflation days of the 1980s is becoming fairly remote. Thank goodness for that! So while the 10 per cent might have been appropriate in 1990, a six per cent figure is far more appropriate in 1996.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If things change dramatically, then you can come back to the parliament and ask us to review the rate, not just keep it there for one year so that you can put out a glorious press release and then do what you want the year after.

Relying on those Treasury figures, I do not think there is any reason why the government should vote against what the opposition are proposing in this amendment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think people opposite should be reminded of the situation when Labor was actually in power. Under Labor, the provisional uplift factor exceeded the actual growth in income subject to provisional tax in every year between 1991 and 1994-95. The provisional uplift factor was set by previous Labor governments at eight per cent for each of the last four years, including 1994-95. There was no justification for such a high figure either by the government or by the Treasury officials at committee hearings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The level of aggregate income that should be subject to provisional tax can be difficult to predict. Therefore, in regard to the uplift factor, for subsequent years after 1996-97, the coalition government will set it when the most accurate information is available. What is wrong with that? It will be set at what is a realistic figure rather than at the unrealistic figures that your government set, Senator Sherry, when you had that absolute grab for money, when you used every piece of legislation available to try to bring forward the timing of the tax collections. So don't be hypocritical now in relation to what is happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are going to set the figure as accurately as possible at the time when the information is available. It is going to be set at what is going to be a realistic growth factor so that small business, which also includes self-funded retirees who are also subject to provisional uplift factors, can all be treated fairly. Of all the people under your administration, Senator Sherry, it was self-funded retirees who suffered the greatest discrimination, and these are the people who are going to get fairness and justice under our system because they will be brought into a tax regime that is equivalent to the thresholds that apply to the full pensioners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we will not lock people into a situation in which they may be penalised because of changing economic circumstances but rather set a rate which is a reasonable reflection of the growth of the income of provisional taxpayers. This is precisely what your government failed to do year after year, to your disgrace. So for the 1996-97 financial year a reasonable figure will be set in relation to the economic expectations of the time. I support the stand made by my colleague Senator Short. I reject the arguments as well as the amendment that have been put forward.</PARA></SPEECH>

He knows full well that what he has just put to the Senate is not true. He knows full well that the government, proposing the bill that we are, is not in any way saying that next year the rate will go back to 10 per cent. He knows that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1861"> absolutely full well, and small business knows it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am absolutely amazed that Senator Sherry should be prepared to deal so lightly with the truth on such an important matter as to so totally mislead the provisional taxpayers of this country, in particular small business. He professes to be a supporter of small business. I say again, as Senator Watson has&mdash;I said this in summing up the second reading debate&mdash;that if any government ever was guilty of absolutely slaughtering small business in its whole range of policies, tax and other, during its period in office, it was the Hawke&hyphen;Keating Labor governments of which Senator Sherry was a member.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Small business knows the situation. Small business knows that your government killed small business. It sent tens of thousands of small businesses broke, bankrupt, insolvent. You did it year in and year out. You did it as a result of the most incompetent government, financial and economic management that this country has seen virtually throughout its history. For you now to be coming in and parading yourself as the champion of small business is hypocrisy at its highest level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come back to the facts of the situation. In response to Senator Kernot's comments, last year it was the coalition opposition that first moved the amendment to reduce the uplift factor for 1995-96 from eight per cent to six per cent. We did it in the House of Representatives.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true that we did not press it when it came back here the second time. Do you know why we did not press it? There was the real risk that you would have finished up with an uplift factor this year of 10 per cent because the Labor government was not going to accept that amendment. To have rejected it twice would have meant that the tax uplift factor for 1995-96 would have been 10 per cent. Whilst we supported the reduction to six per cent and whilst we urged the government to do so, the fact that the then Labor government was not prepared to accept that amendment meant that the uplift factor <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> would have been 10 per cent. I am surprised that you were not aware of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to the claims by Senator Sherry that we have broken our promises in relation to the commitment to reduce the uplift factor from eight per cent to six per cent. He was not here when I spoke earlier so he may not be aware of the complete confusion within the government's own ranks on this issue. On 22 May, the shadow Assistant Treasurer, Mr Latham, put out a statement saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The federal government has broken its promise to small business and self-funded retirees to set the provisional tax uplift factor at a permanent rate of six per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>He used the word `permanent' there, which was absolutely an untruth because the coalition never said `permanent'. First of all he said that we had broken our promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He then went on later in his release to quote the coalition's statement in its policy paper `A New Deal for Small Business', which said that we promised to `reduce the provisional tax uplift factor from eight per cent to six per cent'. That seems to us precisely what we are now doing. But Senator Peter Cook just three or four weeks later&mdash;on 14 June, last week&mdash;put out a statement the first sentence of which was: `Reducing the tax uplift factor is one promise the Howard government will keep.' In other words, Senator Cook is saying that we have kept the promise. Mr Latham is apparently saying that we have not. But you all know full well that we have kept the promise because our commitment was to reduce the uplift factor from eight per cent to six per cent. That is precisely what we have done. To suggest that it is going to go back to 10 per cent next year, as Senator Sherry has done, is a total distortion of the truth. I am pleased to see that Senator Sherry has a little accepting smile on his face.</PARA>

That is our long-term undertaking. That is what we want to do and that is what we will do. That is why this year we have reduced the figure from eight per cent to six per cent. That is what everyone seems to want. The only question at issue seems to be in relation to what you do with the default rate. The proposition that you reduce the default rate now seems to us to have little if any merit because it is too far out to be able to assess the validity or the usefulness of that default rate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So you do not achieve anything at all by the measure that the opposition is proposing. For that reason we will not support the opposition amendment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I regret that there has been some misunderstanding, perhaps, in listeners' minds as a result of the sorts of issues that have been raised in the debate today. The government is delivering 100 per cent on its election commitment to reduce the uplift factor from eight to six per cent for the provisional year 1996&hyphen;97. The concept of a default provision has been around for a number of years, as the opposition well knows. I regret that Senator Kernot in her deliberations and reflections on last year's amendment was a little confused. The amendment related not to the default option but to the actual rate for the current year. My recollection was that the Democrat amendment, which had a lot of attraction, was not the default provision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate heard that Treasury officials at committee hearings were unable to actuarially support the eight per cent. It was the former government's tremendous grab for extra money and the bringing forward of the timing of taxes that were the determinants. The Keating government said that if the Senate <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> pressed the amendment the government would exercise the default option of 10 per cent. The opposition, which was the Liberal Party at the time&mdash;knowing Keating's grab for money&mdash;was not prepared to place small business at the risk of a default option of the order of 10 per cent and backed down. Senator Kernot well knows why we did not press the amendment that was moved in the House of Representatives and debated here. The Keating government said in no uncertain terms: `If you press this issue, you will have to carry the cross for the additional provisional tax that small business will have to pay.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have honoured our commitment 100 per cent. We are delivering on that commitment 100 per cent. We have said that next year and subsequent years we will set that figure annually as it applies to the next year in relation to the prevailing economic circumstances so it can realistically reflect the increase in economic activity and in taxable income and so that there is not this grab for money.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1X4">Senator WEST</NAME>
<STATE> (New South Wales)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(6.47 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to continue this evening with a topic that I had commenced this afternoon in the debate on matters of public interest&mdash;what is happening to the Australian Geological Survey Organisation. I want to go on beyond that, in the time I have tonight, to talk about some of the other attacks on regional programs and regional organisations by this government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Geological Survey Organisation, as I mentioned earlier, is a Public Service body. It underpins Australia's internationally competitive energy and mineral resources industries by maintaining a high quality geoscience knowledge and skills base. I get that definition and wording from the coalition's 1996 resources policy statement. But we now discover that they are going to have something like a 27 to 30 per cent cut in their staff numbers. We are going to be losing that skills base.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition policy states that this is the organisation that provides baseline information and related services to the mining industry and is crucial for the maintenance of an attractive regime for investment in Australian minerals and energy exploration and development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government&mdash;the same government that four or five months ago was making this statement&mdash;is in fact going against what they spoke of in their policy statement. They have obviously just forgotten the value of this organisation. We know, from media reports in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New Scientist</EMPHASIS> and in some other very reputable journals, that the industry itself is very concerned. Everybody <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1866"> in this country recognises the value of the mining and resources industry to this nation. It also has a major benefit to people in regional areas of Australia because that is where the majority of our minerals are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The maps that are provided benefit not only the mining industry but also land management. This is the government that wants to flog off one&hyphen;third of Telstra and put a billion dollars for an indefinite period into the environment because they consider it to be of concern. They want to remove the capacity of AGSO to be able to provide the mapping on which they can base land management in this country. That is absolutely ridiculous. It is a double standard. It is a false economy because the more information we have about the land and the geological make&hyphen;up of this country, the better we will be able to manage our land, the more we will know precisely where our mineral resources are and the better we will be able to assist the farming community as well to cope with things like dry land salinity caused by rising water tables.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are discovering that when water is put into some of our natural geological formations salt is leached into the surrounding countryside and surrounding areas. It becomes vitally important that we continue to know where these areas are. The more research and data we have, the better we will be able to manage our natural countryside. But this government obviously does not care about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">AGSO provides a base information line from which organisations and companies are able to go out and research. I spoke earlier today about the Newcrest mine at Cadia in the central west. Anyone who read the Sunday papers would have seen the two&hyphen;page article on this project and the benefit and value that it is going to bring to the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are other mineral deposits being discovered in other areas of central western New South Wales. I know that AGSO has also been involved in a joint project with the governments of South Australia and New South Wales in the Broken Hill area. They had a plan for a five&hyphen;year mapping program. That has been reduced to 2&half; years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Anybody who is familiar with the area of Broken Hill and with Broken Hill itself will <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> be aware that that ore body is decreasing, it is running out. We need to undertake as much research as possible to provide baseline data to encourage and to facilitate the entry of mining companies into further exploration in that area. If we do not, I think that we are going to be criminally negligent in not providing the people in that community with the possibility of further development in the mining industry for which they have the infrastructure and the skills base and for which they are rightly very proud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Broken Hill several years ago suffered a major problem when Pasminco closed one of the mining shafts because of inaccessibility and low commodity prices. We have to make sure that we do not lose the rest of Broken Hill. If you have cutting of funds to the joint project of the state and the federal governments and cutting back of the project from five years to 2&half; years, you have to realise that you will have less information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, you have to add to that the fact that the skillshares out there are being cut. They do not know what is going to happen to the CES offices. All this erosion of services and facilities in these areas will have a major impact upon these communities. I urge people to be very conscious of the impact that the reduction of funding for, and the reduction of staff numbers at, the Australian Geological Survey Organisation is going to have on people in that particular area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another thing that is under threat is the CSIRO station at Chiswick, near Armidale. This involves the CSIRO's animal production division, which has done a lot of research on, and has given support to, the merino wool industry. People are aware that the wool industry is suffering pretty tough times at present. The last thing that they need is to lose this CSIRO research facility at Chiswick.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The research facility ties in and works very closely with the cooperative development centre at the University of New England, at Armidale. There is a synergy between the two organisations. You are getting the scientists and research fellows from both organisations working together and working for the benefit of the local area and for the benefit of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1867"> primary producers and the woolgrowers in the area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the election campaign, the honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) said that he would guarantee that this particular establishment would stay open. However, on reading the local media in recent times, it has become quite apparent that he is unable to give that guarantee. He should never have given the guarantee, because he is unable to deliver the guarantee. He, like everybody else, is having to wait to see what the outcome is going to be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I noticed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Armidale Express</EMPHASIS> of the 10th of this month that he has urged community support. I would also urge the community around the area and those involved in rural production&mdash;the New South Wales Farmers Association and organisations like that&mdash;to do as he says, to get in and support the maintenance and the retention of the CSIRO establishment at Chiswick. It is vitally important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note also in an editorial from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Armidale Express</EMPHASIS> that they are also saying that it is time for `Sinkers' to get stuck in. In fact, they are calling on him to do something and to make sure that his government, the government of which he is a member, does not close this establishment. It would be to the detriment of the primary producers, to those who are involved in the research and to those who are involved in the nearby University of New England. These sorts of facilities in rural Australia are vitally important. They are just two instances of what is going to be cut by the current government.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<TITLE>Parliamentary Association for UNICEF</TITLE>
<SPEECH PAGE="1867" TIME="6.58 p.m." SPEAKER="Childs, Sen Bruce" NAMEID="IF4" ELECTORATE="NSW" PARTY="ALP" GOV="0">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IF4">Senator CHILDS</NAME>
<STATE> (New South Wales)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(6.58 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Parliamentary Association for UNICEF met today to elect office bearers for the term of the new parliament. I wish to congratulate the new president of the association, Mrs Kathy Sullivan, a Liberal member of parliament, and I wish her every success in this important role. Larry Anthony from the National Party was elected secretary of the association, and Australian Democrats Senator&hyphen;elect Lyn Allison is our new Treasurer. I <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> remain with the association in the role of vice&hyphen;president.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As is traditional, the office bearers reflect the all&hyphen;party cooperation which has always existed in the association. The Parliamentary Association for UNICEF was formed nine years ago and is a group of parliamentarians who support the aim and the work of the United Nations Children's Fund. UNICEF has a long history of providing practical assistance to women and children in the world's poorest countries and is actively involved in areas such as immunisation, literacy programs and seed loans to allow poor families to become economically self-sufficient.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Often when we see images of starving children on television, or hear the statistics of high infant mortality caused by preventable diseases, we feel helpless. The 30&hyphen;second news grab that focuses on death or disaster gives us no insight into the good work being done by agencies around the world such as UNICEF, nor do these news grabs convey the fact that not only is progress possible but is actually happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tonight I want to talk about the 1996 UNICEF report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The progress of nations</EMPHASIS>. The report was launched just last week in Sydney by Justice Marcus Einfeld. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The progress of nations</EMPHASIS> monitors the achievements of countries around the world in meeting commitments they made at the historic 1990 World Summit for Children. Countries are ranked each year according to the progress they have made in a number of areas including immunisation, poverty, malnutrition, education of girls, health services for women and maternal health.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The good news from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The progress of nations</EMPHASIS> report is that immunisation is saving the lives of three million children each year. In 1980, 20 per cent of children in the developing world were immunised. Today the figure is 80 per cent. Oral rehydration therapy&mdash;that is, the sugar and salt mixture&mdash;saves one million children's lives each year. These sachets are one of the cheapest ways possible to save human life. They cost only $1 for seven packets&mdash;seven lives saved for just $1. Yet without this basic care many children die of simple diarrhoea.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1868">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The progress made in immunisation and primary health care has occurred in less than one generation. Five million fewer children die each year from the preventable diseases. Fewer children are blinded, crippled or mentally retarded from preventable diseases such as polio.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, of course, the news is not all good. In poor countries, eight million children still die each year of preventable causes such as measles, diarrhoea, malaria, pneumonia and malnutrition. That is about the total population of New South Wales and Queensland. I must stress that these diseases are preventable. Many can be treated by simple remedies such as oral rehydration therapy, which I mentioned earlier. Others can be inoculated against. Some $75 is enough to save 200 children from blindness with vitamin A supplements, and $26 can buy blankets for 10 small children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most children who die, die of five easily treated conditions&mdash;measles, diarrhoea, malaria, pneumonia and malnutrition&mdash;and 80 per cent of children brought to health centres in developing countries are suffering from one of these five conditions. Eight million children die each year of these causes. Measles kills more people than AIDS. Respiratory infections claim more lives than cancer. Community health workers in these countries can be trained in just 11 days to save these young lives. With 14 basic drugs and referral services, these health workers can successfully meet the needs of 80 per cent of the children brought to local clinics and health centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The progress of nations</EMPHASIS> also addresses maternal death. About 600,000 women die in pregnancy and childbirth around the world each year leaving one million orphans. Many of these maternal deaths are preventable. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The progress of nations</EMPHASIS> report states that `for every woman who dies, approximately 30 more incur injuries, infections and disabilities . . . maternal mortality and morbidity . . . is the most neglected tragedy of our times'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Malnutrition continues to be a problem. Half the world's malnourished children are in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan. Some 67 per cent of Bangladeshi children are malnourished. About 700 children can be fed for $105 <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> worth of high protein biscuits, and $45 will buy a week's supply of unimix cereal for 35 children. It is obvious what just a few dollars can do, yet aid spending is at a 20&hyphen;year low. Each year since the end of the Cold War, $250 billion less has been spent on weapons yet, tragically, little of the `peace dividend' has been channelled to the world's neediest people. Aid has only increased $1 billion per year in real terms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much of the public attention given to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The progress of nations</EMPHASIS> report has focused on the issue of child poverty. Child poverty in the industrialised world varies from three per cent in the Nordic countries to 22 per cent in the United States. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The progress of nations</EMPHASIS> report says, `In all industrialised nations for which information is available, children in solo&hyphen;mother families are at greater risk of poverty.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The good news about child poverty is that government action can save children from poverty. In 11 of the 18 developed countries surveyed, government action has cut poverty in half. Currently in the United States groups such as Stand for Children are working towards cutting the child poverty rate in that country. About 10,000 concerned citizens marched on Washington calling for continued government support for welfare programs which address the needs of poor children. Children have become a political issue in Washington.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia, along with Canada and Ireland, has a child poverty rate of more than 10 per cent. In Australia, half the children living in poverty have single mothers. We must continue to address poverty in Australia and we must be ever vigilant against attacks on our society or its social welfare safety net. It is shocking that a country with as many resources and as much wealth as Australia has any child poverty. It is an indictment on all Australians that we have such a figure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not have time to develop the issue tonight but we as parliamentarians must continue in our bipartisan search for practical solutions. The future of children is too important for any cheap point scoring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, as Senator David Brownhill, who is the secretary of UNICEF, is in the chamber, I place on record my thanks for his work <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1869"> for UNICEF in the last nine years. I also thank my colleague from the Australian Democrats, Senator Robert Bell, who for quite a long period of time has had the job of being treasurer of UNICEF and has discharged that duty with great aplomb.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this debate on the adjournment I want to speak about the revised second edition of a report on human rights abuses against the people of Bougainville compiled by Marilyn Havini. Titled, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Compilation of Human Rights Abuses Against the People of Bougainville 1989 to 1996, Vol. 2</EMPHASIS>, the report is also known as `Marilyn's List'. I give notice that at the end of my contribution I will seek to table the report. It has been shown to all parties in the Senate and agreement for tabling has been obtained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report has some 55 pages of incidents, including people being killed, tortured, wounded and raped. It is a horrendous report. It is one that we should take note of, seeing that the incidents it describes have occurred in our region. We must take every action that we can to reduce these horrible crimes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can do no better than to read into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> the foreword written by Dr John Ward, the New South Wales co&hyphen;ordinator of the Medical Association for the Prevention of War. It runs as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the near north of Australia lie three of the world's many conflict&hyphen;ridden countries&mdash;Bougainville, East Timor and West Papua. They contain some of the most spectacular beauty and most productive land in the world and should be areas of peace, culture and sustainability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not a coincidence that each contains a resource in great demand in the affluent world&mdash;copper in Bougainville; gold in West Papua; oil in the Timor <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Gap. The rapaciousness of the mining companies and the colonial governments which support them, including militarily, leaves no room for the limited aspirations of the indigenous peoples.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Attempts by the indigenous peoples to protect their environment and culture and to benefit from the resource exploitation of their land have resulted in violent repression. This has been most brutal and calculated in East Timor where approximately 20 per cent of the population have been killed by the Indonesian military forces over the past two decades.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Bougainville, the killings clearly number thousands but, in addition, the surviving population is forced to live in the most difficult circumstances. Normal food production is sabotaged, resulting in starvation and undernourishment. Health services are almost non&hyphen;existent with no doctors, few nurses and virtually no medicines. Many people have been forced away from their villages into the more sheltered mountains, often living in caves. Unfortunately, among the many international trouble spots, Bougainville is of little strategic importance to the major global powers and rates little attention in international fora. The undisciplined PNG military forces are allowed to perpetrate their crimes with little international condemnation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Marilyn Havini is one of a number of brave, dedicated individuals who work tirelessly to call the attention of the world to the tragic situation in Bougainville. Her documentation of human rights abuses in Bougainville has been an invaluable resource for politicians, negotiators and activists for the present and, hopefully, a record for addressing justice issues in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australians, in particular, cannot turn a blind eye to the tragedy of Bougainville. Apart from its proximity, Australia is the country with the closest ties to PNG and its major military ally. We provide military advisors and equipment which have, undoubtedly, contributed to the skills and resources of PNG forces in Bougainville. The use of Australian&hyphen;made Iroquois helicopters as gun ships and for the disposal of bodies at sea is the most infamous example of our complicity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is hard to understand how we have allowed this previously beautiful, abundant, peaceful country to be reduced to terror, impoverishment and disease. It is only possible while we maintain the delusion that Bougainvilleans are, some how, different and less human than ourselves.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The real truth is that it is the perpetrators of this tragedy, and the people who stand aside and allow it to continue who are less than human, not the unfortunate victims. Even less human is the system of greed and overconsumption that places more importance on resources than people. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1870"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I hope that the production of this second volume of Marilyn's list jolts the world out of its apathy and forces the PNG Government to seek a peaceful resolution of the conflict. The people of Bougainville have suffered too much and must be allowed to return to their villages, families and peace.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we cannot resolve this conflict, it augurs poorly for the next century when countries will be disputing over scarce resources such as water and energy. The future of humanity is bleak unless we face the true nature of the behaviour which lies just below our thin veneer of morality.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that those words are a fitting foreword to this report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I wish to acknowledge the work of Senator Christabel Chamarette on this issue. Senator Chamarette tabled the first edition of this work and I know she remains strongly supportive of the campaign for peace pursued so relentlessly and at great personal sacrifice by Marilyn and Moses Havini and their colleagues. I commend the document to the Senate and seek leave to table it.</PARA>

<STATE> (Queensland)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(7.16 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I come to the chamber tonight to discuss a matter which I have discussed on previous occasions, and that is the collapse of the Aust&hyphen;Home Investments scheme which ran in Queensland some years ago, and which was the subject of investigation by the Australian Securities Commission. The comments I am making in this place tonight I am making here for one reason, which is that I cannot make these comments outside this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been forced to come into the chamber to make these comments because of the number of people who have written to me asking me my opinion of the conduct of the promoters of the scheme. I would have liked to be able to write to those people personally but I cannot do that because, if I do write to those people personally in reply, I could be guilty of defamation because, in the state of Queensland, truth is not a defence to an action of defamation. I want all honourable senators to know why I have gone to this step to do this tonight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> What I intend to do is not give a detailed history of the collapse of Aust&hyphen;Home Invest ments and its investigation, but rather give a potted history and pick up the essential problems that existed with this group, with the investigation, and highlight to honourable senators the fact that the people who were behind this scheme are now promoting a similar scheme in New South Wales, aimed at ripping off innocent investors in the coalfields of the Hunter Valley.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Aust&hyphen;Home Investments scheme arose out of something called the Queensland growth investment scheme, which was an incorporated association which was used by the promoters to encourage people to make contributions to a scheme and seek a tax deduction. It was supposed to be a negatively geared scheme so that people notionally borrowed from a finance company money that was then lent to another company within the group. It was a non-recourse loan and they claimed a deduction in their tax liability for the interest servicing costs. That scheme was closed down. The promoters then rolled it over into a group of companies collectively known as the Aust&hyphen;Home Investments scheme. There were a number of companies in this scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In many cases, people claimed tax deduction on the basis of an interest liability which they met. They never actually put up the principal sum that was notionally borrowed, but they did pay the interest and they paid the interest through deductions from their wages. Many of the people who were inveigled into this scheme were coalminers in central Queensland. Other people were dragged into the scheme because the promoters had infiltrated the charismatic churches in Brisbane. Most of the investors, as I said, put up their money because they paid interest on notional loans from the finance company that were on&hyphen;lent into the investment company. Some unfortunate investors actually parted with sums of money that were principal, that were capital, as well as paying interest on notional loans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The promoters came under investigation by the Australian Securities Commission and the investors were also subject to investigation by the Australian Taxation Office. I have discussed this matter in some detail before. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1871"> Suffice it to say the investigation by the Australian Securities Commission was seriously flawed. It led to a Senate inquiry and that Senate inquiry by the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee found substantial failings in the investigative conduct of the Australian Securities Commission. The Australian Securities Commission has amended its conduct in many ways, but not all of the recommendations of the Senate committee were picked up by the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The promoters of that scheme have infiltrated the fighting fund that was set up by the investors when the scheme collapsed. The fighting fund was set up for one purpose: to represent the investors against attempts by the Australian Taxation Office to make the investors liable for penalties, as though the investors knew that the scheme in which they had put their money was a fake.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth is that investors did not know. They honestly believed that there were millions of dollars of investments. The truth was that there were not millions of dollars in investments and the money that those investors paid, which was notionally interest, was skimmed off by the promoters and used for their own purposes. It was a dreadful abuse of those people's trust. So a fighting fund was set up. Through efforts that I had made and through efforts of the fighting fund, an agreement was reached with the Australian Taxation Office that eliminated many of those penalties. Many of the investors were still liable for substantial sums of money to the Taxation Office&mdash;but not the penalties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The promoters have infiltrated that fighting fund and are using it to promote the view that there was nothing wrong with Aust&hyphen;Home Investments. Nothing could be further from the truth. This scheme was a sham and the intent of the promoters was fraudulent. The promoters, however, have used the fighting fund and the resources of the fighting fund to tell the investors that there was nothing wrong with the scheme because the promoters were never charged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to tell the Senate the reason why the promoters were never charged. It is because the Australian Securities Commission bungled the investigation, and all of the evidence that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> was obtained was obtained under derivative immunity. In other words, they got the evidence because the directors produced information or confessed to certain things. But, because of the derivative immunity rule that existed in the Corporations Law at the time, that evidence could not be used in a court of law to prosecute those men.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the only reason why the promoters of this scheme were not prosecuted. It is not because they were innocent; it is because the investigation was bungled. That is why I said in the Senate last year that the scheme was essentially fraudulent, not that the investors had a fraudulent intent. In fact, the investors were the victims. The intent of the promoters was fraudulent. I hope that sets the record straight for the investors who have been writing to me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now let me move on. One of those promoters, a Mr Trevor Bell, is an undischarged bankrupt as a result of his involvement in the scheme. However, in spite of being an undischarged bankrupt, Mr Bell directs the operations of a similar fraudulent scheme in New South Wales in the Hunter Valley called the Pioneers Trust. He uses the same modus operandi, which is to infiltrate the coalmines and get the coalminers and their families to pay up money which is, theoretically, interest on notional loans which, as far as I can see, do not exist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He has told the investors in New South Wales, `Do not provide any information to the Australian Securities Commission because they will victimise you.' He has used the unfortunate experience of investors in Queensland, who suffered as a result of a bungled ASC investigation the first time round, to keep those investors from disclosing what they know to the Australian Securities Commission. I understand that Mr Bell is still an undischarged bankrupt and is likely to remain an undischarged bankrupt for a long period of time because of his conduct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also, of course, an offence under the Bankruptcy Act to be involved in the promotion, formation or management of a company&mdash;and a company, I understand, is involved in this trust&mdash;even if you are not a director, whilst being an undischarged bankrupt. I <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1872"> also believe that the nature of the fund, which he controls through telling the trustees what to do, is fraudulent and is just as flawed as the Aust&hyphen;Home scheme. If it is ultimately exploded by the Australian Securities Commission or the ATO, it could lead to substantial tax liabilities on investors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge any investor who has any information about the Pioneers Trust to make that information available to the Australian Securities Commission as a matter of urgency. I also urge them to be extremely wary of Mr Bell. His conduct has left many people substantially worse off. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this adjournment debate to refer to drought exceptional circumstances in the Upper Hunter. The Senate will recall on many occasions through 1994 and 1995 that I pointed out repeatedly the failure of the former Labor government to address this matter. But it was too little too late. It was almost the end of the drought before they finally gave any assistance at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the other place the other night, the member for Hunter, Joel Fitzgibbon, took to revising history on this matter. I think he largely did this to square&hyphen;off some of his father's failings in this area when he was the member for Hunter. The minister for primary industries has revoked some areas for exceptional circumstances drought, and the rural lands protection board in the Upper Hunter has taken off the areas of Denman, Singleton and Scone but left in Merriwa parts A, B and C.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Joel Fitzgibbon used this adjustment to the coverage of the scheme to evoke unnecessary fear amongst farmers in the Upper Hunter. The speech was a dishonest presentation only telling half the truth. The reality is that Merriwa does stay in under exceptional circumstances. For the other areas&mdash;and this is the important point&mdash;Commonwealth assistance for eligible farmers will remain for the following six months. This includes drought relief payment for living expenses, interest subsidies of up to 100 per cent and Austudy benefits by the exclusion of on&hyphen;farm assets <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> from the assets test. The Howard government is providing these benefits to Upper Hunter farmers for a further six months and aid to Merriwa indefinitely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We recognise that drought recovery is not instantaneous, and our government has set up a special rural task force, announced by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman), to address ongoing assistance to farmers when household support ends. What the member for Hunter has said is misleading, and it has created unnecessary anxiety for farmers in the Upper Hunter.</PARA>

<ANSWER PAGE="1873" SPEAKER="Vanstone, Sen Amanda" NAMEID="7E4" ELECTORATE="SA" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator Vanstone</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The majority of recruitment agents for overseas students operate offshore and are therefore <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1874"> outside the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth. For this reason, direct enforcement by any Australian agency of Australian licensing or accreditation requirements presents significant legal and practical difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment and Youth Affairs (MCEETYA) has developed a Code of Practice (the MCEETYA Code) for the provision of international education and training services by Australian institutions. The MCEETYA Code specifically requires providers to be responsible for the actions of their appointed agents in relation to the marketing of services to, and the application processes for, overseas students and to make every reasonable effort to ensure that at all times these agents act in the best interests of the applicant and the provider.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The MCEETYA Code is given the force of law in some States and Territories, where compliance with it is explicitly required by State or Territory legislation. The Code is further supported by section 12 of the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulations) Act 1991 (ESOS Act) which requires providers of courses to overseas students not to engage in misleading or deceptive conduct in connection with the recruitment of intending overseas students. In addition, section 6A of the ESOS Act (1991) holds private providers responsible for the pre-paid student fees from the time they are received directly by a provider or their agent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would be inappropriate for this regulatory function to be undertaken by the Australian International Education Foundation (AIEF). The role of the AIEF is to position Australia as a respected and influential partner in the international education, research and training community. It is an industry/government partnership with a key objective being the promotion and marketing of members' products and services to prospective overseas students. In fulfilling this objective the AIEF is developing specific programs to support off-shore agents who act on behalf of members by providing them with timely advice and information on policy and procedures related to study in Australia, enhancing their understanding of Australian education and training systems, and providing them with up to date information and materials on study in Australia.  <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Particular activities being undertaken by my Department's Education Counsellors based in Australian Diplomatic Missions in key markets is to support agents representing Australian institutions, including the development of a code of ethical practice for education recruitment agents, conducting agents' fora to provide information on Australia's international education policies and practices, and facilitating the agents understanding of, and commitment to, ensuring that only bona fide students who meet all Australian visa requirements apply for visas to study in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although the AIEF does not act as a regulatory body it does provide an effective forum for the industry to make known views on those measures which will provide best support for the long term growth and integrity of the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The MCEETYA Code informs State/Territory legislation and administrative procedures for approving providers of services to overseas students who are then placed on the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students (CRICOS). It also forms the basis of sector specific codes of practice in the provision of services to overseas students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sector specific codes of practice have been developed by peak industry organisations including: the Australian Vice Chancellors' Committee (AVCC); Australian TAFE International (ATI); the English Language Intensive Courses for Overseas Students Association (ELICOS Association); and the Australian Council of Providers of Education and Training (ACPET).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">These codes of practice seek to promote the development and maintenance within each sector of high standards of education and support services to overseas students. Sectoral codes of practice typically encompass activities involved in the marketing of sectoral products and services, selection and enrolment of overseas students and the provision of appropriate support services such as "International Student Contact Officers" to provide counselling and advisory services to overseas students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the private sector of the industry codes of practice complement the Tuition Assurance Schemes (TASs) which operate under the ESOS Act (1991). Each provider offering courses to overseas students must be a member of a TAS or have in place an alternative prescribed arrangement to protect students' fees. A TAS ensures that students will be provided their tuition by another member of the TAS should the original provider be unable to provide their course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3a) Australian institutions, including universities, generally utilise the services of overseas based agents to recruit students for their courses. These agents may charge a fee for a package of services <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1875"> to facilitate a students' application to an Australian institution. In this respect, agents are authorised by the Australian institution for which they recruit students. These institutions are bound by codes of practice, derived from the MCEETYA code of practice, which articulates the institution's responsibilities in selecting and dealing with agents. These responsibilities are given legal effect through the ESOS Act (1991) which, directly and through implication, requires providers to be responsible for the actions of their appointed agents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those intending overseas students who choose to do so may apply directly to the institution of their choice. For example, the Universities Admission Centre provides a mechanism whereby students are able to apply directly to a participating institution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3b) As stated above, education and training providers are responsible for the actions of their agents in the recruitment of intending overseas students. In order to support providers in ensuring that their agents are meeting "best practice" standards in the delivery of their services the AIEF is working with agents nominated by its members to improve the quality of their services. Additionally, the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (DIMA) is developing a program whereby selected reputable agents in major student source countries offshore will be offered a "preferred agent" protocol. The agents, who have demonstrated a commitment to ethical practices in preparing bona fide student visa applications, receive a competitive advantage by being authorised to issue visas directly to students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3c) Overseas students in Australia are free to transfer from one institution to another provided they maintain the conditions of their student visa. A provider's registration on CRICOS may be cancelled if a provider, directly or through their agent, has engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct in connection with the recruitment of an intending overseas student.

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator Vanstone</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Student and staff data are collected on a calendar/academic year basis, not a financial year basis. Presentation of data as student&hyphen;staff ratios, and not staff&hyphen;student ratios as requested by the Senator, is standard within the higher education sector. Student&hyphen;staff ratios are defined as the ratio of student load, excluding industrial experience load, in EFTSU (equivalent full&hyphen;time student units), to academic staff with teaching only and teaching&hyphen;and&hyphen;research functions, in FTE (full&hyphen;time equivalence). 1995 casual staff data are not yet available <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1877"> so two sets of ratios are reported. The first set, for 1994, includes casual staff data, the second, for 1994 and 1995, excludes casual staff. The student&hyphen;staff ratio for the `G8' universities in 1994 (including casual staff) was 14.3, and for 1994 and 1995 excluding casual staff 16.6 and 16.8, respectively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) For the remaining universities the student&hyphen;staff ratio for 1994 including casual staff was 15.9, and excluding casual staff 19.0 and 19.8 for 1994 and 1995, respectively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) State student&hyphen;staff ratios in 1994 including casual staff were as follows: New South Wales 15.6; Victoria 15.2; Queensland 15.8; Western Australia 15.7; South Australia 13.9; Tasmania 14.8; Northern Territory 12.1; Australian Capital Territory 15.6; and Australia 15.3. Student&hyphen;staff ratios excluding casual staff in 1994 were: New South Wales 18.3; Victoria 18.2; Queensland 19.1; Western Australia 19.0; South Australia 15.7; Tasmania 16.0; Northern Territory 15.3; Australian Capital Territory 19.1; and Australia 18.1. 1995 Student&hyphen;staff ratios excluding casual staff were: New South Wales 18.6; Victoria 18.7; Queensland 19.5; Western Australia 19.4; South Australia 17.0; Tasmania 18.4; Northern Territory 16.1; the Australian Capital Territory 18.6; and Australia 18.5. Differences in ratios between States may reflect the nature of the universities in each State. For example, universities with higher postgraduate loads will have lower student&hyphen;staff ratios. The pre&hyphen;1988 universities, in particular the `G8', have long established postgraduate programs. Thus States with proportionately more students at pre&hyphen;1988 or `G8' universities will generally have a lower student&hyphen; <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> staff ratio than States with higher proportions attending post&hyphen;1988 universities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) There is no straightforward comparison between `former Colleges of Advanced Education' and other universities, because many of the pre&hyphen;1988 universities absorbed Colleges of Advanced Education. However, we can compare pre&hyphen;1988 universities with post&hyphen;1988 universities. The student&hyphen;staff ratio in 1994 for the post&hyphen;1988 universities (including casual staff) (16.1) is higher than that for the pre&hyphen;1988 universities (G8&mdash;14.3, others 15.6). The ratios for each category, excluding casual staff, in 1994 were 16.6 for the `G8' universities, 18.1 for the remaining pre&hyphen;1988 universities and 19.9 for the post&hyphen;1988 universities. In 1995 the ratios increased for each category of university to 16.8 for the `G8', 18.8 for other pre&hyphen;1988 universities and 20.7 for post&hyphen;1988 universities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) The OECD publication which lists details of the education systems of OECD countries is `Education at a Glance'. The most recent release lists 1993 data but does not report student&hyphen;staff ratios.</PARA>
