<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to Senator Hill, the Leader of the Government in the Senate representing the Prime Minister. In answer to a number of questions last Thursday, you described Senator Short's failure to comply with the Prime Minister's code of conduct `as a side issue'. You refused to acknowledge there was any conflict of interest involved and you said that you `did not regret anything in relation to this matter'. Minister, having now had some time to reflect on this issue, do you accept that this is in fact a very serious matter, that both <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Senator Short and Senator Gibson clearly breached the Prime Minister's guidelines and that the opposition and the Australian people are entitled to regard such breaches as unacceptable?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I referred to `a side issue' because I must say that I was more concerned with issues of unemployment, debt and disadvantage&mdash;the big issues that are facing Australia at the moment, and the issues that we inherited and are seeking to do something about. Yes, ministerial standards are important. I might say in passing that Senator Short is an honourable and decent person who inadvertently breached the guidelines. Furthermore, when he discovered that he had given a ministerial approval that might be seen to be in conflict with that, he offered his resignation to the Prime Minister. That was accepted and he has resigned. He has therefore paid a very high price for the ministerial standards that have been set by the Prime Minister. That really ends the matter.</PARA></TALK.START></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for the Environment. Last week you informed the Senate, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Minister,  of the establishment of an inquiry to examine solutions to Australia's growing urban air pollution problem. The community is not only increasingly concerned about air pollution; it is also concerned about other emissions into our environment. The public rightly believes that it has a right to know what substances are being emitted into the environment. Can you inform the Senate of what steps the government intends to take to ensure the public has access to information about pollutants?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="4063" SPEAKER="Hill, Sen Robert" NAMEID="BH4" ELECTORATE="SA" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Environment" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can inform the Senate that the federal government has today taken a major step towards the establishment of a national pollutant inventory. Senator Patterson is correct to say that this is an issue of extreme importance to the public. Since assuming this responsibility for the environment portfolio, my office has had as much correspondence on the issue of air pollution and the solutions to air pollution as on any other environmental issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The national pollutant inventory will be an important step in guaranteeing the public's right to know what substances are being emitted into the environment. The inventory will provide publicly available annual summaries of hazardous chemicals released into the environment from nominated sources. The data is supplied by those who release substances into the air, land or water, including industry and other relevant government authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can inform the Senate that cabinet today has given the green light to a draft proposal for a national pollutant inventory, which will form the basis of negotiation with the states and territories under the National Environment Protection Council. When the council met for the first time in Perth earlier this year, we were able to gain the support of the states and territories for the NPI to be pursued by the Commonwealth as a measure under the NEPC proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although the previous government invested some $6 million of taxpayers' money into the development of an NPI, it was not even able to get up a first meeting of the NEPC let alone progress it further. We will now be able to take to the next meeting of the NEPC, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4064"> which is to be held in late November in Brisbane, a draft of a measure which we hope will then be endorsed by the NEPC. It will come back for final approval and, hopefully, within the not too distant future will be put in place and therefore the Australian public will have the right to know the legislative basis which is the equivalent of that which has already been provided in many other developed countries.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5K4">Senator FAULKNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is again directed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Hill. Are you aware that on 17 May the Prime Minister assured the House of Representatives that the guidelines that were laid down in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Guide on Key Elements of Ministerial Responsibility</EMPHASIS>  would be complied with in full? Is it not true that in the five months since that assurance was given the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has been exposed as being in breach of the guidelines, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs has been exposed as being in breach of the guidelines and, most recently, the former Assistant Treasurer and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer have been similarly exposed? Is the Prime Minister unable or just plain unwilling to enforce these guidelines?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true that the guidelines set a very high standard and we do not apologise for that. We believe that the Australian people are entitled to that. The Prime Minister has said that ministers are expected to keep those guidelines. As a result of the breach that just occurred of those guidelines, even though there is no suggestion there was any intention of personal benefit that would flow from that breach, a minister has paid a very high price&mdash;the highest price a minister could pay. I would have thought that that is the proof that this government intends to maintain high standards of ministerial conduct. Perhaps, as one of my colleagues said, you ought to look at your own book, at your own record before you come in here criticising others.</PARA></TALK.START></ANSWER>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VJ4">Senator WATSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator Alston. In a weekend news article the minister is quoted as supporting the retention of Australia Post in public ownership, which I support. In that article you were quoted as saying:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is not obsessed with the privatisation of public enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA>You further went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In each case, the individual circumstances and market environment need to be considered to determine what ownership structure best serves the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA>Can you advise the Senate whether these are accurate statements?</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4065"></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="4065" SPEAKER="Alston, Sen Richard" NAMEID="LD4" ELECTORATE="VIC" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Communications and the Arts" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, that was an accurate report and a statement that needed to be made in terms of the approach that governments should take to privatisation. Australia Post has made very substantial productivity gains and provided enhanced services to its customers since it was corporatised in 1989. If one looks at the statistics since that time, one finds that profits are up from $45 million to $344 million, dividends to government are up to $143 million, employee numbers are down about 3&half; thousand, industrial action is from 7,150 days to 70 days and labour productivity is up 32 per cent against a national gain of 13.4 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It ought to be clear that Australia Post is performing very well by any standard. Labor, in government, said back in 1993 that there is no reason why you should not continue to review and assess the performance of government business enterprises and see whether they can do better. In a press release on 15 November, Mr Beddall said that the government would be monitoring changes closely and would conduct a further review in 1996-97, which was consistent with his government's view that a public monopoly must justify the continuation of its monopoly position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some 55 per cent of Australia Post's revenue still comes from reserve services. It is therefore appropriate that there should be a review by the National Competition Council to consider the remaining limits on competition in the postal services market. The reason for that is that it is simply in the best interests of consumers to see whether Australia Post could do even better or others might be able to do even better by delivering better quality services and lower priced postal services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why it is very disappointing to find that, against the background of Labor taking the high moral ground on this issue in government, in opposition they have simply reverted to type. Mr Crean had the temerity to suggest that that general approach was one which the opposition was prepared to support if continued services to rural and remote areas were guaranteed&mdash;a respectable position to take&mdash;but it is completely at odds with the neanderthal approach taken by Senator <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Schacht on this issue. He simply dashed off a press release saying that the opposition has declared that it was not interested in supporting any changes to the present operating rules and regulations of Australia Post.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How much more head in the sand can you get? If that is not blind opposition, I do not know what is. You have not been prepared to look at the outcome of a review before you say no. If that is not simply ideological nonsense at its highest, I do not know what is. I would have thought that, at the very least, the opposition now would be trying to stake out some policy alternatives, to get some policy coherence back into the debate, not simply to be negative. What we have here is negativism raised to an art form. It is very disappointing that that seems to be the attitude.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can understand why Senator Kernot was reported a week or so back as saying that it is hard for Labor to sound credible on the partial sale of Telstra when you sold the Commonwealth Bank. You remember, of course, that Mr Beazley was the one who, at one stage, was asked in caucus how Labor would explain to the masses that they were opposed to the privatisation of Telstra when they had privatised everything else. Mr Beazley told Bob Brown, `Don't worry, son, just get out there and tell them the opposition's going to privatise Australia Post as well.' That is about the depth to which they have sunk. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> last Saturday, Mr Beazley was asked about opposing the sale:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Would a Beazley government oppose further privatisation? `There isn't anything left to privatise,' Mr Beazley chuckled wryly.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose we will learn in the supplementary question the source of the quote. The answer of course is that this government is intent on reinvesting a large sum of money in the natural capital of Australia. The time for that is overdue. Through ignorance, in particular, we as a nation have done enormous damage to our natural environment. We have failed to appreciate how fragile it is. We adopted European farming practices, for example, without understanding fully how they would affect our streams and our soils. As a result of that, there is now very severe degradation, salinity and rising water tables&mdash;a lot of major damage that is going to take a very large sum of money to remedy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government, of course, needs to obtain that sum of money. There are only two real sources. For the former government, it would have been to borrow more. They borrowed literally billions more than they raised. I guess you borrow or you tax more, or you sell an asset and reinvest part of the capital proceeds of that asset in this particular task. That is what we have chosen to do&mdash;a very legitimate policy decision to sell one-third of Telstra, a telecommunications company, and to reinvest $1 billion of the proceeds of that sale in our <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4071"> natural environment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is significant that we have to rely on coalition questions on matters of great importance to Australia. My recent visit to Korea followed very hard on the heels of the APEC minister's meeting in Sydney. The forecasts at the APEC minister's meeting were that economic growth in APEC would be substantially higher than in the OECD countries. In fact it is envisaged that the APEC region will be the focus of global growth over the next 10 or 15 years. Hand in glove with economic growth is a forecast of some $2 trillion required for energy infrastructure within APEC. This will present enormous opportunities and challenges for APEC and Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Korea and Japan I met with government ministers, power utilities, gas companies, steel mills, major trading companies and Australian business interests. What came out of those meetings was great news for Australia. There are enormous opportunities, not just in the supply of energy materials but for more value adding in Australia and the sale of technologies and equipment into the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In view of the projected growth and thus demand in the region, the major concern of all those people was security of supply. While reliability of supply was raised, it was security of supply which was predominant. What was said to me on a number of occasions was that long-term relationships should be given preference to newcomers; in fact, the term used was `Latecomers should be treated as newcomers'. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I expressed the view that, while Australian companies valued the long&hyphen;term relationship, it was up to them to decide on capital investments and markets and the role of government was to facilitate the process. What this means for Australian companies has been a major change. Whereas, in the past, Australian companies with the support of the then government sought foreign equity to participate in Australian companies to secure markets, we now have foreign companies seeking equity to ensure security of supply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From an energy perspective, the countries continue to diversify their energy feed stocks so that there are roughly equal demands for gas, coal and uranium. They also tend to diversify between countries and within countries, and this is simply a reflection of the fact that they have very few indigenous supplies of energy materials.

The government will be consulting with interested parties regarding appropriate regulatory frameworks for the regulation of privacy issues in the non&hyphen;government sector.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the benefit of senators not familiar with the privacy principles, one of them in particular states that where personal information is collected for the individual concerned that person should be aware of the purpose for which the information is being collected. So while I was looking at the Democrat home page I was particularly interested to see the way in which it invites Internet users or surfers to become involved in a number of topical, political issues, including: gun control, ABC funding, higher education funding and Austudy?</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I did. In the case of guns and the ABC, Internet surfers are invited to print off a petition and gather signatures. I am pleased that you are interested in this, Senator Kernot, because other people will be interested in what you have to say about it. Alternatively, the Internet users can enter their personal details into the form provided on the screen and click on a `submit entry' button. They are told: `Your submission will be added to the growing list'. This clearly implies that a person will have their name added to a petition or a list of protesters being compiled somewhere. As all senators know, petitions require a signature, so the best the Democrats could possibly be offering is that they will pass the protests on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well as these petitions, people accessing the site are invited to `Send a postcard to the Prime Minister' on the issue of ABC funding. The postcard urges the Prime Minister to reply by e&hyphen;mail or in writing. Because the postcard asks that, the Internet user is clearly given the impression that the postcard will be sent electronically to the Prime Minister. Similarly to the case of the petitions, the sender is asked to enter their personal details <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4074"> onto the postcard form and again click on the `submit entry' button. The technological awareness the Democrats are trying to portray through their home page slips up somewhat however when you realise that the Prime Minister does not have an Internet address.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, on the issue of higher education funding and Austudy, people are invited to enter their personal details into a form and press a `submit entry' button and, by implication, send an electronic message to me. I do have an e-mail address but in the past two months I have not received a single electronic message of the form being used on the Democrat home page. If the Prime Minister cannot receive electronic mail and I am not getting the mail, one of two things is happening: either I am the only person looking at the Democrat home page or they are pretending to people using the Internet that they will send their protests on. They are not sending them on either electronically or in hard copy to either the Prime Minister or me, and that does invite the question of whether the Internet is being misused to collect issue based address lists, which would of course be a breach of the privacy principles which the Democrats so strongly support being applied to the non&hyphen;government sector.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA>The simple situation that we face, now that Senator Short has gone, is that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, Senator Gibson, should go too. The circumstances in relation to Senator Gibson are no different <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> from those that surrounded Senator Short. Senator Short was in breach of the ministerial guidelines of the Prime Minister, Mr Howard. Senator Gibson is also clearly in breach of Mr Howard's ministerial guidelines. Mr Howard has said that a minister or a parliamentary secretary must divest themselves of their shareholding in their relevant area of responsibility. Mr Howard says that it is not optional. Mr Howard's guide to ministerial responsibility says that it is not optional. It is a requirement for every minister and every parliamentary secretary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Gibson is responsible for Corporations Law and the Australian Securities Commission. The 26 March press release of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) indicates that Senator Gibson has responsibility for `design of laws in relation to cheques and bills of exchange'&mdash;a responsibility that is clearly and squarely in the banking sector. He had responsibilities for overseeing the new arrangements for cheque clearing house procedures allowing superannuation companies to provide cheque arrangements for customers. This is an open and shut case of a parliamentary secretary who does have a conflict of interest. I say again: Senator Gibson must go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Until today Senator Gibson had a very significant portfolio of shares in the National Australia Bank and in the Bank of Melbourne. He also, apparently, retained shares in Amcor, in Woolworths, in CRA, in AGL, in BHP, in BTR, in Boral, in Brambles, in CSR, in FH Faulding, in National Foods and in Simsmetal. Last Thursday it was Senator Gibson who came into this chamber and said, `I am not involved in banking.' They are Senator Gibson's own words&mdash;`I am not involved in banking.' He said, `I can assure the Senate that I have had no conflict of interest during the last six months, nor do I expect one to occur.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, it took until Sunday before he announced he would sell his banking shares&mdash;Sunday, after Senator Short reluctantly, finally was dragged kicking and screaming out of the ministry. It took until Sunday before Senator Gibson announced he would sell his banking shares. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4077">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, he should have been sacked along with Senator Short on Wednesday or Thursday of last week by the Prime Minister. But Senator Gibson is a parliamentary secretary in a government that is led by John Howard, and that is the crucial thing. These are Mr Howard's standards of ministerial responsibility. Senator Gibson represents Mr Howard's standards of parliamentary propriety. Of course, they are very, very low standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen from Mr Howard weak and vacillating leadership on this issue, weak and vacillating leadership from a Prime Minister who is either unable or unwilling to ensure that his own code of conduct is acted upon by ministers and parliamentary secretaries in his own government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Hill, in this chamber, is an even weaker link in a chain of weak leadership in this government. Last Thursday Senator Hill came into this chamber and said, `I do not regret anything in relation to this matter.' He said in this chamber, `In no way do I regret his'&mdash;Senator Short's&mdash;`behaviour in relation to this matter.' We have a situation where, because of pressure from the opposition, John Howard did regret it publicly in the House of Representatives but failed to sack his minister. He did not even raise the matter of resignation with Senator Short. That is how weak and vacillating this Prime Minister is. Senator Short sacked himself.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Hill totally misses the point in this debate. He missed the point three or four days ago when he referred to these breaches of the ministerial guidelines as `technicalities' and as a `side issue'. We have seen how much of a technicality and a side issue it has been since Senator Short announced his resignation yesterday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me return to the press release of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) of March this year when he outlined the responsibilities of the previous Assistant Treasurer (Senator Short) and the duties of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator Gibson). I hope <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Senator Gibson will participate in this debate today to indicate to us why he will sell his shares and what he will do with the proceeds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was very clear that Senator Short had responsibility for administrative matters relating to the banking laws and a range of matters on insurance and superannuation. What did Senator Short hold? Thousands of shares in the ANZ bank&mdash;it was very clear. Senator Hill is right, it was on the record. As an opposition, when we were checking the record, we were rather amazed that Senator Short continued to hold shares in a banking stock and, at the same time, have responsibility for the development of administrative matters in the banking sector and insurance and superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we checked this record, we looked at Senator Gibson. Let us look at Senator Gibson's responsibilities&mdash;point 2 under this press release, `Design of laws in relation to cheques and bills of exchange'&mdash;and then at Senator Gibson's share portfolio. The portfolio is quite extensive. The important area there is the case of NAB, 5,000 shares, and the case of the Bank of Melbourne, 2,300 shares. He has some direct responsibilities relating to banking and a very important and controversial issue, the issue of the clearing house for cheques, and he holds bank shares.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a direct conflict of interest. Let us look at this document <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Guide on Key Elements of Ministerial Responsibility</EMPHASIS> of the Prime Minister, Mr Howard&mdash;not a Labor document, a document laid down by your government when you were elected to government, promising integrity. This is your document, your promise, which the Prime Minister is failing to uphold.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Specifically, I challenge Parliamentary Secretary Gibson to participate in this debate. He has the opportunity here now to get up and tell the Senate why he is not in conflict with these guidelines, why he has maintained this share ownership for the last six months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He is nodding his head. He obviously does not want to explain to the Senate about this conflict of interest. He can also tell us what he is going to do with the profit from these shares. Senator Short said the $9,000&hyphen;odd profit would be going to charity. Fine. Is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4079"> Senator Gibson going to do the same thing? I hope he gets up and outlines that, because Senator Gibson's holding in NAB&mdash;as I informed the Senate during question time&mdash;has moved from $58,150 to $67,650. That is an increase of $9,500 in the last six months.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One would have thought that we do not have an unemployment rate in this country, that there is no overseas debt in this country, that all our indigenous people have excellent health standards, because the Australian Labor Party are not concerned about the real issues facing ordinary Australians today.

Why was Gary Johns allowed to survive? No-one on the other side can answer that. They cannot answer it because they are absolutely caught out on that one. Senator Collins is hanging his head now.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Once again, we have from Senator Abetz an avoidance of the issue, an attack on personality, a raising of irrelevance and everything to dodge the issue. The issue here is that at the election the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) declared that he would introduce a new standard of parliamentary honesty in Australia. He set down a standard for which ministers had to comply. The issue in this parliament is the credibility of the Prime Minister and the adherence to those standards <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> proclaimed by him by his own ministers, junior ministers and parliamentary secretaries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The record is of non-compliance. The record is that the Prime Minister on this subject must regard it not as a core undertaking to the Australian people but rather as an undertaking he feels obliged on whim and on wish to break. Therefore, his conduct is to be characterised properly as being weak in leadership and sneaky in behaviour. One can blame his ministers less than him if they then adopt the same approach to how they might comply with the guidelines he has laid down. They can be blamed less than the Prime Minister but they can be not excused at all from not complying with the guidelines that have been laid down. The fundamental responsibility rests where the buck stops, and the buck stops with the Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has been said in this debate that is true is that not only did the Prime Minister set down these standards but when they were broken he did not act to enforce them. It required Senator Short to do that. While Senator Short's reputation may have risen because he did resign of his own volition, as we understand, the Prime Minister's reputation for honesty and integrity in public life declined. It was Senator Short who made that decision, not the Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue also relates to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, Senator Gibson, who holds a range of shares including shares in several banks. When Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer and with specific responsibilities for the Corporations Law of Australia, for the Australian Securities Commission, for the design of laws regarding cheques and bills of exchange and for a range of things which relate to banking, he held shares in banks. He held shares in significant banks&mdash;the National Australia Bank and the Bank of Melbourne&mdash;while discharging his parliamentary responsibilities and his executive responsibilities as a parliamentary secretary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The defence to that is that, if a decision came his way that related to his shareholding, he would pass it back to the Treasurer (Mr Costello). I think a public interest issue here is: is that what is meant by the Prime Minister's guidelines, or is that a confection <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4081"> in order to avoid the implication of not being in the range of apparently not being complicit and therefore having to resign?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us go to no lesser authority in order to understand the meaning of the guidelines than the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister himself said that the guidelines refer to ministers&mdash;and in that reading we include parliamentary secretaries&mdash;where it is in `relevant areas of responsibility.' What were the relevant areas of responsibility for parliamentary secretary? They were, as I have said, issues of the design of law for banks and bills of exchange and other matters related to the banking industry. They included the Corporations Law and the Australian Securities Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no question that that falls within a relevant area of responsibility, and I think on second thought Senator Gibson may have recognised that because he then moved to divest himself of those shares. This raises the question that, given that we are all of the same view, why does he not now stand down from his position as parliamentary secretary as Senator Short has stood down from his position as minister? If he does not stand down, why does the Prime Minister not act?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If leadership is vacillating, indecisive and unsure of itself, the people who follow that leadership will act accordingly. The buck stops with the Prime Minister. There is a clear issue here: the Prime Minister should act.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He has to ask leave, Senator Faulkner. Anyway, let me get on with what I want to say. We have been talking about the link between ministerial responsibility for policy and, through the ownership of shares, the links with institutions which would have influence on policy or would give the opportunity for individuals to profit from those links.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point I want to focus on is the fundamental importance of banking policy. Senator Kemp in his answer to another question actually said, `We do want to make policy which benefits banks.' I want the government to make policy which takes into account the rights of consumers when they are deciding to benefit banks. I want the government to make policy which is transparent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why I raised the questions of the decisions which refer to allowing governments unlimited access to superannuation through retirement savings accounts. That is the direct link that we have seen being made between Senator Short's responsibility as minister and the reason for his resignation, and today we are pursuing that link in the case of Senator Gibson.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I went beyond that today, and I think this is just as important. There is a broader conflict of interest question when you look at party organisations and you can see such a direct and overt link with a person who is the Chairman of the ANZ Bank&mdash;the very bank that I believe dreamed up the concept of retirement savings accounts. I have certainly been lobbied by the ANZ Bank over the five years I have been in this place. They were the first people to come to me with the idea of banks getting into the superannuation issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a huge question of conflict of interest between when a person wears a party <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4082"> hat&mdash;in this case a Liberal Party trustee who is also on two major Liberal Party fundraising organisations&mdash;and when he is at the same time the Chairman of the ANZ Bank. We have to start thinking about opportunities when it might be okay when the Liberal Party is in opposition because it thinks that these people will not have any influence on policy, but when the Liberal Party moves from opposition to government and you are the chair of a major bank and you have these links with the party, then quite clearly your party hat and your corporate hat overlap. I would like to see the government and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) explain to the people of Australia how they are entitled to have confidence in public policy making on the issue of banking when this other broader potential conflict of interest exists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that is a really important question because the ANZ Bank donated $171,000 to the Liberal Party. The other two Liberal Party fundraising vehicles&mdash;Valpol and the Cormack Foundation&mdash;donated $1.4 million. There is a huge link. There is a huge public policy question about when do you stop being a trustee of the Liberal Party and start being the Chairman of the ANZ Bank, who wants a huge change in banking policy which will result in influence to their bank as those who dreamed up the idea of retirement savings accounts&mdash;to the disadvantage of consumers.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;In a question asked by Senator Tierney to Senator Newman as the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Family Services earlier today, there were some statements made in relation to a report which I have circulated to all voters in the electorate of Robertson as part of my duties as duty senator in that area. There were some statements made that what was contained in that report was potentially misleading. Extracts were read from what was purportedly a letter received from the Woy Woy Community Nursing Home.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would just like to put on the record that I have spoken to the Woy Woy nursing home. Any correspondence sent to me in relation to any matter was not authorised for distribution and any member of the Senate who obtained a letter was doing so when they were not authorised. They are very concerned that the personal nature of their correspondence has been breached by members of this House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In relation to what was said by the minister, I would just like to say that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Robertson Report</EMPHASIS> is very clearly an information brochure put out by myself. It puts forward the views that I hold in relation to the policies of this government and the effect that the budget has on people in the community and in the electorate of Robertson. It in no way purports to be the statement of any other person but me and certainly does not purport to represent the views of anyone at the Woy Woy nursing home or anyone else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to refer to some of the contents of that letter. The front-page article, the subject of some debate, says that the government proposes to put in place a fee of $26,000, on average, for entry to nursing <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4083"> homes. That statement was made by the department and is in no way incorrect. The range is $0 to $88,000&mdash;a range that Senator Newman confirmed in debate in this forum. Certainly, $26,000 is a reasonably low figure against the average of $0 and $88,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for nursing home residents having to pay $34 a day as a result of this budget, again, that is a fact which has not been stated to be incorrect either by Senator Newman in the Senate or by anyone else. In fact, that figure was confirmed in the estimates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The very interesting thing about the minister's response to Senator Tierney's question was that even though she had read the correspondence, in no way did she say that any of the information contained in the Robertson report was incorrect. If the minister believes that any of the statements are incorrect I ask her to come forward and put that to the Senate tomorrow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My view is that when changes of policy are made that affect people in the community, particularly the elderly, those people are entitled to know so that they have an opportunity to be involved in the debate. It is a bit like saying that you should not tell people a flood is coming because they might be frightened by it, or that you should not tell people that a fire is coming&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The statement read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Report deals with the group of six treaties which were tabled on 10 and 11 September in both Houses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Without exception, the Committee supports the proposed treaty action in each instance. This is largely a reflection of the non&hyphen;controversial nature of the treaty obligations under review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are, however, four points I think that should be made in connection with this report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Firstly, we have proposed some simple procedures for tabling future amendments of the International Convention on Whaling.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unless a contracting state lodges an objection, amendments to this Convention automatically come into force 90 days following the date of notification from the Secretariat of the International Whaling Commission. If this situation arises, the amendments do not come into effect for any of the Contracting Governments for an additional 90 days.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The practical effect of such a default procedure in this instance is to preclude compliance with the Government's new procedures for parliamentary scrutiny of treaties, which prescribe that treaty actions should be tabled in Parliament for at least 15 sitting days.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On this occasion, the proposed amendments were presented to the President of the Senate on 19 August and tabled in the House of Representatives on 10 September 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee appreciates the Environment Minister's intention to bring these amendments before the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We consider that the following procedures would be appropriate, should this situation recur:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister should write to the Committee providing details of the proposed amendments, together with a copy of the National Interest Analysis within 10 working days from the date of notification by the Secretariat of the IWC.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This material should then be tabled at the first opportunity in both Houses when Parliament sits, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4092"> along with a brief explanatory note, or reference in the NIA, outlining the unusual arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee considers that adopting these procedures would allow timely consideration of future amendments to the Convention or Schedule, as well as ensuring the primacy of the proceedings of both Houses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, NIAs tabled so far have generally included reference to the provisions for denunciation of or withdrawal from treaties. While it has not made a formal recommendation on either matter, the Committee believes that it would be assisted in its work if NIAs also included reference to provisions for attaching reservations to treaties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The third point I would like to make is that in this report and in its First Report, the Committee has met its remit from the Parliament of 15 sitting days to consider all 31 treaties tabled to date. This has been possible only as the result of the unexceptional nature of most of these treaties, and the commitment of Committee members to meet a heavy work load in a new area of Parliamentary inquiry which satisfies public need and community involvement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I pointed out in tabling our first report, this is the newest and second largest committee in the Parliament. While our first two reports have dealt with treaties which have not generated large public responses, the same cannot be said about the other two inquiries we are holding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The response to the inquiry into the Subsidiary Agreement with Japan on long line tuna fishing has been significant and generated a heavy round of hearings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the case of the inquiry into the UN Convention to combat desertification our first public hearing has revealed that there are a number of complex issues to be resolved, including the implications of the High Court's Teoh decision on the application of the convention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tomorrow a large group of treaties will be tabled with a number of substantial matters for us to examine.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This raises the issue of the 15 sitting day period available for parliamentary scrutiny. The Committee is not unhappy about the limitations imposed by this period. I think, however, that all of its members would want me to point out that there will be times when the 15 sitting day limit cannot be observed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the amended Sitting Pattern for the rest of 1996, it will probably not be possible for us to report on all of the group to be tabled tomorrow on 21 November. That is when the 15 days elapses for this group of treaties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Foreign Affairs is already aware it is likely that some of this group of treaties will not be reported on within this time frame. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some of these treaties could even become the subject of longer inquiries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My final point is this. At this early stage of the Committee's life, it is becoming clear that our work is the subject of considerable public interest, which is to be expected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are a new committee which only came into existence at the start of this Parliament as a result of public concerns about the treaty&hyphen;making process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a lively committee with a considerable and varied workload. I would like to pay tribute to its members for their hard work. The new members of the Parliament have been particularly dedicated in their attendance, and I hope this will continue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the report to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</PARA>

<STATE> (Queensland)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(4.14 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That there be laid on the table, within 24 hours, by the Minister representing the Prime Minister (Senator Hill), any correspondence or documents signed by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) or the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Fisher) relating to the Port Hinchinbrook development.</PARA>
<PARA>I want to proceed with this motion despite the confusion about the process that we had on Thursday last. What we wanted to do at that time&mdash;and we agreed that this should happen today&mdash;was to move to the substantive issue which is under debate. The substantive issue is to do with the responsibilities of the Minister for the Environment, Senator Hill, whether or not he was able to fulfil his responsibilities under the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act and whether or not he has been compromised in terms of those responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer to an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Townsville Bulletin</EMPHASIS> which quoted the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) as having said that he got personally involved in the decision. Also, the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Fischer, told a National Party conference that the government would give conditional support to the development. Both of those statements were made on dates well before Senator Hill had made his determination about the possible adverse effects on world heritage values of the area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further information has come to light that either the Prime Minister or the Deputy Prime Minister may have indicated these commitments in writing. This is serious and has serious implications under the World Heritage Properties Act as it may indicate interference or influence with regard to the environment minister's responsibility under this act. As you can appreciate, Mr Acting Deputy President, if this were the case, it would be an extremely serious matter and open to legal challenge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that Senator Hill has not denied that such correspondence exists, so I presume that he is accepting the proposition that such letters have been written. He has complained about the trouble we have caused him in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> having to produce documents. I might point out that in this regard I agreed to three extensions to the time on the original return to order. He only complied with the order at midnight on the day on which he himself had nominated, namely, Tuesday 18 October 1996, and he tabled the documents during the adjournment debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Hinchinbrook has been a long running saga of government ineptitude. In reply to Senator Hill's reference to FOI, I have spent some hundreds of dollars paying to obtain other documents, particularly from the Queensland government, under FOI legislation. That is how seriously I take this particular issue. Step after step in the long trail of permits to this day have revealed that there has been maladministration, shortcuts and grave abuse of policy and process. According to a number of pieces of correspondence I have, there have been attempts, particularly by the developer, Mr Williams, to beat government officials into submission. I have no reason to believe that the latest round of approvals is any different.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I indicate to the Senate that last week, when I questioned Senator Hill, he did not give me an answer, particularly about whether or not he was subjected to threats or pressure from Mr Williams. He simply referred to the basis in terms of his statement of reasons on which I based that question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me point out that the developer's energies so far have been directed at removing mangroves and wanting to create an artificial beach and to dredge the Hinchinbrook Channel. This is in spite of the fact that, for the whole of the period under dispute, the developer has had permission, permits and access to the site itself, and nobody could have stopped him from developing that site. There was no problem with it. Yet he has not poured one cubic metre of concrete. All he has sought to do at every point is to impact on world heritage values, to destroy the environment and to attack those who stand in his way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The developer's actions will impact on world heritage values such as seagrass beds, fish nurseries and dugong populations. Also, the resort would mean a significant increase <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4094"> in the number of tourists visiting adjacent areas of the Great Barrier Reef and Hinchinbrook Island. That increase&mdash;this is on the record in many places&mdash;would adversely affect these fragile environments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason I am putting this on the record is to show that the minister has serious responsibilities under the World Heritage Properties Act. If these responsibilities have been interfered with in any way&mdash;even if it is by the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister&mdash;that is a very serious matter indeed and one which this Senate has a deep interest in. It underlines the reason for asking for these documents, so that we can know one way or the other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not too late to prevent the damage which is being done in this area. It is still possible to negotiate a much more appropriate development in line with ecotourism guidelines. But to be able to do that, we need to stop this developer from proceeding with the kind of development which he has projected, to make him understand that if he were only reasonable, other reasonable people could negotiate with him a much better development for the environment and also for the town.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the developer, Mr Williams, has a long history of using bullying and threats to get what he wants. The Senate Privileges Committee declared that he had threatened me, although it said that he would not be sued for contempt because it did not stop me from carrying out my duties as a senator. This afternoon I have been told by another member of this Senate that he too was threatened some years ago by staff of Mr Williams. In spite of those threats, I am willing to continue to try to get an appropriate development for the site for the sake of employment opportunities for the small township of Cardwell which is nearby.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot stress enough to the Senate how important it is to obtain this correspondence from the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister to add to the picture of how the consents were given by the federal government. The amount of paper would not be anything like that involved in the substantial returns to order so far.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do agree that Senator Hill, the Minister for the Environment, has provided substantial amounts of documents. But it is not much use if the critical documents are not included. You might as well provide boxes of confetti if the critical documents are not available, and that is what we are trying to get at. It should only be a few letters at the very most. You will note also that I have not asked for incoming correspondence but rather outgoing correspondence in order to make it as easy as possible for the Minister for the Environment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did indicate when the suspension of standing orders was debated on this matter on 10 October that I would go to the substantive issues during that debate. That was in the interests of ensuring that this matter is progressed through the chamber as quickly as possible. I do not really want to revisit the issues that I canvassed there at any length. I did indicate previously that the opposition would support this substantive motion when it came before the parliament. We see no reason to change our commitment in that regard and we will be supporting the motion that has been moved by Senator Woodley.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The matter here is that the government defends its actions in relation to the tabling of documents on the basis that there have been very substantial numbers of documents tabled in the Senate. It would be churlish not to say that that has been the case because clearly a lot of pages of documents have been tabled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The key point is that the crucial documents, the sensitive, most revealing documents, are the ones that have not been tabled by Senator Hill, who came into the Senate chamber at the hour of midnight early in the last sitting week and sought leave to table even more documents, many of which have been on the public record for a long time. He did not include legal advices, correspondence between colleagues&mdash;e-mails, memos or drafts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the point, because we do want to look at the very clear contradiction between the statements Senator Hill has made at the Senate estimates committee and in this chamber during question time that he and he alone was responsible for making a decision on the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4095"> go&hyphen;ahead for the Port Hinchinbrook development. This claim is in very clear conflict with statements that have been made by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Fischer).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Howard made clear in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Townsville Bulletin</EMPHASIS> newspaper that he had been personally involved in this project and made a number of very clear statements in relation to his own interest in the matter. Mr Fischer, on the other hand, spoke in an interview on Queensland regional radio and then at a conference of the Queensland National Party&mdash;which would be something that none of us, I am sure, would ever want to attend but, unfortunately or fortunately, the speech he made at that conference was made public&mdash;and there is Mr Fischer in black and white claiming credit for this development going ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the one hand, we have Mr Howard and Mr Fischer claiming credit for making this decision and, on the other hand, we have Senator Hill saying, `Oh no, the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister did not stand over me. They had nothing to do with it. I don't take any notice at all of Mr Howard and Mr Fischer. It was my decision and mine alone.' And there is on this matter&mdash;as, I think, all senators accept&mdash;a very severe credibility problem for this environment minister in this administration who is so regularly stood over by his cabinet colleagues on so many issues on so many occasions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the situation that this Senate is faced with. It is for this reason that the opposition believes that it is appropriate for us to support this motion so at least we get closer to the truth of this important matter. I have absolutely no doubt that Senator Hill is involved in nothing more or less than a cover&hyphen;up on this issue. It is Senator Hill's stock&hyphen;in&hyphen;trade on this issue. There is no doubt that we have an attempted cover&hyphen;up from Senator Hill and the opposition has dedicated itself to ensuring that the truth comes out.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of my time, I must admit, and long hours of very successful and forensic cross&hyphen;examination of this minister at estimates committee hearings. While at times we have been able to extract information from the minister and of responsible officers&mdash;it is like getting blood out of a stone&mdash;there is still a lot of information that the minister has withheld. It is as simple as that. Information has been withheld and, as far as the opposition is concerned, we have indicated that we intend to get to the bottom of this and we will be supporting the motion accordingly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot of the environmental arguments that have been mounted in relation to Port Hinchinbrook have a lot of resonance with me and, I am sure, with all members of the opposition. We do hold the responsibilities that this nation has to protect the Great Barrier Reef world heritage area as very important in terms of the protection of the environment in this country. I suspect in the international community there is no world heritage area in this country or perhaps even internationally that is viewed as more significant than the Great Barrier Reef world heritage area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All world heritage areas require the highest standards of protection and conservation of their values. That is certainly the case with this. It is for that reason that the opposition has spent so much time ensuring that those values are protected. It is for that reason and because of our commitment to both accountability and transparency of process in government that we will maintain our strong commitment, just as we have led the struggle to ensure that that world heritage area is protected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition, the Labor Party, will not resile from that commitment and from what has been since the election of this government a difficult challenge because of its reluctance to come forward with information on this issue and a range of other environmental issues.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The sensitivity of the Labor Party on this matter is not surprising because Labor in government and Senator Faulkner as minister gave certain consents to this development. The coalition in government, with me as environment minister, have given consents. They are not identical consents and both, Senator Faulkner, were conditional. Your consents, in fact, were raised by Senator Woodley in his contribution today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But this is really something of a diversion from the real question. The real question is: how far should this fishing expedition go after the production by me of literally thousands of pages of documents in this place? Senator Woodley then goes on about both the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer). No doubt after this motion is carried&mdash;and it will be carried because the numbers are with Senator Woodley on this occasion&mdash;Senator Woodley will seek yet another return to order from other parties. Where will it end?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suggest that this is becoming an abusive process. It is overly expensive. There are ways to do it. You know the matter is before the court. There will be orders of discovery. There are FOI orders. There are returns to order. But the way in which this return to order process is now being used in the Senate <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is not the way in which it was intended to be used. It is therefore being abused.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, however, I thought Senator Woodley's contribution, with respect, was more measured than in the past. It is interesting that his primary criticism seems to relate to the size of this particular development, and that is no doubt a debate that might progress further in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope I have indicated that I oppose the motion, although I know we will lose. Just in case there is any misunderstanding, I did not seek to avoid that part of your question the other day. In fact I do not actually recall it in those terms, but there was no threat or pressure applied to me by Mr Williams in this matter. I concede there were an awful lot of letters written, all of which I think now are on the public record. But there was no threat or pressure applied to me. All consents that were given in this matter were given by me and me alone.

The Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill), in covering his tracks on environmental issues, has said, when Senator Woodley asked to drill down 100 metres to get to the kernel of this matter, `I'll let you go 99.9 metres.' You can put all the energy into it, you can get 10,000 documents handed across, but when it comes down to internal memos and some e-mail documents which are exactly what Senator Woodley is after, the minister says, `I ain't going to give them to you.'

He is the defender of a single Australian's public interest in this matter and that is Mr Keith Williams.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently Senator Hill, in defence of the environment, said, `I'm going to put special effort into protecting the dugong, the sea cow,' this wonderful animal that fortunately is not mythological. It still hangs on, and hangs on probably best in Australian waters than anywhere else in the world. It is dependent on places like the Hinchinbrook Channel. On the one hand the minister says, `I'm going to defend this remarkable mammal.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what he has not been able to show in the documents that have come forward to date is how he will get around the problem that 200 fast&hyphen;speed motorboats in that channel plus a mega&hyphen;tourist launch will create for this animal. We know that boat strikes are one of the major causes of death of these remarkable animals, which are slow to regenerate and live to a great age, but get cut off in their prime as they are grazing on the sea grasses when they panic at the approach of high&hyphen;speed motorboats and get bumped and killed, much like the manatees of Florida. That is just one example of what is being covered up when the minister says that he is going to protect the environment that is going to be impacted upon by the Keith Williams proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This cover-up should not be tolerated by the Senate. The Senate is, if nothing else, about getting information out to the Australian people, whose property these world heritage areas are. If the minister is not going to be responsible enough in his position to present the documents which Senator Woodley has been waiting for for some time now, then I guess it is up to the Senate to vote to enforce the request for information that Senator Woodley has so correctly pressed in the Senate in the interests not only of his constituency but the Australian constituency as a whole.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Export Control (Hardwood Wood Chips) (1996) Regulations and the Export Control (Unprocessed Wood) Regulations (Amendment), as contained in Statutory Rules 1996 Nos 206 and 207, respectively, and made under the Export Control Act 1982, be disallowed. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4099"> </PARA>
<PARA>If I could condense and clarify that, I simply move that the Senate disallow the government's export woodchip regulations which were gazetted a couple of weeks ago and which put into place a sham as far as any real move towards the protection of Australia's fast disappearing native forests, their ecosystems and the vast array of wildlife within them, including many species facing extinction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Around the world we see the rate of extinctions now of our fellow creatures at about 50 per day. Dr Norman Myers, the great British scientist who was one of the signatories to the appeal to the world by some 1,200 scientists in 1992 to turn around the factors leading to mass extinctions and which may ultimately lead to the unsustainability of life on the planet, including that of we human beings, was here two weeks ago. He pointed out that it is the loss of forests, above all, which is creating the onward rush to extinction around the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We as a northern, developed, rich country ought to be taking a lead in a world stand against the destruction of what is going on in the Amazon, Siberia, Papua New Guinea and elsewhere. But instead, we are going in the wrong direction. Along comes the Howard government which touted itself before the election as the best alternative and as a government which was going to protect the interests of the environment. In the months since it came to power, it has greatly accelerated the rate of destruction of Australia's native forest heritage. Whereas when this government took office, it was already at the obscenely high level of 5&frac14; million tonnes of Australia's native forest being exported as woodchips to the paper mills and then to the rubbish dumps of the northern hemisphere, the regulations which the minister has now brought in will allow that rate to go to 6&frac14; million tonnes per annum for starters&mdash;a nearly 20 per cent increase.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But on top of that, the government has lifted the lid off the destruction of forests on private land where very many of the most precious environments exist in this country, where many of those endangered plants and species of animal life are hanging on. That <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will be accelerated without limit. Except this limit: the regulations say that the minister has a responsibility to appoint an inspector&mdash;there is no qualification on what that person's expertise should be&mdash;to ensure that the forests are degraded. When you look at the definition of degraded, you find that it does not exist. It can be anything. Worse, under these regulations, the government will be able to blame parliament, or at least give parliament the responsibility as minister after minister allows what he or she judges as degraded forests to go to the woodchippers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Looking at the regulations, they provide no incentive for forests to be protected if they are of high conservation value. In fact, as these regulations read, it is very clearly possible for a landowner who does have very important forest with very important species within it to allow that forest to be degraded, to allow it to be cut down and then to apply for an export woodchip licence so that when the inspector arrives, he or she finds it has been degraded and says, `Tick, it can go to the export woodchip mill.' It is the wrong way to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We ought to be giving incentives to those private landowners who are protecting what is part of the nation's heritage. We ought to be regulating to penalise to the extent that it prevents the destruction of that heritage where private landowners do not have the wider interests at heart or, indeed, need an incentive through government to protect that part of the national heritage which they own.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The regulations also allow for trial shipments to be sent to new markets. No limit is put on those. They also allow for unlimited export woodchipping to come from areas classed as having undergone a forest agreement. Just in the last couple of days we have seen the potential for such an agreement in East Gippsland. Once implemented, it would mean unlimited woodchipping within the parameters of that agreement from East Gippsland. But that agreement, which this minister and his state compatriots would like to enter into, protects not one tree in East Gippsland in national park&mdash;not one piece of protection which has teeth in it. And wild and wondrous parts of East Gippsland, including parts which are the stronghold of endangered <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4100"> species like Leadbeater's possum, the sooty owl and the longfooted potoroo will not get national park protection under this process. But the woodchippers get the protection; they get the sky's the limit nod through these regulations from the federal government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is much better that the Senate disallow these regulations and require the minister at least to work by the 1986 regulations, which would then come back into force. There is one remitting reason for that. The minister himself&mdash;whether it be the minister for forests, the minister for primary industries, or the minister for the environment&mdash;would be required to own up to the responsibility for what they are doing when they sign the export woodchip licences which allow mega&hyphen;companies, like Boral, Wesfarmers in Western Australia and North in Tasmania, to maraud national estate forests, to log World Heritage value forests, as in the Tarkine, Picton and Huon valleys in Tasmania and in the Great Western Tiers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They cut from under them the living universe in the forests for so many of Australia's marvellous marsupial and bird species, and a myriad of insect species, many of which are still not identified or known to science and many of whose roles are still not even understood. Successive governments give the nod to the bulldozers and the chainsaws moving in on this fantastic natural asset which is being destroyed at a record rate in this wonderful country of ours. Each morning we wake up to find there is less forest than ever before in history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to point to the criticality of this vote. This vote is another means of accelerating the obscene export woodchipping industry which is marauding our forests. Yet, if I read it correctly, no less than eight senators in here hold shares in those big export woodchip companies. Herein is a conflict of interest, I submit. I do not believe it is ethically correct that people who hold shares in these woodchip companies ought to be voting for this motion which is in their benefit, which will add to their profit lines, which will give them licences for the increased destruction of our forests and export&mdash;at the profit of those <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> companies&mdash;to the paper mills of the Northern Hemisphere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The increasing export under this government, outside the woodchip trade, is of whole logs from Tasmania. This government is currently giving a licence to the Tasmanian Forestry Commission, now named Forestry Tasmania, to export 100,000 tonnes of plantation softwood logs, totally unprocessed&mdash;with them go the jobs&mdash;to the Northern Hemisphere. Those logs ought to be protected, ought to be substituting for the cutting down of our native forests, which are supporting what remains of the sawlog allocation from our forest industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that every senator who holds shares in Boral, or Wesfarmers, North or any of the smaller woodchip companies that are involved, ought to think very carefully about the impropriety of voting for this motion if that is what they are considering doing.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The forest policy that John Howard took to the last election bears no resemblance whatsoever to the policy that is outlined in these regulations. Back in March John Howard gave no indication that when in government he would raise the export quota, that he would abandon the two-stage licensing system or that he would allow an unlimited volume of  woodchips cleared from privately owned forests to be exported. Yet that is precisely what these regulations allow.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4102">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, at the launch of the coalition's environment policy on 31 January 1996 in the Dandenong Ranges National Park, John Howard was directly asked about export woodchip quotas. The following is a direct extract from the Prime Minister's own transcript, and I think it really demonstrates the depth of the deception of the coalition on this issue:</PARA>

At the last election the Australian community understood when they elected a Howard government that it would not change the woodchip regime. These regulations and the increased woodchip quota contained in them are nothing more or less than an explicit broken promise from the Liberals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition took the conservation movement for a ride during the last election campaign. They sweet&hyphen;talked and conned a few people like poor naive and gullible Mr Alec Marr of the Wilderness Society into believing that the Liberal Party would manage the environment as well as and if not better than Labor. That is what they conned poor old Alec Marr with. Mr Marr is quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper on 2 February 1996 as saying that the coalition's policy `is still much better than the government's'. Don't these regulations prove what a sucker Alec Marr really is. Don't they show not only what a sucker Alec Marr was but also how dishonest the coalition was prepared to be in an attempt to neutralise the green vote at the last election. I am pleased to say that it was an attempt that failed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After only seven months in office, the Howard government's environmental credentials are in tatters. Today Australia is lumbered with an insipid and wimpy Minister for the Environment in the form of Senator Hill, who shows absolutely no commitment to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> protecting the environment. I must say that Senator Hill's record speaks for itself, doesn't it? Since March, this Australian environment minister has managed to preside over the cutting of the environment budget by 13 per cent; he has given the green light to the Port Hinchinbrook development; he has failed to progress the government's response to greenhouse gas emissions; he has supported the expansion of uranium mines in Australia; he has given state governments veto powers over the listing of World Heritage areas; he has attempted to abolish the export control powers for minerals, which in the past have been used to protect environmentally sensitive areas from sandmining; and, of course, he has announced a massive increase in the amount of woodchips to be exported from Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased that you are here, Senator Parer, because as the Minister for Resources and Energy you are the de facto environment minister. You are running the show; you are running Senator Hill. On environment policy, Senator Hill, I am afraid that Senator Parer is running you; that is, if and when Mr Howard and Mr Fischer do not roll over the top of you like they did on the Port Hinchinbrook development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard government's record on the environment is appalling. You are the responsible minister and you wear it, Senator Hill. It is no wonder that the Executive Director of the Australian Conservation Foundation, Jim Downey, said&mdash;at last&mdash;on Thursday on ABC radio that the conservation movement in this country did make a major mistake in trusting the coalition at all on its word in the last election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> These regulations are flawed. They provide no protection for the environment and provide no guarantee that a genuinely sustainable forest industry will be developed. The regulations state that one of their main purposes is to `encourage investment in value added production in forest industries', but there is nothing in the detail of these regulations which would indicate that this new licensing system will encourage investment in value added production in forest industries. There is nothing at all in these regulations that allow that to take place.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4103">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, by substantially increasing the volume of woodchips exported, the regulations encourage the processing of Australia's forest resources overseas. They do not encourage the industry to invest in value adding technology on Australian shores. This is a major concern for workers in the forest industry, as I suspect you, Mr Acting Deputy President Murphy, would know better than probably any other senator in this chamber. It is a very major concern for workers in the timber industry in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The coalition would like the community to believe that these regulations only allow for an extra one million tonnes of woodchips to be exported. However, I think the ceiling on woodchips is made meaningless by the substantial quantities of woodchips which will be permitted to be exported under the degraded forest licences, which are not counted in the ceiling of 5.2 million tonnes plus one million tonnes&mdash;they are not counted in that ceiling. The ceiling contained in these regulations is nothing more or less than a sham, and it has been exposed as a sham.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The abandonment of the previous government's two-stage licensing system is a further indication that the Howard  government has no plans to ensure progress is made towards a comprehensive, adequate and representative system of forest reserves. The mechanism that was contained in the previous regulations provided a very important means of ensuring that state and territory governments did progress the national forest policy statement. The absence of the two-stage licensing system in these regulations seriously risks proper implementation of the NFPS, which is something that Labor has been committed to for a number of years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The government announced its transitional woodchip regime in July, and it has taken them over three months to draft new regulations. It is surprising that, despite the extended time taken in the preparation of these regulations, they are still so technically inadequate. For instance, there is no definition of `degraded forest'. Interestingly enough, poor old, inadequate, wimpy Senator Hill is excluded from the process which will determine what constitutes a degraded forest. Back in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> July, when the policy was announced, the environment minister was to be consulted on what constituted a degraded forest. However, the regulations as we see them now make no reference to poor old Senator Hill, the environment minister, whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must come to Senator Hill's defence, seeing that he is absolutely unable to come to his own defence. I will come to his defence and say that Senator Hill's omission from this process illustrates the lack of balance the Howard government has on forest policy and on environment matters more broadly. I am afraid it does nothing other than demonstrate the complete lack of influence that poor old Senator Hill, as the environment minister, has in this particular government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once again, poor old Senator Hill has been shafted by the National Party. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Anderson&mdash;ably supported by Senator Parer, the Minister for Resources and Energy, who has been shafting him also&mdash;determines what is and what is not degraded forest. According to the regulations, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy must consider:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the general state of the forest, and, in particular, whether the floristic composition of the forest has been altered by reason of disease, weed infestation, harvesting and other human activities, or other causes, and any other relevant matter.</PARA>
<PARA>The minister must commission a report on the forest by an experienced and trained person who is independent of the applicant. But there is no outline of the necessary qualifications for this report writer. The person could be an expert in weeds or plant pathology and write a report which completely misses the major aspects of forest biodiversity and potential regeneration. There are no safeguards in these regulations for important conservation values even being identified, let alone considered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also no guarantee that forests which provide important habitats for native fauna will be protected. That is a subject that Senator Brown touched on in his contribution earlier. It is my view that the regulations limit the classification criteria for degraded forests to the floristic composition of the forests. There is no acknowledgment in the regulations that a forest, which could be judged <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4104"> degraded from a floristic point of view, might be an important habitat for native fauna.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's approval of unlimited woodchipping on privately owned land has significant biodiversity implications which the government is ignoring. The conversion of such forests to plantation instead of regrowth forests is a major step backwards for biodiversity. Plantations are seen normally as additional to existing native forests, reducing pressure on them in forestry production, not physically replacing them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The clearing of native forests in the 1960s, the 1970s and more recently to permit the establishment of pine plantations has resulted in the destruction of substantial areas of native forests in Australia. That is a matter of fact that even someone like Senator Hill probably would not deny. From the point of view of biodiversity, there is comparatively little difference between a eucalypt plantation and a pine plantation when compared with native forest, be it degraded, regrowth or old growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's forest policy is very clearly at odds with its vegetation policy. Poor old Senator Hill says he is keen to throw millions of dollars at revegetating this country through the national vegetation initiative. However, Mr Anderson's woodchip regulations actually exacerbate the problem by encouraging the clearing of forest on private land. The government is sending out contradictory signals. I think poor old Senator Hill's real vegetation policy has been exposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The regulations' failure to properly assess each private forest and address major biodiversity implications of clearing forest on private land illustrates this government's careless disregard for the environment and very irresponsible approach to forest policy. There is no doubt that these regulations represent a major setback to the protection of the environment. They include no incentive for the industry to invest in downstream processing, and they represent a significant broken promise by the Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard government has broken its promise to the Australian people&mdash;its solemn promise that it would protect the environment. It is now asking this parliament, this chamber, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to endorse that betrayal. For the opposition's part&mdash;the Labor Party's part&mdash;we will not join the government in that betrayal. We do not want any part of this process and we will support the disallowance motion.</PARA></SPEECH>

But the debate before the chamber is more important and I am sorry that Senator Faulkner decided to divert the debate into a rhetorical contest, because that is not what we are here about today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are here to debate these regulations and the attempt by Senator Brown to have them disallowed and to consider the consequences of that disallowance. Senator Brown, I have to say that I do not think the consequence was very well expressed by you. The principal consequence of success in your motion today will be that the ceiling is lifted. So the constituency that you primarily claim to represent is specifically disadvantaged if your motion succeeds. That is what I find extraordinary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can understand Senator Brown coming along and arguing the content of the regulations&mdash;perhaps arguing that they should be changed in various ways&mdash;but instead he is taking a step that will provide less protection for the interests of his constituency, rather than more. I find that astounding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Senator Brown also fails to acknowledge that woodchipping regulations do not threaten those important conservation values that we recognise the community wants to see protected. In fact, conversely, a decision to disallow these regulations would weaken the controls that this government intends to keep in place until regional forest agreements are com pleted. He also fails to acknowledge that his motion, if successful, will simply lead to more uncertainty for the forest industries and those workers and communities that depend upon our native forests for their livelihoods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even Senator Brown would surely concede that after years of debate the forest industry is not unreasonable in wanting a little certainty and a little security in relation to its future. The government, in developing these regulations, has given considerable consideration to the competing claims of those protagonists involved in the forest debate. Indeed, the development of these regulations follows what we can only describe as extensive and thorough consultations with both industry and the conservation movement, including the woodchip round table which the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) convened some months ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that these regulations represent an appropriate balance between the competing claims of those two groups. While neither industry nor the conservation movement received all they wanted, the regulations represented a good and fair policy outcome. In short, as I said, we have maintained ceilings within the regulations as a precautionary approach while RFAs are being developed. We have rejected arguments from those who I note include some in the Labor Party, such as the Tasmanian opposition leader Michael Field, who have called for the ceilings to be lifted altogether. We have, however, also created new categories of licences where we believe that by&hyphen;products of existing timber operations were being wasted. We have also taken action with strict controls to ensure that the development of hardwood plantations were not being unduly restricted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say in passing that the orderly development of these regulations stands in stark contrast to the record of disharmony and incompetence that marked the former government's attempt to resolve these matters, some of which we discussed a little earlier in this debate. In contrast with that politically motivated decision&hyphen;making process, our new woodchip export licensing arrangements will maintain the environmental and heritage value of Australia's forest while providing the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4107"> certainty required to develop an internationally competitive timber industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new system retains the woodchip export ceilings of 5.251 million tonnes. It retains the commitment that native forest hardwood woodchip exports from all native forest areas not covered by RFAs will be banned from the year 2000. This will ensure the continued commitment of states to participation in the RFA process. The new system would allow the export of an additional one million tonnes of woodchips sourced solely from sawmill residue and silvicultural thinnings. In many instances, this wasteful material would have been burnt rather than utilised to improve Australia's trade deficit in timber products. I remind the Senate that in current dollars the 1993&hyphen;94 trade deficit was $1.8 billion&mdash;and continues to worsen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another category of licence has been introduced to encourage the establishment of native hardwood plantations on private land. Woodchip exports will be permitted from the clearing of privately owned degraded forest where the forest is not needed for the comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system. Assessment of the degraded nature of the forest will be by a qualified, independent assessor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much of Senator Brown's criticism of the regulations is based on the misconception that the granting of an export licence somehow gives the licence holder a right to harvest material. This, of course, is not the case. The responsibility for land use management, including the management of forests, lies directly with state governments. The licensees will also continue to be required to comply with all Commonwealth, state and local environment protection laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the states' role as forest managers, the most appropriate way to ensure forest values, including environmental and production values, are protected is under agreements between the Commonwealth and the states. The government therefore remains committed to the national forest policy statement and its central goals of creating a world class forest reserve system and providing long&hyphen;term security for native forest based industries in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the context of ecologically sustainable forest management and use.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These goals will be achieved through regional forest agreements between the Commonwealth and the states. Large areas of forest which might be needed to establish a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system are now protected under the deferred forest agreements and interim forest agreements with the states. Industry is restricted to harvesting in areas outside these areas of interim protection. The DFAs and IFAs identify areas which might be required for the CAR reserve system and the states have agreed not to harvest in those areas for either export or domestic use.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This agreement not to harvest these possible future reserve areas is a significant achievement and will result in greater conservation gains than a ban on the export of woodchips after the trees have been harvested. RFAs will be negotiated to ensure that a CAR reserve system is established and that harvesting outside those reserves is done in an ecologically sustainable manner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The commitment of this government to the sustainable management of forest resource is also demonstrated by the provision of an additional $48 million for accelerating the RFA process. Comprehensive regional assessments leading to RFAs will be accelerated without compromising the integrity of the process to achieve a lasting resolution to the forest policy impasse of the past decade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the government must keep the pressure on to ensure RFAs are completed as quickly as possible. Therefore, as I have said, exports from areas not covered by RFAs will be prohibited from the year 2000. This important and necessary condition to achieving a world class forest reserve system is entrenched in the regulations which are now the subject of this motion to disallow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, Senator Brown fails to understand the consequence that, in the event of the success of his resolution, there will be no ceiling in the regulations that will take effect. But neither in the regulations that will take effect nor in the previous regulations is there a requirement to prohibit woodchip exports <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4108"> from the year 2000 for areas not covered by the regional forest agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the government can use the old unprocessed wood regulations, it will be required to implement the transitional woodchipping licensing arrangements by policy rather than regulation. There are obvious benefits in implementing such controls through regulation, not the least of which is the encouragement to the states to stay on course with implementing regional forest agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask: does Senator Brown realise the effects this  motion would have on regional Australia and industry investment? This government recognises that medium- to long-term security is a critical issue for industry. Previous decisions created a great deal of uncertainty for forest based industries and communities that depend on such industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many billions of dollars, principally for value adding projects in fibre board, wood pulp and paper production, would be invested by the forest industries if they were certain about long-term government policy direction and resource supply. This would enable more woodchips to be utilised domestically, increasing employment and providing value added products for export markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another point which I believe Senator Brown misconstrues is that these woodchips would come from trees that would be utilised for other purposes. Because there is greater value in producing saw logs and timber for furniture purposes, obviously that would be the chosen destination for timber that would be suitable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This timber is, however, entirely suitable for the production of printing grade papers. At the moment, the export market offers the highest returns for this valuable resource. Domestic processors' requirements for pulp are fully met from local suppliers. They cannot use all of the woodchip produced in Australia. Much of this material would have, in the past, been burnt rather than earning valuable income for all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The government believes that its forest policy has been made on firm and balanced decision making consistent with its recogni tion of regard for all Australians who want our forests for both their outstanding natural and cultural qualities as well as a source of continuing employment and wealth. The new regulations are a key part of the government's commitment to Australia's economic, social and environmental needs. I, therefore, urge honourable senators to vote against the motion before us today.</PARA></SPEECH>

Anything like a powerful owl actually roosting or landing in them is really something that I think defies the imagination. When you take into account the damage that is caused by strong winds in these areas, within about six months of this logging occurring even the few spindly trees that are left for these purposes are no longer standing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also suspect that the minister has not walked through these forests a year or two later. What we see coming back is not this ecologically sustainable forest that he has been talking about, with biodiversity and all the rest of it. Thanks to the chipping and management practices of the larger companies in particular and their regime of cutting not only in the coupes but also in adjacent coupes&mdash;certainly, I have walked in areas of East Gippsland that they should not have touched&mdash;you have only seed trees of a couple of species left.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4109">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The temperatures of the burning regime are such that you basically eliminate many of the other species, the undergrowth species, that would have come back. So what you end up with after a couple of years is matted pseudo-plantations of maybe two, possibly three, species&mdash;sometimes only one major species&mdash;so tightly packed together you can barely walk through them. They are so slow growing that one of the greatest incentives for these companies is to get out and plant their own plantations because they flourish far better than what remains of our native forests several years after logging.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To just look at where this chamber is today, it is with some disgust that I come in here yet again to debate this issue. What the government is asking us to do is to make a choice that boils down to which is the least worst decision. As has already been said, we have before us yet another broken promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the minister to suggest that the environment movement, that the conservation groups, are in any way supportive of his action also suggests that, as well as not spending very much time looking at the issue on the ground, he certainly has not spent a lot of time talking to those conservation groups that we have been talking to&mdash;the major conservation groups that have any interest in forests. After deliberation, after looking at the situation, I cannot find one that has got back to us to say that they are supporting what this government is doing, that they are supporting the new regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why the Democrat position eventually has been quite easy to make. We will be voting against this government's new regulations thanks to what the conservation groups have said to us about the open-endedness of these new regulations. For the minister to suggest that there is a problem going back to the old regulations because there is no ceiling, I would point out to him that there is no ceiling under the new regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government, like the previous government, has totally missed the point. The logging industry in our native forests is not sustainable. We are clearing and chipping at a record rate but, fortunately, we also have plantations coming on stream. Fortunately, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> despite the disincentives that this government is putting in the way, the plantation industry is beginning to thrive. Certainly Mount Gambier in my home state of South Australia has been thriving for quite some time in that area. But the native industry is not only going to run out of timber&mdash;you only have to look at the job losses, particularly in the areas I know in southern New South Wales and East Gippsland. The industry also is costing the taxpayer a huge amount of money, and it has long run out of any community support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we look at where these regulations are leading us, we see that there is very little support for what this government is continuing to do&mdash;that is, wholesale clearing of what little remains of our native forests. If you talk to people in many of the towns in rural areas that actually rely on native forests for their livelihoods, you will see bigger and bigger question marks appearing as they&mdash;particularly those in East Gippsland&mdash;realise that so many jobs have already gone because we are simply running out of timber. As tourism picks up in many of these areas they realise the long-term damage being done to their future, where their future really lies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you talk, as I have been doing recently, to those people in the plantation industry, those who are actually out there investing money, which is what the minister has just said he wants&mdash;this is where the real investment should be going&mdash;they are also disappointed at what this government is doing. You are encouraging a non&hyphen;sustainable, dying industry. By doing that you are actively discouraging the plantation industry and, to some extent, even farm forestry. Farmers are saying to us, `They are giving away native forests. What is the point of me dedicating some of my farmland to forest? Ten, 20 years down the track, if they are still giving away native forests, if there are any left, we have major concerns about whether or not we want to invest at that level.' So out there in the industry there are many people who are very exasperated at what this government is doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to look specifically at the disallowance motion. It certainly is a case of the devil and the deep blue sea. On the one hand, with the 1986 regulations, as has been pointed out, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4110"> we go back to an unlimited level of culling and to the usual ongoing brawl over licences. But at least that will all be out in public. At least we will be able to take part in it and we will actually be able to see what this government is doing. The 1996 regulations would also mean unlimited logging, unlimited licences, but by a much more circuitous route.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are no limits on woodchip licence tonnages set out in the 1986 regulations, but for all intents and purposes the so-called ceiling in the 1996 regulations is meaningless because of the loopholes. There are loopholes in the transitional licence tonnages, which already include an increase of one million tonnes in so-called `residual' woodchips&mdash;in other words, every possible habitat tree has gone now. And there are also loopholes in the unlimited licence tonnages available under the degraded forest licences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What do we mean by `degraded forest'? According to the new regulations, in relation to each forest to which the application applies, it is reliant on the general state of the forest and, in particular, whether the floristic composition of the forest has been altered significantly by reason of disease, weed infestation, harvesting and other human activities. In other words, if the farmers let the stock in and that stock takes out the understorey, they have probably taken out the vast majority of species, because there are only a few species that grow into tall mature trees in most districts and the bulk of the species are actually in the understorey.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I cannot imagine that we will have much problem at all for those who wish to chip what remains of their native woodlands. Just the very definition here in these regulations opens it up to wholesale action. It will be open slather. Where is this government's commitment to greenhouse? It talks about needing a carbon sink, it talks about planting a billion trees. Yet here we have the means by which we can effectively cut trees at 10 times the rate at which all the Landcare groups across this country are trying to plant trees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a huge problem in two states in particular. In Queensland we are looking at a greater amount of cutting. We saw 600,000 <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> hectares go last year in Queensland. We already have applications to clear&hyphen;fell over a million hectares. On top of the clear&hyphen;felling that is going on in many of our farming areas, if we include our woodlands and forests, we will see what real commitment this government has to the environment. It really is a sham.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, the definition of degraded land in the regulations is such that you could very easily drive a truck, or certainly thousands of chainsaws, through it. In Queensland I have had representations which estimate that 40 to 50 per cent of the forests which are being lined up for logging in that state are now on private land. Figures in Tasmania seem to be not quite as horrific, but Senator Brown could probably give you some figures on the amount of private forest that could be chipped under these new regulations. This really begins to show us how insidious these regulations are. If you add that to the existing level of woodchipping, to the existing level of clear&hyphen;felling&mdash;certainly in Queensland&mdash;you will see what horrific possibilities we have out there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to focus quickly on one clause, clause No. 8. This allows for not one but four different types of licences&mdash;transitional, degraded forests, RFAs, and restricted shipment. In each case there is a clause about the application of the licence and then a clause about the consideration of the application for the licence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the real comparison between the 1986 and the 1996 transitional licences. In the application for  transitional licence the applicant must specify the region from which a specified tonnage of hardwood woodchips will be derived and the tonnage of any woodchips derived from sawmill residues and silvicultural thinnings referred to as residue woodchips in the regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4111"> The 1996 regulations have a clause which states that, before deciding whether to grant a transitional licence, the minister may consider 12 matters. As well as the matters referred to in the 1986 regulations these include: the need to protect areas that are or may be required for the national reserve system; the desirability of encouraging invest ment in value added production forest and related industries; the possible economic and social effects of the decision to grant or refuse the application; the possible effects on the operations of the applicant of the decision to grant or refuse a licence and the applicant's record of adherence to export licence conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Surely, it is very strange that there is no requirement to consider these matters. After listening to Senator Hill I think this shows how transparent this government's arguments are. If there were any real commitment, there would be a requirement that all of these issues be taken into consideration before the decision on the application was made. This is one of the many major loopholes in the regulations, and I remind the government of what happened in December 1994 with Minister Beddall.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This clause must be amended. Obviously, if these regulations get through in this place, it cannot be, but if they are refused and the minister comes back with a much improved set, one of the improvements will be that there is a requirement to do all of those things. The way these regulations are written it appears that processing in Australia of woodchips derived from native forests will not be a priority and, in fact, may be positively discouraged. It is clear from the economic analysis of Australian Pulp and Paper Manufacturers that new pulp will be established only&mdash;and I repeat the word `only' for the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson)&mdash;in close proximity to substantial plantations. Native forests, it seems, for this industry, are going to have no major role in the future even if they are still required to supply some currently existing mills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I close by reiterating that the decision today will be a bad one for our precious native forests, whichever way the vote goes. It will mean that many million tonnes of our native forests will continue to be taken and that all of us, as taxpayers, will be continuing to subsidise an unsustainable industry. If this minister really wants investment, if he really wants to tackle our trade deficit in this area, he should be doing everything possible to encourage the plantation industry and putting <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> some barriers to the wholesale exploitation of our native forests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats will vote to disallow these new regulations. If the government takes these regulations away&mdash;after they are, I hope, defeated&mdash;I would recommend that, before bringing back any regulations to put in their place, they talk to economists and the plantation sector, and that they go back to the drawing board and bring some revised regulations that have also involved some genuine consultation with the environment movement.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Brown's approach to the issue of regulations governing the export of hardwood chips derived from native forests has hardly been surprising, given his ideological opposition to the commercial use of native forests&mdash;and, I might say, to just about any commercial operation that anyone wanted to start up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This approach is confirmed in the Native Forest Protection Bill 1996 introduced by Senator Brown on behalf of the Democrats, which aims to eliminate native forest logging and woodchip exports in favour of plantation. Fortunately, the bill will never see the light of day in the House of Representatives although Labor, as it continues to goosestep away from the national forest policy statement, may yet support it in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That the Australian Labor Party supports the motion of disallowance is ample evidence that its rhetoric about jobs is totally and utterly hollow. The regulations provide certainty for a key part of the native forest logging industry, and the importance of this should not be underestimated after the damage caused by the illogical and commercially inept approach adopted by Labor. I could not help but note in the closing remarks of Senator Lees that she said that it did not matter which way the vote went, it was going to be bad; and then she said she would support the disallowance. Really bizarre stuff, I have to tell you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These regulations plot a sensible, practical transitional approach to dealing with woodchip exports as we negotiate with the states to put in place regional agreements over the next three years. For the past week, Senator Brown <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4112"> has been running the line that the government is attempting to push through new unlimited woodchip export licences. First of all he was saying when the previous regulations were disallowed that there would be unlimited licences; now he is objecting to the regulations that are before us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He has supported his arguments with statements that he has issued in recent weeks implying that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) was on the verge of approving export licences of 10 million tonnes of woodchips. This is patently untrue. Senator, you are loose with the truth. Senator Brown has not let the facts get in the way of a good, emotive scare campaign. In fact, he reminds me of ratbags years ago who used to wander around outside theatres saying. `Repent. The end is nigh.' They used to be brave enough to put a time and date on it, and when the time came and went and the end of the world did not happen they were bitterly disappointed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now Senator Brown seeks to disallow regulations which impose a ceiling on woodchip exports for native forest regions which are not covered by regional forest agreements. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> of 10 September reports Senator Brown as saying that he would vote to disallow the regulations so that the government would have to take responsibility for each decision on logging rather than have it ratified by the parliament. The Commonwealth makes no decision on logging. Senator Brown should be aware that unsuccessful applicants for export licences have the right to appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and that unsuccessful applicants may appeal such decisions to the tribunal which, if these regulations are disallowed, will not be constrained by any export ceiling. Much of Senator Brown's criticism of woodchip exports is based on the misconception that the granting of an export licence somehow gives the licence holder a right to harvest the material.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is simply not the case, as the responsibility for land use management, including the management of forests, lies directly with the state governments. We must move away from this incorrect perception, fostered by the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> previous government, that export licences offer protection for the environmental and heritage values of our forests. They do not. The licences confer on exporters the right to export pulpwood; they do not confer the right to harvest. Harvesting may occur in any place and the wood may be processed within Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are no Commonwealth controls on the domestic use of this material, nor are there controls on the export of processed wood such as sawn timber and paper. The Resource Assessment Commission stated in its 1992 report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the question of woodchip exports should be considered separately from forest management practices. If the main point of concern is that logging practices associated with the production of woodchips from native forests are unacceptable on ecological or other grounds, it would be more effective to control those practices directly or to implement a different system of land use, rather than impose export sanctions or intervene in established commercial activities.</PARA>
<PARA>In the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Adding Further Value to Australia's Forest Products</EMPHASIS>  of September 1993, the Industry Commission states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some perceive the export controls as a means of pursuing environmental objectives. However, environmental objectives are more efficiently addressed by measures which impinge on all logging operations (eg. codes of logging practice), not just logging operations associated with the production of logs and woodchips destined for export markets.</PARA>
<PARA>Given the states' role as forest managers, the most appropriate way to ensure forest values, including environmental and production values, are protected is under agreements between the Commonwealth and the states. The government, therefore, remains committed to the national forest policy statement and its central goals of creating a world&hyphen;class forest reserve system and providing long-term security for native forest based industries in the context of ecological and economic sustainability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are much the same words that Senator Hill used in his speech. I think those on the opposition side have to suddenly wake up. This is 1996. We have a coalition government in power. And you know what? Surprise, surprise&mdash;we talk to one another. As Senator <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4113"> Hill said, not only did the previous government not talk to one another; their staff did not talk to one another.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have taken a whole of government approach to the process of government because we believe we were elected for all Australians and not just a narrow group. We recognise the Labor Party's sectional interest. They are the political arm of the trade union movement. They make no bones about it. And of course the minority parties tend to compete for the same narrow sectional group. Hence, we cannot have the Greens moving a motion in here or putting forward some sort of proposal without the Democrats coming in and saying, `Me, too.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe the goals will be achieved through regional forest agreements between the Commonwealth and states. The commitment of this government to the sustainable management of the forest reserve is demonstrated by the provision of an extra $48 million for accelerating the RFA process. The comprehensive regional assessments leading to RFAs will be accelerated without compromising the integrity of the process to achieve a lasting solution to the forest policy impasse of the past decade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Large areas of forests which might be needed to establish a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system are now protected under the deferred forest agreements and interim forest agreements with the states. Industry is restricted to harvesting in areas approved by the former Labor government under deferred and interim forest agreements. These agreements identify all areas that might be required by a CAR reserve system, and the states have agreed not to harvest in those areas either for export or for domestic use.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This agreement not to harvest those possible CAR reserve areas is of much more conservation value than a ban on the export of pulpwood after the trees have been harvested. RFAs will be negotiated to ensure that a CAR reserve system is established and that harvesting outside those areas is done in an ecologically sustainable manner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recently sat through the estimates hearings where Senator Brown questioned officials in relation to potential domestic use of wood <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that is currently exported. The government recognises medium&hyphen; to long&hyphen;term supply security is a critical issue for the industry. The decisions of the former Labor government created a great deal of uncertainty for the forest based industries and the communities dependent on those industries. Many billions of dollars principally for value adding projects in fibre board, wood pulp and paper production would be invested by the forest industries if they were certain about long-term government policy direction and the security of resource supply, enabling more woodchips to be utilised domestically.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It must be recognised that the pulpwood that is being exported as woodchips is entirely unsuitable for producing products such as furniture or other sawn timber products. It is, however, entirely suitable for production of printing grade paper, and the export market therefore offers the highest return for this valuable resource. There is certainly no evidence that any domestic processor which requires pulpwood for its operations has ever been lacking in material. The regulations to which we will revert if this motion is successful, the old unprocessed wood regulations which predated Labor's ill-conceived arrangements, which were disallowed by the House of Representatives, are adequate to implement the government's transitional woodchip licensing policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard a lot about forest policy from Labor Party shadow ministers since the election, but what we have heard particularly in relation to regulations is they have not learnt any lessons. They have failed to see that the states are absolutely committed to the national forest policy statement, that it is in their interests to get regional forest agreements in place and the Commonwealth out of their hair. Yet, instead of working with the states in a spirit of cooperative federalism, they have treated them with disdain and introduced the ill-conceived woodchip export regulations disallowed recently by the coalition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps the most pernicious feature of these regulations was the two-stage licensing process under which the volume of woodchips allowed to be exported from any state was <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4114"> slashed if the states failed to achieve agreed milestones towards implementing regional forest agreements. The government recognises that we must set deadlines for the implementation of national forest agreements. But punitive approaches such as those adopted by Labor are simply counterproductive. We have set some boundaries for our negotiations with the states. The regulations currently before the Senate will ensure that from 1 January 2000 woodchip exports will not be permitted from areas not covered by regional forest agreements. The states understand this condition is immoveable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I wish to make the point that the government is not trying to mislead the public into believing that all woodchip exports from our forests will cease in the year 2000. Woodchips will continue to be exported under regional forest agreements as part of an integrated, sustainable and internationally competitive native forest logging industry. The previous government's position was precisely the same. If it has changed, they should have the courage to come out and say so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the government recognises this decision on forest policy has not met the demands of all stakeholders, it is a firm and balanced decision consistent with its recognition of the regard that all Australians have for our forests for their outstanding natural qualities and source of sustainable employment and wealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new regulations introduced by this government were not greeted by the outcry that accompanied the making of Labor's ill-conceived and illogical regulations in November last year. In fact they have been broadly welcomed by the community and, in particular, by communities in which people's livelihood depends directly upon an ecologically sustainable timber industry. I urge all senators to vote against this motion before us today.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to present some of the aspects of the current government's policies as they affect Western Australia. That includes the fact that, in response to the green light given by the Howard government, and I am quoting from information provided by the Western Australian Conservation Council, the WA native forest woodchip exporters Wesfarmers Bunnings and Whittakers have applied for an effective 41 per cent increase in their total woodchip export quotas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The federal Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) has already restored the 20 per cent reduction in woodchip export quotas made by the Keating government at the end of last year. Under the Howard government's woodchip regulations, the companies have applied for licences for three years instead of one year, as in the past. That will take them from 1 January 1997 to 31 December 1999. According to the Conservation Council, this increase would raise WA's native forest woodchip exports from 860,000 tonnes a year to 1,210,000 tonnes a year, mostly from old&hyphen;growth kauri and marri trees.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you. There are issues involved with forests as a value other than just commercial value, but that seems to be lost on the government at the moment. For instance, it has been indicated that the current regional forest agreement process would allow old&hyphen;growth forest to be stripped for cheap export woodchips, when these rare and diminishing forests are needed for WA's rapidly expanding tourism industry. To whom are we providing security and to whom are we concentrating on providing jobs? The other industries have not been brought into this equation. The other industries have been locked out of this equation&mdash;small business, tourism.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously there are other values in the forest, but just exactly to whom are we providing security? There are many industries certainly in Western Australia that actually require old&hyphen;growth forest as part of their resource security. So it is a very, very, very selective use of resource security in an industry which has been shedding jobs steadily over the years as it has become more and more capital intensive. It does not take a lot of workers to feed enormous logs through a chipper. Obviously it takes more workers to produce value added goods, and that is why the economics are such&mdash;volume rather than value often gets the nod in this industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today both ministers approved the forest assessment process, especially the environment minister who endorsed it. Concern has been expressed by the Western Australia</PARA>
<PARA>Forest Alliance that forest assessment in Western Australia has been closed and manipulated by a predetermined outcome by the department of conservation and land management by a predetermined outcome. Fundamental, in the opinion of the forest alliance, to the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> success of the process are: the steering committee; access to data; full involvement of scientists; and the use of benchmarks and criteria in a proper fashion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me just tell you what access there is to scientific information in Western Australia. Dennis Saunders&mdash;not a radical person&mdash;who is head of CSIRO's wildlife ecology division wrote a 300&hyphen;page report which had a couple of paragraphs indicating that cockatoos needed hollows in trees that need at least 150 years to develop. Since then the head of conservation and land management has not ceased to attack the head of CSIRO wildlife for daring to question their policies. There is no scientific freedom in Western Australia on forest information that can be published because of effective control by the department of conservation and land management on anything published on the issue. Yet this information certainly does not exist at the moment in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Western Australian Forest Alliance also indicated that CALM and the state government have repeatedly said that WA already fully complies with all Commonwealth benchmarks and requirements for forest conservation. We have found out&mdash;and Senator Brown has made very clear in the Senate estimates process&mdash;that when it comes to abiding by federal conditions, as pointed out by ex&hyphen;Senator Chamarette in years gone by, firstly, no&hyphen;one was looking after who abided by the conditions; and, secondly, when a reporting process was implemented because of the questions we asked, the reports came back showing that government officials had gone to the companies asking them whether they were abiding by the conditions and the companies replied, `Yes, of course we are', and that is what went in the report. There are verified examples in a number of states where people wrote to the government saying, `These are the examples where conditions are not being met.' These were not fully reported. This shows you just how faulty this process is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Western Australian Forest Alliance also indicated, on the regional forest agreement, that the Conservation Council of Western Australia Inc. is reported to have prepared a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4116"> critique of the regional forest assessment process as it currently operates. They believe that the following crucial reforms are needed for it to have any integrity or credibility: conservation council representatives should be on the steering committee; full access for council representatives to all databases and methodologies used by CALM and the Commonwealth; full involvement of members of the independent scientific community&mdash;and I just mentioned why that is not the case in Western Australia; and continuation of the moratorium on National Estate forests which under the deferred forest agreement are to be handed over for logging at the end of 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The industry and union information about the need to lift quotas to use up waste wood is, in fact, misinformation. The woodchip industry is based on clear&hyphen;felling. It is a waste&hyphen;creating industry and it has only ever been&mdash;also according to the Western Australian Conservation Council&mdash;interested in taking the best quality logs it can get its hands on to provide 90 per cent of its resource. The figures are there on how much clear&hyphen;felled forests are being chipped&mdash;very high figures on Karri forests. In excess of 80 per cent of those clear&hyphen;felled forests go into the chipper. If that is a waste product, you have to wonder what is done with the 15 per cent or 20 per cent that is left which makes the 80 per cent or 85 per cent worth wasting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Huge issues are involved here. We heard today that there will be no limits on exports from private land. What does that make of the government's new&hyphen;found concern for the environment on the Telstra sale bill? What does that mean? How many Telstras can you sell for every bit of water, land and resource that you degrade when private land gets the nod, the go&hyphen;ahead for export woodchips? What kind of environmental concern is this?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Should the environment minister, as he indicated in his speech, be an advocate primarily for the forest industry? I do not believe that that would fit the description by anybody in the community who had an idea of the job description for a minister for the environment. We are all concerned about outcomes for regional development. But, as I indicated, there is no real integrated concern about total <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> employment outcomes with these kinds of policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Add to that that $100 million annually as a minimum is a subsidy to the forest industries in Australia with only around $&half; billion total exports of forest products and you get the real picture of the economics of this industry. It is highly subsidised, it is job&hyphen;shedding and it is putting many more jobs at risk by its very process of removing the resource security for those industries in regional Australia which really can be sustainable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the motion to the Senate. It is very sad that this motion of disallowance has to be moved. But it is also very important that the government get the message that they cannot push around the real concerns of the Australian community and get away with it. And only the government will be responsible for the outcome of such a dreadful performance in the environment, especially in relation to our native forests.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too would like to join in this debate. I will have a little message for you&mdash;through you, Mr Acting Deputy President&mdash;in a little while in terms of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first point that I touch on is this: I make it quite clear in relation to the statement put out today by Senator Brown&mdash;what I call the politics of envy&mdash;that it is absolutely true that I do have some shares in Wesfarmers. I am very, very proud that I have some shares in Wesfarmers. If that means I have to declare an interest, I will declare an interest. Nonetheless, I am still going to vote on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth making a few comments about this in terms of Wesfarmers and what a great company Wesfarmers has been for Western Australia and Australia. In particular, if there is a bastion or a light that we can hold up there in terms of the cooperative movement, Wesfarmers is that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I took out my shares many years ago, when I first got a new land block in Jerdacuttup in about 1962, when I had absolutely no money. I was living in a shed with three tin walls and a leaky roof and a dirt floor. A whole host of us, including me, found a few hundred dollars each to take out some shares in WFSL, so that we could keep Wesfarmers Superphosphates Ltd in Western Australia. That is what we did at that time and we are all very proud of that and very proud of the cooperative movement. Wesfarmers has grown over the years. It eventually bought out the other two&hyphen;thirds of CSBP and, after the growth of the cooperative movement, they also took out a shareholding in Bunnings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not on top of the exact detail of that aspect, but my little investment at that time was a very important investment alongside those of many other West Australian farmers, both those who were established and those of us who were new land farmers. Let me tell you that it was damned hard to find those dollars and cents as an investment in our industry, when we were denying ourselves the petrol that we needed to go to town once a week or some other aspects or family requirements. I think that Wesfarmers needs to be <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> congratulated. I will be keeping my investment in Wesfarmers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us just talk a little more about some aspects of Wesfarmers so we can get a perspective on it. The woodchipping operation of Wesfarmers is a by&hyphen;product of its value adding process in its operations or in Bunnings Wesfarmers. It has an investment of some $60 million in that value adding arrangement and it is a whole&hyphen;of&hyphen;forest approach. With regard to on&hyphen;farm or private plantation developments, within the last five years they have invested approximately $20 million and developed about 17,000 hectares of plantation forests in Western Australia and would expect that 50 per cent of their woodchips would come from the plantations in approximately seven years&mdash;that is, by the year 2003.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard in this chamber, in just over six years that I have been in here, continual pleas and bleatings from people who sat on the other side about private developments in plantations as far as the forest industry is concerned. I think Wesfarmers is a company that has put its money where its mouth is, and we will find by the year 2003 that approximately 50 per cent of its woodchips will come from plantations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We just heard, as usual, Senator Margetts come into this place and denigrate her own state. She does it every time you hear a debate here. She just criticises, whereas Western Australia has a very proud record in forest management. CALM has been a very successful organisation and I want to touch on one or two other things with regard to them in due course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4118"> Let us look at the position now in Western Australia. There are approximately 60,000 hectares of plantations being developed, both privately and by CALM. This is increasing by 15,000 hectares per annum, something that I hope Senator Brown would at least applaud, even if we are not likely to get any applause out of Senator Margetts. The plan is that by the year 2000, the plantation crop in WA will have grown to 100,000 hectares, which will mean development of export revenue of approximately $200 million. It has the poten tial of reaching 200,000 hectares of plantation before saturation point is reached.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One could go on making reference to these points. Because of the foresight of state governments&mdash;and I underline `state governments' because it has been both the coalition and also, following that, the Labor government in Western Australia&mdash;there has been a large development of the plantations in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now turn to the woodchip export licensing regime, having made reference to my position as far as Wesfarmers is concerned. While it continues to reinvest into industry in Western Australia, I will continue to proudly be a shareholder. The first point I would like to make about the woodchip export licensing regime has already been made but it needs re-emphasising. The current ceiling of 5.251 million tonnes applying to woodchips will continue. The most remarkable thing we have heard so far in this debate is that those opposite intend to vote these regulations down and have no ceiling at all. It is absolutely unbelievable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can understand Senator Brown's position. I cannot understand the position of the Democrats on this issue having listened to them in the debate. Least of all, I cannot understand Labor's position, especially considering the trouble the Labor government got themselves into some 12 months ago with the blockade on Parliament House by people who were involved directly and indirectly in the industry protesting about the handling of this particular issue by the previous government. They were protesting about ministers Beddall and Faulkner in particular.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We heard the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Faulkner, today give one of the most inept speeches I have ever heard. I am sure when he goes home and reads that particular speech in due course or is reminded of it, he will regret ever making it. As Senator Hill stated in his speech, it was Senator Collins who had to come in and intervene. Maybe the real agenda of the Labor Party, in an endeavour to win back some of the support they lost from the union movement during that particular debacle, is not to have any ceiling whatsoever. That could be their real <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> intent, but they are not prepared to say it. They are not prepared to be honest about it. All they do is twerp across the chamber about particular aspects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will be interesting to see what further speakers from the Labor Party have to say about this particular regulation and the position that they have adopted. Some of them might think&mdash;although they are not likely to do it&mdash;that the best thing to do is to adopt a sensible approach as we have done and cross the floor and vote with us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point I would like to make regarding the new woodchip export licensing regime is that an additional quantity of one million tonnes of woodchips are to be sourced exclusively from sawmill residues and silvicultural thinnings from regrowth forests. It has always amazed me that previously this timber that is now going to be utilised was left to either rot on the forest floor or was burnt. This exacerbated our greenhouse problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We hear much from the other side of this chamber about greenhouse gases. There were actions that they could have taken in government many years ago that would have created a more prosperous timber industry, would have meant better control and management in the forests and would have minimised some of the effect of greenhouse gasses in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point on silvicultural thinnings is worth dwelling on for a moment. We hear people getting angry about clear felling and saying things which they do not understand. If you talk to any forester or any responsible conservationist&mdash;and there are many of them around&mdash;they will tell you that the best way to re&hyphen;establish a native forest on land that has been utilised for timber production is to clear fell it and then replant with a species or allow seed trees to stay there or to allow regeneration. It depends on the circumstances, the species and rainfall. I have seen all of these three different options in practice in different areas in Western Australia where there has been magnificent re&hyphen;establishment of forest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A picture comes to mind where in the early days some areas of karri forest was cut out. There was no additional felling and the karri <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4119"> forest did not re&hyphen;establish because the little seedlings growing there could not compete with the forest floor that was left. So the karri forest was not re&hyphen;established. Today some of these areas are being clear&hyphen;felled for the purpose of re&hyphen;establishing the karri forest that used to exist in the 1800s because it has the soil type, the rainfall and the various environmental requirements to re&hyphen;establish the particular forest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third point is the case by case basis approval for the export of woodchips sourced from the clearing of degraded private forests for the establishment of hardwood plantations. I want to underline the word `hardwood'. I am very proud to have been involved in establishing the on&hyphen;farm forest policy in Western Australia in a previous life when I was with the farmers federation in Western Australia. This was done in consultation with many people in the industry but in particular with two ministers in the Western Australian  government. One was the Hon. Dick Old, who was the Minister for Agriculture in the then Liberal government, and the other one was the Hon. Julian Grill, who was the Minister for Agriculture in the Labor Party at that particular time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Through that process we developed an on-farm forest plantation policy which was designed to rehabilitate private land and degraded areas in Western Australia. We have heard phrases thrown around here today such as `You can go in there and virtually slash and burn.' What a load of nonsense! If people had studied at all the clearing control regime which exists in Western Australia on private land, they would know that you cannot do that. They would know that there are very strict regulations in place to get a clearing permit, such as you have to go back and plant appropriate species there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If people had studied the regime at all, they would know that it took a court case down at Rocky Gully with Mr Henderson to win the right to clear degraded forest in the water catchment clearing control areas and to replant it with similar hardwood types. They would know that the advantages of doing that include a significant lowering of the water table and hence the improvement of the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> salinity outcomes, the control of wind erosion and a range of other real and sustainable environmental advantages. They would also know that, if the forest was allowed to remain in its degraded state&mdash;there were a variety of reasons why it became degraded, and I will touch on a couple of those in a minute&mdash;it would eventually die out and be overtaken by introduced species.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We heard mention made of the various bird species and wildlife. I would like to make a particular point by referring to the experience on my own farm where the highest bush was about a metre high. We planted strips of trees by drilling seed through the combine seed boxes. We now have birds such as blue ground parrots, galahs and butcherbirds, and we now have animals such as carpet snakes, bush rats and possums in there. The point is that none of those animals were there prior to this planting taking place. I get heartily sick and tired of sitting here and listening to those opposite virtually saying that private land-holders are environmental vandals in the development of this government policy. If you look at what is happening, you would see that the absolute reverse is the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the speakers here today said that this part of the regulations would be detrimental to the landcare program. I say quite categorically that it will be very beneficial to the landcare program. At the same time as these regulations will allow the land to be cleaned up and degraded forest to be restored to commercial and environmental value by being replanted with species that are suitable to the areas, we will find that those areas will also be fenced out and looked after. I can say quite clearly that if my father and I, when I was growing up, had known the importance of fencing in protecting particular areas, you would have seen a very different landscape today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But to have people from the other side of this chamber, such as Senator Brown, decrying what is being done now and opposing this particular aspect of the regulations shows quite clearly that they do not understand many of the existing issues that need to be resolved to develop what is required for the future from the point of view of the long-term <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4120"> sustainability of our timber industry, of our comprehensive and representative reserve systems, and of getting native species of hardwoods back onto private land which has been cleared.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I emphasise once again that it is absolutely remarkable to have a disallowance motion in front of us that will totally lift the ceiling off woodchipping in this nation. This is about as irresponsible as you could become in dealing with this aspect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I attended a number of the meetings on this issue with industry representatives and with people from all walks of life. I particularly want to refer to Alec Marr, whom the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate chose to get stuck into and call a sucker. Let me tell the Senate that, particularly at the meeting which the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) chaired, Alec Marr made a very positive and strong contribution. I congratulate him for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will wind up by referring to the speech made by Senator Margetts when she stated that there is no scientific freedom in Western Australia. That is totally wrong. It is an incorrect statement. If people like me can go along and obtain scientific research information that shows some of the work that is being done in Western Australia when we are dealing with this issue of the joint management of the forests, then anyone can. I would like to bring to the attention of people in the chamber and in the gallery documents such as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">It is back: the return of the woylie</EMPHASIS>, which is a very interesting little story about the multiple uses of forests and what is being done there with the fox baiting program. I would also mention the coexistence of the tourism industry with the forest industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This publication known as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Western Shield</EMPHASIS> gives us some scientific information on the work that is being done in conservation. The work is all very positive, all very comprehensive and all very detailed. It is being done in such a manner that I am sure that, as we move into the next century, not only will the woylie come off the endangered species list in Western Australia but so will a number of the other 16 animals cited in the list contained in this document, such as the bilby, the dibbler, and the brush&hyphen;tailed possum. This is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a subject  I could talk on for a lot longer because there is a lot in it but I will wind up my comments by making an appeal to this chamber to see the responsible approach taken by these regulations. It will lead us into the year 2000 with the various developments required for the forest industries. It is a responsible approach to forest development and it is linked very closely to other multiple forest and land uses. In particular, these regulations provide a real incentive&mdash;I will make this point over and over again&mdash;for private land&hyphen;holders to redevelop and re&hyphen;establish hardwoods on private land where hardwood forests have been degraded for a variety of reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, to re&hyphen;emphasise the point, I say once again to Senator Brown, through you Mr Acting Deputy President, that I am very proud of my shares in Wesfarmers. I am very proud of that company for what it has done for the State of Western Australia. It continues its process of vertical integration and developing its private plantations.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak in favour of the disallowance of the Howard government's iniquitous new woodchip export regulations. Much was made in the previous address of ceilings. In my view, the ceiling referred to is a false one. Talking about a ceiling in the government regulations is cynical and manipulative. It is a ceiling so far above any reasonable assessment of what is sustainable from our forests that no practical benefit can be construed from it as a ceiling. It is simply public relations rhetoric.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These new government regulations pave the way for disaster, not only for publicly owned and privately owned native forests but also for the timber industry itself&mdash;in particular, for the emerging plantation&hyphen;based timber industry. The regulations move in a direction directly opposite to that which is required in order to sustain development in regional Australia and to sustain the fastest growing industry in the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4121"> forest region of south&hyphen;west Western Australia&mdash;tourism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The native forest woodchip industry is in a rush to sell off the native forest woodchips now because those woodchips are, as Judy Clark and others have said, of relatively poor quality and will soon be displaced by better quality plantation chips from around the world. In drafting and gazetting these regulations, the government has collaborated with the native forest woodchip industry to enable them to strip our old&hyphen;growth native forests in these last few years before the woodchips will not be able to be given away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These new regulations are a significant step along the path of the deregulation of the woodchip industry in particular and the timber industry in general. This deregulation at a Commonwealth government level is part of its plan to remove itself entirely, or as much as possible, from any area of environmental control or regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under these woodchip regulations, and in association with the regional forest agreement process, the Commonwealth is trying to wash its hands of the forests and the issuing of woodchip export licences. It will then be down to the states to control, monitor and regulate, if they choose to&mdash;and their record so far is almost universally appalling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These woodchip regulations will either give rise to or fail to prevent the following harmful and regressive outcomes. There will be substantial increases in the volume of export woodchips from native forests both publicly and privately owned. There will be increased or continued logging of old&hyphen;growth forest to produce mainly woodchips. There will be increased or continuing encouragement to the woodchip industry to consume large volumes of old&hyphen;growth forest logs which could and should be used to produce sawn timber for high quality timber products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be increased or continuing pressure to allocate old&hyphen;growth native forest to timber production rather than other more benign and labour intensive uses, such as tourism. There will be increased incentive to export plantation wood as woodchips or whole logs rather than encouraging downstream processing. There will be ongoing <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> entrenchment and subsidisation of the native forest timber industry at the expense of the far more sustainable plantation&hyphen;based timber industry. And there will be ministerial intervention on behalf of the environment becoming almost entirely discretionary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Already, in expectation of these new regulations, in my own state of Western Australia the woodchip exporters of Wesfarmers Bunnings and Whittakers have applied for an effective 41 per cent increase in their total woodchip export quotas. It should be noted that at least one of these companies is a major contributor to the coalition political parties to the tune of thousands of dollars annually while being a beneficiary of these new regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These same companies have been and continue to be in breach of legally binding state and Commonwealth conditions. In 1994 an official Commonwealth investigation found that Wesfarmers Bunnings was likely to have breached its woodchip export conditions in relation to the logging of the magnificent old&hyphen;growth karri forests in the Giblett block near Pemberton.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another official investigation is currently under way in relation to claims from a Western Australian sawmill operator that third&hyphen;grade sawlogs are being sent to the woodchip mill to be used for woodchips. This is a further breach of legally binding conditions under the state agreement which, in turn, are incorporated into the woodchip licence conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The WA Department of Environmental Protection has recently reported that Whittakers, through its subsidiary Southern Plantations Chip Company, has not complied with state conditions on its export woodchip operations. We have an ongoing record of failure to comply with the letter, let alone the spirit, of woodchip export licences and agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4122">  Like the majority&mdash;and I stress `majority'&mdash;of people from my home state of Western Australia, I am opposed to the ongoing massive level of clear&hyphen;felling operations taking place in WA's unique old&hyphen;growth karri and jarrah forests. Each year, according to WA government figures, WA is losing be tween 10,000 and 15,000 hectares of old&hyphen;growth forests to clear&hyphen;felling and other forms of intensive logging operations. The Resource Assessment Commission inquiry into the timber industry stated in its 1992 final report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The logging of old growth forests potentially violates the precautionary principle in that an irreplaceable resource is being destroyed.</PARA>
<PARA>Contrary to woodchip industry misinformation, old&hyphen;growth forests are not a renewable resource. They are being wiped out and they will not return. Despite the self-serving manipulation&mdash;and I stress `manipulation'&mdash;of definitions that the industry and government persist with, it is well understood that there are qualities and attributes unique to old&hyphen;growth forests that arise from their pristineness and their continuity over the ages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> These qualities and attributes cannot and do not survive the massive assault that the modern industrial forestry business brings to bear with its combination of roading, clear&hyphen;felling, burning, poisoning, application of chemicals, alteration of species and genetic compositions, permanent impacts on aquatic ecosystems and the introduction or spread of weeds, diseases and feral animals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Contrary to woodchip industry misinformation, the woodchip industry is not and never has been a residue industry. Most of the wood that is produced from the clear&hyphen;felling operations in WA's old&hyphen;growth karri and jarrah forests goes to woodchips. Only a relatively small proportion actually ends up as sawn timber. For example, for the year 1993&mdash;which was a typical year&mdash;WA produced 231,000 cubic metres of sawn timber from native forests and 815,000 cubic metres of woodchips from native forests. How could 815,000 be a residue of 231,000? I say again that it is not and never has been the case that the woodchip industry is a residue industry coming along and politely cleaning up the leftovers from sawlog operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The WA woodchip industry uses mainly whole logs, not branches and sawmill offcuts as industry and government misinformation seeks to suggest. In 1994, for example, 90 per cent of the input was in the form of whole logs and just 10 per cent was sawmill resi dues. In that same year&mdash;and the situation is probably worse now, given the slump in demand for sawn timber&mdash;45 per cent of all logs taken from WA's native forests went straight to the chipper. It is rape, and rape in a big way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The reason the woodchipping industry is so desperate to hang on to its privileged access to Australia's old&hyphen;growth native forests is simple: it is a very profitable industry. The reason it is very profitable is that it consumes very large volumes of good quality whole logs which it gets very cheaply from our forests, courtesy of the governments to which they make political donations. It expends almost nothing in terms of labour and processing costs, and then sells the chips to Japan at a very handsome profit per unit volume and sells to other foreign countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Even though the per unit volume value of woodchips may well be less than the per unit volume value of sawn timber, when the huge volumes produced and the very large profit margins per unit volume are taken into consideration it is easy to see why massive quantities of logs that could be used to produce sawn timber are used, instead, to produce woodchips.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> We have had various reports in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> about woodchipping of those logs in July this year. It is the woodchip industry, not sawn timber production, which drives the logging of WA's old&hyphen;growth native forests. The big woodchip companies, such as Wesfarmers&hyphen;Bunnings in WA, never reveal how much profit they make from woodchips as opposed to sawn timber. They only ever talk in terms of the per unit volume value of woodchips versus sawn timber. There is a conspiracy of silence between the government and those companies as to the real facts of the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4123"> As I have explained, this gives a deliberately false impression of the real overall profitablilty of woodchipping versus sawn timber production. It is because woodchipping drives the native forest industry that we see little or no decrease in the level of logging in our native forests at a time when there is a long&hyphen;term slump in sawn timber demand. In WA the state government has a legally bind ing commitment to supply Wesfarmers&hyphen;Bunnings with 680,000 tonnes of logs suitable for woodchipping every year. This means that even if sawlogs or sawn timber are not required or cannot be sold, the supply of chip logs must be and is maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The entrenchment of the woodchip industry in old&hyphen;growth native forests, which these new regulations will facilitate, leaves the way open for ongoing direct conflict with the needs of the tourism industry in WA. Tourism industry reports and industry operators point out that too little has been done and is being done to provide a secure base for the tourism industry of the south&hyphen;west of WA. The industry recognises and acknowledges that the old&hyphen;growth forests of the region are a crucial feature that it depends on for its future growth, sustainability and attractiveness as an environment. That is why people come to Australia&mdash;for the environment. They do not come to Australia to look at sawmill logs in woodchip factories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Many of the south&hyphen;west's most spectacular and high conservation value old&hyphen;growth forests are, under existing state government plans, destined for clear&hyphen;felling and woodchipping. Forests like Sharpe, Jane and Giblett, and many more, are scheduled for destruction. With less than 20 per cent of WA's native forests in secure dedicated conservation reserves, the industry&mdash;I refer to the tourism industry and the plantation timber industry&mdash;have good reason to be concerned. Although the regional forest agreement process is supposed to investigate these issues, as far as WA is concerned that process has itself been taken over by a state government which has repeatedly stated that almost no more forest is required for conservation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The Howard government makes some claims about regional development and employment. Minister Sharp is on record as identifying the government's commitment to woodchipping as a key element in its approach to regional development. I refer to a media statement from John Sharp, dated 20 August 1996. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a new woodchip export licensing system which will allow for an additional 1 million tonnes of woodchip to be sourced from sawmill residues, all <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> provide evidence of this Government's commitment to rural Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>The shareholders of Wesfarmers and Bunnings do not live in rural Australia. I can tell the government that the WA woodchip industry, despite the massive quantities of forests and logs it consumes, is a very low employer. The entire industry directly employs only about 200 people. The tourism industry in the Pemberton region alone is fast reaching this number of employees. That&mdash;and I refer to the tourism industry&mdash;is the industry of the future for the south&hyphen;west. That is the industry that can provide for long&hyphen;term jobs and regional economic well&hyphen;being.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Encouragement of a sustainable nature based tourism industry in combination with encouragement of a large plantation and farm forest based timber and pulp industry is the best way to ensure the environmental economic and social future of the south&hyphen;west of WA, not the creation of a wasteland of trees. If the Howard government is really interested in regional development, then protecting old growth forests rather than consigning them to woodchipping oblivion is a far more fruitful policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am strongly opposed to these new regulations which will serve only one purpose; the favouring of the entrenchment of native forest woodchipping at the expense of every other community concern and potential benefit, including those of our new industries such as tourism. The government appears to have completely misunderstood the costs of woodchipping and the opportunities provided by other forms of other industry development. It needs to go away and have a good long think about its priorities, not about its mates, and then come back to this place with a set of regulations that will discourage woodchipping of native forests and, instead, encourage timber industry development outside old growth forests. The government needs to demonstrate that it has developed a far more sophisticated understanding of this issue, not merely an understanding of its political debts, rather than simply offering these completely inadequate and inappropriate regulations as a gesture of political support to its mates in their beleaguered and greedy woodchip industry.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Here we are again. I have been in this place for nine years and I do not know how many times this woodchip and forestry debate has come up. You get the same old rhetoric and the colourful language&mdash;bulldozers, chainsaws, slash and burn&mdash;and the same confusion in the debate. I thought these regulations that have been put together by the government, after consultation with industry and environmental groups, were very practical regulations. The fact that they build on the national forest policy statement and provide incentives for all the states to achieve the regional forest agreements that everybody&mdash;particularly those in the Labor Party&mdash;has been talking about for so long would ensure that we ended up by the year 2000 with a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system in place across our nation's forests.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a lot of talk tonight, particularly from the Australian Democrats, about plantation timbers. In these regulations there is a category of degraded forests which will allow those degraded forests to be made into some more productive plantation forests. I know that in my own state of Tasmania, for instance, Norths are trying to bring forward their tree planting program from five years to two years; and they want extra woodchipping so that the old trees they take away will be replaced with the new plantations. Mr Acting Deputy President, you would know all about this in your area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those plantation timbers will provide jobs for Tasmanians. They will raise the resource of that plantation timber so that perhaps further down the track there will be a total plantation resource base. There is a proposed Taiwanese pulp and paper mill for Tasmania with downstream processing. They are the sorts of things that it has been interesting to note over a period of time the Tasmanian Greens have been talking about for plantation timber. They have been talking about sustainable forestry and downstream processing yet every time someone tries to improve on the process we end up with the same impasse&mdash;disallowing regulations and trying to stop it.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must admit that the forestry processes in Tasmania at the moment are certainly better than they were 10, 15, 20 or 30 years ago and a lot of that has been brought about by concerns raised by the green movement. I have to say that; but how far do you go? When is it ever going to stop? As Barry Chipman, the State Coordinator of the Forest Protection Society in Tasmania, said on 22 September 1996 the new Tasmanian timber community welcomed the new woodchipping export regulations. The industry in Tasmania is the lifeblood of thousands of hardworking people who depend on the timber industry and are well aware of the need to maintain it as an ongoing resource. As Mr Chipman concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Political pointscoring with the regulations can only be to appease extreme minority groups who can never be satisfied.</PARA>
<PARA>I am sure that a vast majority of those people who live in rural and regional Australia, particularly in my own state of Tasmania, would say that enough is enough. In my short time in this place there have been something like 23 inquiries into forestry. You would know all about that, Senator Murphy. You have been involved in the toings&hyphen;and&hyphen;froings on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thought that this time when we got to these regulations that have been put together in consultation with the industry and the environment movement that, perhaps, commonsense would prevail but, no, here we go again. I listened with interest, prior to the election of Senator Brown to this place, to part of his policy speech. I remember it very well because he said, `I am going to represent Tasmania and the people of Tasmania and I am going to look after small business and jobs.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I really am starting to worry because, so far, since he has been here the only thing he has not tried to stop is the clock on the GPO. Last week the American aircraft carrier <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Carl Vinson</EMPHASIS> was coming into Hobart, to provide up to $10 million for our little economy in Hobart&mdash;jobs for the young people and some big contracts for some of the firms in Hobart.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, that Williams is trying to put together. Here today we have Senator Brown working against the forestry industry around Australia. I would expect that because that is the brief of the green movement but I would think that, eventually, after the discussions and talk that have been going on in this country for years, some commonsense would prevail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have no doubt that if these regulations are disallowed there will be significant investment projects in Tasmania worth millions of dollars based on value adding that will not go ahead. Confidence, once again, will be at an all-time low. It is common knowledge that if the Greens are successful in their agenda, rural towns such as Triabunna on the east coast will become ghost towns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I look at my state of Tasmania&mdash;and I am a fourth generation Tasmanian; I am not somebody who has just come in here from overseas trying to change the world&mdash;most of the successful industries in Tasmania have been based on primary produce. They have been based on mining, forestry, livestock, agriculture and fishing. As far as the mining industry is concerned, the Green movement in Tasmania will not even go and have a look at the changes that have been made at the former Mount Lyell and Henty gold mines. They have been invited there to see the great changes that have been made in the environmental approach by those particular companies but they will not go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some changes needed to be made with respect to the forestry industry. But no credit has been given. They will keep on trying to stop it and putting people out of work. We still have agriculture to go. I suppose the live sheep trade will be next. I notice Senator Margetts is already trying to stop that. We have not considered fishing yet but no doubt the Greens will get around to that as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week Senator Brown tried to cut $750 million in respect of our budget welfare measures. All I can say is that if we are going <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to stop all these industries, all these businesses and all these activities that generate money in Australia, who in the hell is going to pay for looking after our disadvantaged people in the community? Are we going to keep increasing our overdraft, our bank bill, the budget deficit we picked up?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we heard that extraordinary outburst from Senator Faulkner, who really used some more than colourful language. When he fell out of that tree and broke his leg, something else must have been affected because I have never heard him speak with such colourful and unparliamentary language. His attitude and the Labor Party's attitude is also most surprising. I thought they supported the national forest policy statement and regional forest agreements. Here we have an ongoing attempt to build on that but we find the Labor Party changing their minds for political reasons. Let me quote from a press statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the ALP federal parliamentary party a "sad joke". . . </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ALP's lack of understanding of the importance of the forest and forest products industry to regional Australia coupled with its willingness to use the industry as a political football will ensure that voters, especially those in regional Australia, will continue to keep the ALP in opposition. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Other">To see the ALP politically grandstand against the government's export woodchip regulations on the basis that it is opposed to an increase in the woodchip ceiling is a completely illogical approach. A defeat of the government's regulations would see the current export woodchip ceiling being removed.</PARA>
<PARA>Who made those comments? They were made today by none other than the national secretary of the Construction, Forestry, Mining Employees Union, forestry division, Mr Trevor Smith. Here we have the national secretary of the leading union representing all those people who work in forestry and mining around Australia coming out and telling the truth; he highlights the dilemma that the ALP federal party is in over this. Only last year they were trying to come to some arrangement where we could have a national forest agreement and they could make themselves good fellows with their union mates.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find myself in the very rare situation of disagreeing with my colleague Senator Calvert. Senator Calvert told the Senate that he thought the only thing that the honourable senator opposite, Senator Brown, had not tried to stop was the GPO clock. The reality is that the reason he has not tried to stop it is that he is trying to turn it back. That is really what this motion is all about&mdash;turning the time back to regulations that would not put a ceiling on woodchip exports. Yet that is what he is in here beating his breast about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the astounding thing I find with this motion. If you look at it and ask what would happen if these regulations were repealed, what would be the situation, I would suggest to the Senate, and to those involved in this debate, that there would be a situation which, even from the contorted views of those opposite, would be worse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My colleague Senator Calvert has already referred to the trade union release of the CFMEU entitled `Union attacks ALP woodchip confusion'. That media release is an absolute damning indictment of those opposite. They tell us that they believe in the trade union movement representing the workers and `that is why we have to stand up for them'. I have to say to you that the CFMEU on other occasions, such as on 19 August 1996, was not necessarily engaged in behaviour that people such as myself would agree with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have noted, with some interest, the resignation of one CFMEU official from his union as a result of the events that occurred on 19 August 1996. But, as with most things, every now and then even those who are wrong most of the time do in fact get it right on the odd occasion. On this occasion, the CFMEU has got it right&mdash;they described the ALP federal parliamentary party as a `sad joke'.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The union goes on to say that Labor has learnt nothing from its previous mismanagement of forest policy. Of course, that is why Senator Faulkner worked himself up into the state that he got himself into. He knows that he mismanaged the forest issue and that that mismanagement cost those opposite all the regional seats that they lost at the last election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a very revealing document prepared by Gary Gray and other luminaries in the ALP in trying to dissect the Labor Party defeat on 2 March 1996, the first issue that they raised was the woodchip issue, the forestry issue. They said that the Australian Labor Party had tried to please both the workers and the extreme environmental movement and, in the end, they got neither. Today, what we are seeing in this place is that the Australian Labor Party&mdash;recognising that they got neither the support of the workers or the extreme green movement&mdash;have decided, `We can't straddle the fence because we know what happens to people who sit on barbed wire fences for too long.' So they have decided to jump, and they have jumped to desert the workers in all the timber towns right around Australia and instead are trying to pander to the extreme Greens who are represented in this place and who have moved this motion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was only yesterday that I had the honour of addressing a rally of timber towns in crisis in the electorate of Paterson, so very ably organised by the member for Paterson, Mr Bob Baldwin. There we had 1,500 to 2,000 people; the officials estimate is approximately 2,000 people. They were angry. They were the average workers, those who get their living from the forests. Who were they angry at? They were angry at the Carr government because the Carr government had sold out to the extreme green movement for preferences at the last state election and gained office by 49.5 per cent of the vote and are now paying back the extreme green movement and, as a result, selling out the workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4127"> If you want some emotion, some heartfelt feelings, you would have got them at that rally. You would have seen devastated workers from that part of New South Wales as a result of the sort of dirty, grubby the Austral ian Labor Party will do with the Greens to try to get some perceived political advantage. You cannot really blame the Greens for taking the stance that they are taking. They have to try to remain politically relevant after their agenda has been achieved and so they are becoming more and more extreme and sidelining themselves more and more as time goes by.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The really sad factor in this debate is the Australian Labor Party's support of this extreme green motion. The Labor Party in its report on the last election recognised that they had failed the workers and the extreme green movement. What they have decided to do in this debate is to side with the extreme Greens and thereby desert the workers of Australia in communities right around the regional areas. I have no doubt that as a result seats such as Paterson will now become safe Liberal seats. The average people in those electorates have now realised that the Labor Party are willing to sell them out and that the Labor Party have learnt absolutely nothing from their horrendous election defeat on 2 March 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also interesting to note that the union itself suggests that the shadow environment minister, Carmen Lawrence, and the shadow resource minister, Neil O'Keefe, should be given responsibilities more in tune with their obviously limited abilities. It would have been great to have been able to have seen in this debate some bipartisanship on the basis of some real, solid, robust policy advice. I would seek to develop that theme when I continue my remarks on a later occasion, for which I seek leave.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is our understanding that one of the principal authors of the report prepared by the Office of Government Information and Advertising has, in fact, been offered a lucrative position with Bevins advertising agency. . .</PARA>
<PARA>I wish to put on the public record that John Bevins Pty Ltd, in a recent press release, said the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At no time, either during the tender process or subsequent to it has any offer been made by this agency to any OGIA official.</PARA>
<PARA>Bevins went even further and placed its case on the matter before the Executive Director of the St James Ethics Centre, Mr Simon Longstaff. At point 16 of a statutory declaration signed by Mr Longstaff, he states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In my opinion the assertion that the agency offered the public servant a `lucrative position' is without foundation.</PARA>
<PARA>A further point which indicates that Senator O'Chee was poorly briefed on this matter is his repeated use of the word `he' rather than `she' in reference to the officer concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The officer concerned notified her superior within OGIA, as Public Service ethics guidelines require her to, that, having taken a redundancy package, she was applying for jobs with advertising agencies, and thus signalled her potential conflict of interest. This was an entirely proper course for the officer concerned to take and one which was not replicated by the government members of the ministerial committee on government advertising.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real question is how the officer's declaration under the guidelines became public property and was used by the coalition in the Senate. I ask the question: did the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Jull) or any of his ministerial staff divulge this information to Senator O'Chee or any of his colleagues? If so, why was only part of the information put on the public record and why was it so inaccurate?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government, in its desperation to cover up the gun&hyphen;gate issue, has resorted to smearing a public servant who has abided by Public Service guidelines. Further, having dudded an advertising agency which would have won the contract on merit, they continue to smear that agency with allegations that are untruthful. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4128"> Probably the worst allegation is that the OGIA officer concerned deliberately contributed to an assessment of the tenderers in a biased way but, of course, several people in OGIA were responsible for the assessments, not just this one officer under debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How then does the coalition explain why the qualitative research was so damning of DDB Needham Adelaide, and why did Elliott and Shanahan's research so clearly favour John Bevins's proposal, which the officer about whom these allegations have been made in the Senate had nothing to do with. I am suggesting that, in future, any backbench coalition member who accepts a dud brief from the minister's office check the veracity of it before delivering it in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I find it passing strange that it was left to a backbencher in this place to announce:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The minister has asked the secretary to make a report on the whole proceedings of this matter, because it is highly worrying that a government officer would be the principal author of a report recommending an advertising agency which has offered him&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>it should have been `her'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a very lucrative contract.</PARA>
<PARA>What we saw here on Thursday was an attempt, I think, to undermine the credibility of a public servant and to put a red herring into this chamber. I repeat: Bevins never offered this officer a job&mdash;lucrative or otherwise. I repeat: this officer, having taken a redundancy package, approached a multitude of advertising agencies and, in the process of doing so, approached her senior person at OGIA and informed him or her&mdash;whoever it was&mdash;that there was a potential conflict of interest, as the ethics guidelines from the Public Service would require her to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How was she rewarded for declaring a potential conflict of interest? That information was taken out of the department, used in this chamber&mdash;and only partially used&mdash;to smear that individual. I think it is a great shame that this chamber has been used and abused in such a way.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today mention was made of one of Australia's great conservation figures, Alec Marr, in a disparaging fashion. I rise to acquaint the Senate with the role that this sterling citizen has played in the evolution of conservation thinking in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we sit here, he is on his way to&mdash;or is already at&mdash;the World Conservation Union Conference in Montreal, which is the get together once every three years of the umbrella group of the world's conservation organisations and government officers, the premier world conference on conservation. If the conference is anything like his contribution to the last of these conferences in Buenos Aires in 1993&mdash;I was there with Alec&mdash;he will take one of the lead roles in the outcomes of that conference. Some governments and vested interests may not like it, but when a person is committed&mdash;in this case, it is Alec&mdash;not to the monetary values that seem to be the measure of excellence with so many people in this place but instead to giving his life to trying to rescue this planet from the rapid and serial degradation of its environment he deserves better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Alec Marr came to the Wilderness Society in Hobart a good many years ago&mdash;in the mid&hyphen;1980s. He did not have a tertiary education ticket behind him; he had a much wider and more important ticket, however, and that was in worldly wisdom. From his background as a bricklayer&mdash;maybe that was where he got his contemplation&mdash;he was able to see that things needed fixing. Coming from Newcastle, for a while he brought his sister and his brother and they found themselves in the heat of the Farmhouse Creek dispute south of Hobart, where World Heritage value forests were being invaded by the woodchip companies that are so much still under discussion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4129"> It is a long story, but Alec got out his ropes and went 40 metres up into the lower branches of one of the giant trees which scrape the sky at a height of 80, 90 or 100 metres in the Picton River valley. He sat there on a platform for weeks. It was right in the way of the road. Finally, the woodchip companies brought in two bus loads of loggers as vigi lantes to beat up the conservationists. One of those, Anthony Risby, one of the supremos of one of the logging companies in Tasmania, was later convicted of assault under civil suit. Many others should have been convicted but were not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Alec stayed on his platform in the tree even as these vigilantes drove their chainsaws into the butt of that giant tree. I remember looking out from under a bulldozer in the base of Farmhouse Creek as the same villains swung their chainsaws around among a group of young women hanging onto some small rainforest trees and cut the trees from between their shins. I remember the report of another conservationist who was near throttled by these thugs from the logging companies who were bussed in on that day. I remember watching the police in the invidious position where I believe they had instructions from the then liberal government not to intervene&mdash;in fact, I was told that by one of them&mdash;as they stood helplessly aside with their arms folded. It was, to say the least, an inglorious episode. But throughout it all Alec Marr stayed on his perch.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Later, when the Liberal government of Robin Gray in Tasmania had brought in rules to exclude the media from covering this dispute, they were then able to send in the necessary equipment to finally get Alec out of that tree. But in the meantime he had held up for weeks and weeks the progress of that destructive road into the Farmhouse Creek wilderness and tall eucalypt forests containing some of the tallest flowering plants on the face of the planet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To keep this story short, not long after that that area, due to the national outcry, was protected by being listed as a World Heritage area. The tree in which Alec sat for so long was cut down before that event, but I think he as much as anybody else, if not more than, can take credit for one of the most wonderful forest environments in the world. To its north the devastating clear&hyphen;fell destruction of similar forests is going ahead right now under the hand of this government.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ABC has long been going through its own efficiency measures and has now reached the point, as was acknowledged by the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator Alston, where it is a viable organisation working as efficiently as it can. Those statements were made following the previous inquiry in this place chaired by Senator Alston.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that the ABC is now facing comprehensive cuts of $65 million over a number of years and is faced with the Mansfield review means that we are dealing with far more here than just another efficiency measure by this government. What we are dealing with is a de facto privatisation and dismantling of this public broadcasting service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ABC currently delivers its programs in a far more efficient way than any of their private sector counterparts. Tight budgeting over a number of years has meant that they operate on a very tight budget and, as would be recognised by most Australians, they do that most effectively with the highest quality service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mention the issue of privatisation when talking about the ABC and the cuts because that is where we will be heading. This government, without providing proper funding support, will not allow the ABC to be able to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4130"> grow and develop and to continue in a niche market in some areas and the broader market in other areas where it has served the community so well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The alliance formed yesterday in Canberra brings into focus just how far and wide the ABC gathers its support. Whether it is the local radio station 2CN or some of the regional radio stations based in Bega, Albury and Wagga providing that support, there is no doubt that groups of people are prepared not just to put their names to a petition or write letters but come together to work out ways in which they can take this campaign to the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To give senators an idea of the groups that were involved in this alliance and represented at yesterday's meeting, I will read them out: the Australian Youth Policy Action Coalition; the Australian Computer Society; the ANU Students Association; the Canberra Blind Society; Canberra Community Orchestra; Canberra Institute of Technology Students Association; the Canberra Philharmonic Society; Canberra Youth Orchestra Society; Canberra Youth Theatre; Conservation Council of the South-East Region and Canberra; Council for Civil Liberties; Country Women's Association, of which there were three representatives at the meeting; the Community and Public Sector Union; Craft Council of the ACT; Ethnic Communities Council of the ACT; Friends of the ABC (ACT and Region); Friends of the ABC (Bega); Friends of the ABC (Eurobodalla); Friends of the National Library of Australia; the Institute of Museum and Gallery Education; National Alliance for the Arts; National Council of Women of the ACT; the National Film and Sound Archive; National Seniors Association; the Ngunnawal Aboriginal Land Council, Reel McCoy; the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance; the Trades and Labour Council of the ACT; the University of Canberra Students Association; and the Welfare Rights and Legal Centre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Individuals who spoke in support of the Alliance for a Comprehensive ABC included Bishop Pat Power, who is the Auxiliary Bishop of Canberra and Goulburn; Professor Ken Inglis, who wrote about the history of the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ABC; and Mr Kevin Neil, who is the Chief Executive of the Canberra Raiders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The meeting brought together an interesting group of people and reaffirmed in my mind the devastation, the pain and the concern that cuts to the ABC will cause not only in Canberra and the surrounding country regions but right throughout Australia. This group will continue to campaign in a way they think best and will continue to approach government ministers and representatives to urge them not to proceed with the cuts that have been mooted for the ABC. This group are calling upon everybody in the parliament to address these specific issues and to take note of their wholehearted community concern surrounding the cuts to the ABC.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<TITLE>Edmund Rice: Beatification</TITLE>

<STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(7.37 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I rise to speak of Edmund Rice, the founder of the Christian Brothers, who was beatified in Rome on 6 October this year. Just recently we have witnessed the beatification of Mary MacKillop, an Australian nun, and the similarities between them are quite remarkable. The process of beatification is a rigorous one and is widely seen as a step towards sainthood.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, let me say something of the history of the man Edmund Rice. Edmund Ignatius Rice was born in Callan, a small town in County Kilkenny, Ireland, in 1762 and he died at Waterford in 1844. During his life he acquired a well documented reputation as a person who did good works and was a successful businessman. One might think that is a rather hard task to achieve, bearing in mind that on the one hand you have charity and on the other hand you have commerce.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was apprenticed to his uncle Michael, who was a wealthy merchant in the thriving southern city port of Waterford. He was aged 17 and was fully conversant with livestock and the provision trade. He eventually inherited that business, but did not give up or desist from his work for the poor. If he stood out amongst his contemporaries, it was because of the deeply personal aspect of his solicitude. He did more than give money to the needy; <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4131"> he gave them his time, his hospitality and, finally, his very life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After a full day's work, he put in long hours aiding orphans, elderly and homeless people. He was an active member of several organisations which raised funds for charitable institutions. He often served as an advocate to obtain rights and benefits for persons too poor to hire a lawyer. In fact, he assisted anyone in need. Of special concern to him were the wild and uncared for boys who gathered around the timber stacks on the quay. He brought them to his home in Barrack Street and provided them with food and clothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Edmund Rice was also a scholar and one of the subscribers to the 1791 edition of the Douay Bible, which he read very carefully. He opposed vehemently usury and the exploitation of the poor and any other of the injustices which were then rampant in society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In spite of government pressure on Catholics in 18th century Ireland, Edmund Rice made no secret of his faith. He attended mass daily in Waterford churches and joined other men in prayer or action groups to promote his religion. He was an adviser and friend to many priests and a bishop.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He married Mary Elliot when he was aged 25. Two years later his young wife died giving birth to their daughter, who never developed normally. His wife's death was a watershed in his life and for the next 13 years he sought out a reason and meaning for the suffering that she had endured.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He finally made up his mind to sell his successful business and to devote the rest of his life to teaching the poor gratuitously. In 1802 as a layman he founded a community of teaching brothers that would eventually become two separate congregations in the church&mdash;the Presentation Brothers and the Christian Brothers. Nearly 200 years later, the Christian Brothers order is active in some 30 countries around the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Edmund Rice's first attempt to establish a school was a venture in a rented building which was a stable on New Street in Waterford, where he conducted a free school for the poorest boys in the city. He hired teachers to assist him, but after a few weeks they quit <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> because the work was so difficult. Of course, these boys had never been to a school like that before. In fact, none of them had been near any form of education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He continued alone with some 150 boys to instruct. At the end of the year, two young men from Callan volunteered their services and they moved into a loft above the stable to live with Edmund Rice. This was the inauspicious beginning of the Christian Brothers. In 1809 they were allowed to take religious vows. By this time there were five brothers and they had moved to their newly constructed school called Mount Sion. There were many schools in Waterford at this time, but none for boys that were unable to pay for their education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Political conditions in Ireland at this time militated against schools such as Mount Sion. Thus, in giving up his prosperous business and his comfortable home, Edmund Rice was embarking on a career that would result in giving hope and new life to children who were faced with the prospect of no education nor any advancement.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4132">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Throughout the world Christian Brothers have been responsible for the education of millions of children. In Australia today Christian Brothers have educated approximately 500,000 children in over 80 schools since their arrival in Melbourne in 1867. Christian Brothers, I believe, continue the commitment that Edmund Rice showed nearly 200 years ago in their education commitment to young children not only in this country but worldwide. It is worth while that the Senate note the beatification of this great man which occurred, as I say, this month in Rome.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Telstra advises that it is responsible for the installation of a repeater near Mt Donaldson in north&hyphen;west Tasmania. However, it advises that the map reference for the site the honourable senator has referred to is incorrect. Telstra's repeater is located at map reference Zone 55, Easting 340900, Northing 539400 near the Pieman River State Reserve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Telstra further advises that the repeater was installed to upgrade a service to customers in Corinna, whose service had been experiencing difficulties with marginal performance. The provision of a repeater at the site was considered the only reasonable way of providing the service required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) I have been advised by the Department of Communications and the Arts that the site is located within the Tarkine Wilderness which, I have also been advised, was entered in the interim list for the Register of the National Estate on 30 May 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) No. Before installing the Facility, I am advised Telstra notified the relevant State authority, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4133"> in this case the Tasmanian Department of Environment and Land Management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department of Environment and Land Management advised Telstra that the proposed site for the repeater was under the control of Forestry Tasmania. Telstra subsequently held negotiations with Forestry Tasmania leading to the establishment of a lease for the site on 30 May 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Telstra advises that it did not notify the Australian Heritage Commission at the time of its proposal to install the repeater as it had formed the view, on the basis of advice from the Department of Environment and Land Management, that the facility was not likely to have a significant effect on a place, or its immediate surroundings, that is entered in either the Register of the National Estate or the interim list for the Register of the National Estate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department of Communications and the Arts has subsequently notified all relevant parties of this development and requested AUSTEL, which has responsibility for monitoring compliance with the Telecommunications National Code, to investigate this matter in consultation with the Australian Heritage Commission and Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recent advice from Telstra indicates that it is seeking to address this outstanding requirement under the Telecommunications National Code (that is, to provide the Australian Heritage Commission with enough information to assess the impact of the installation) as a matter of priority. I understand that the Australian Heritage Commission has agreed to undertake an urgent assessment of the impact of the installation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) In accordance with the Telecommunications National Code, Telstra advises that a Prescribed Activity Notice was prepared for the proposed installation and forwarded to:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The Equestrian Federation of Australia (EFA) is a recognised national sporting organisation currently receiving funding under the Federal Government's sports assistance programs, which are administered by the Australian Sports Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) In 1995/96 the EFA received grants from the Sports Assistance Scheme ($431,720) and the Olympic Athlete Program ($729,600) totalling $1,161,320. A copy of the terms and conditions pertaining to grant expenditure and acquittal has been provided to the honourable senator, as printed below.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The EFA is not responsible for rules governing use of the whip at race meetings. It only deals with matters regarding the use of whips during sporting contests conducted by its three disciplines (eventing, show jumping and dressage) where the general ethos is that the welfare of the horse is paramount.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) Since the release of a report in 1991 by the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare, the Australian Conference of Principal Clubs (ACPC) has added specific requirements to the Australian Rules of Racing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In October 1994 the Australian Rules of Racing (137A) were extended to include the following : <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4134"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i) Stewards may punish any rider who, in a race, or trial, or trackwork, uses his whip in an excessive, unnecessary or improper manner;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii) Stewards may punish any rider who in a race or trial uses his whip&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) forward of the horse's shoulder or in the vicinity of his head;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) when the horse is out of contention; or</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) when the horse is showing no response; or</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) when the horse is clearly winning; or</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) when the horse has passed the winning post.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) Rules governing the use of the whip in the United Kingdom are slightly more stringent than those governing the use of the whip in Australia. In the UK a jockey is restricted in the number of times he or she can use the whip on a horse when it is in the straight. In Australia there is no limit to the number of a times a jockey can use the whip on a horse when it is in the straight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) The use of the whip at race meetings is governed by the Australian Conference of Principal Clubs which includes the AJC, VRC and all principal racing clubs throughout Australia. This Conference sets the Australian Rules of Racing which govern the use of whips at race meetings throughout Australia.
